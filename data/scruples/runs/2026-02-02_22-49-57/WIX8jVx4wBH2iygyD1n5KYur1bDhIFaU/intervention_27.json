One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, and his girlfriend got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and Annie drank, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend found out later and felt it was inappropriate. She also mentioned past incidents where Annie was affectionate towards the author when the girlfriend was nearby. The author didn't mean anything by it and thought of Annie as a friend. Additionally, he mentioned in the past that Annie would be his choice for a threesome, which the girlfriend found problematic.\n\nSo, from the girlfriend's perspective, she's upset because the sleepover happened without her knowledge, and the previous interactions made her uncomfortable. The author might not have realized how these actions affected her. But the author didn't intentionally cross boundaries. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not considering her feelings or not setting up clear boundaries with Annie.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims he didn't do anything wrong because he didn't initiate anything. However, the fact that they discussed threesomes and picked friends (including Annie) might have contributed to the girlfriend's insecurity. Even if it was in a joking manner, it could have implications. The author's hyper-awareness now might affect his friendship, but that's more about his reaction than the initial act.\n\nIs the author at fault for the sleepover? Maybe not, as it wasn't malicious. But he could have been more considerate of his girlfriend's feelings by checking in with her or avoiding situations that might cause discomfort. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because her feelings matter in the relationship. The author should have been more mindful of her perspective, even if he didn't have bad intentions.\n\nBut the main issue is whether he's in the wrong. Since he didn't act with malice and it was a mistake in judgment rather than a deliberate betrayal, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. However, the fact that he mentioned Annie in the threesome conversation could have been a red flag he overlooked. So, there's some responsibility on his part for not addressing her feelings proactively.\n\nIn terms of the answer, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But considering both sides, maybe there's a balance. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, if the author's actions, though unintentional, caused harm without his awareness, he might share some responsibility. But if the girlfriend's reaction is disproportionate, then maybe not. The key is whether the actions were objectively wrong. Since the sleepover wasn't a physical affair but a friendship situation, and the girlfriend's feelings were hurt due to past context, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. However, he could have handled things better. So, the answer might be B, but with nuances.\n"
