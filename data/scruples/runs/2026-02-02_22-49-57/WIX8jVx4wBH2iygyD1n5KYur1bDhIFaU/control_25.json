One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, not asking his girlfriend about it. The girlfriend was upset, thinking it was inappropriate, especially given past conversations where the guy mentioned wanting to have threesomes with that friend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy and his friend had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep together. He didn't plan it as a sleepover but ended up with her in his room. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. She mentioned that the friend had crossed boundaries before, like holding his hand and playing with his hair while the girlfriend was nearby. Also, there was a prior conversation where the guy jokingly said he'd have a threesome with this friend, which the girlfriend brings up now as a reason for her anger.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, but the author didn't intend anything wrong. However, relationships often involve communication and respecting boundaries. Even if the friend didn't plan the sleepover, the fact that he let her stay in his room and they fell asleep together might not have been considered from the girlfriend's perspective. The prior comments about threesomes could have made the girlfriend feel vulnerable or uneasy when this situation happened.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend didn't initiate anything, and it was accidental. The author didn't do anything to intentionally make the girlfriend upset. The girlfriend might be overreacting because of her own insecurities or past issues. But in relationships, even if something is accidental, not considering the partner's feelings and the context (like previous jokes about threesomes) might be a problem. The author didn't check in with his girlfriend before the sleepover, which is a valid point. Friends sleeping in the same room can be acceptable, but in a romantic relationship, boundaries are important. The friend's actions, even if innocent, could be seen as crossing a line depending on the partner's comfort level.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not realizing how his actions could affect his girlfriend, especially given the prior conversation about threesomes. Even if he didn't mean anything by it, not considering her feelings is a mistake. Alternatively, the girlfriend might be overreacting because of her own issues. But since the question is about the author's responsibility, the answer might lean towards A (wrong) because he should have been more mindful of his girlfriend's feelings and their relationship boundaries, even if unintentionally.\n"
