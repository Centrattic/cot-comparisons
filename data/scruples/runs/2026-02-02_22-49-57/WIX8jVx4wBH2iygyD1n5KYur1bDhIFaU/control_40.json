One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie, and didn't ask his girlfriend. They ended up falling asleep in the same bed. The girlfriend was at a concert and didn't come over because they decided not to go to the party. The next day, he told her, and she was upset. She mentioned some past interactions where Annie had touched him (like playing with his hair, holding his hand) which he didn't realize had bothered her. Also, he had joked about having a threesome with Annie in the past.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did he do something wrong by having the sleepover without consulting his girlfriend, and by not noticing her discomfort before? The girlfriend says he didn't initiate the overstepping, but the fact that he didn't notice her feelings might be an issue. Also, the mention of the threesome joke could have triggered her insecurities.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if the guy didn't mean anything by it, the girlfriend's trust and comfort matter. Having a sleepover with a close friend without informing the partner can come off as dismissive of the partner's feelings. Also, the past comments about having a threesome with Annie might have added to her anxiety. The guy might have a point in feeling the situation was blown out of proportion, but he also should have considered that his actions could affect her, even if he didn't have bad intentions. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he didn't do anything intentionally harmful, but he might be at fault for not being mindful of how his actions could impact his girlfriend's feelings. The fact that he's now hyper-aware and fears changing his friendship with Annie might indicate he's trying to be better, but the initial act of not discussing the sleepover could be seen as a mistake. It's a bit of a gray area. Typically, in such scenarios, the person is expected to check in with their partner about spending the night with someone else, especially if they're close friends. Also, the past comments about a threesome with Annie might have made the situation more sensitive. \n\nTherefore, it's possible that the author is in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's feelings in the actions he took, even if he didn't have any malicious intent. The answer might lean towards A, but I need to check if there's a clear wrong here. Since he didn't initiate the touching, but the sleepover and the previous joke could have contributed to her discomfort, maybe it's a mix. However, the main issue is the lack of communication about the sleepover. So, probably the answer is A. The author is in the wrong for not discussing the sleepover and not being attuned to his girlfriend's feelings in general.\n"
