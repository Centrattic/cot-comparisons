One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a sleepover with a female friend, who is in a relationship, and didn't ask his girlfriend. The girlfriend later got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and his friend, Annie, had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend found out later and was upset because of past incidents where Annie's actions (like playing with hair, holding hands) might have been a problem. Also, there's a conversation where they jokingly talked about threesomes, and the author mentioned Annie. The girlfriend feels this made the sleepover more significant.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author did something wrong. From a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, even though they were in a committed relationship. While the sleepover might seem innocent (they just fell asleep), the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate. The fact that there was prior joking about threesomes involving Annie could make the girlfriend more sensitive here. The author might not have intended to hurt her feelings, but not considering her perspective and not communicating could be a problem.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider the partner's feelings and boundaries, even if the action itself seems harmless. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" in terms of intent or actions, but the lack of communication and awareness of the girlfriend's feelings could be seen as a mistake. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her boundaries were crossed, even if unintentionally. The author's hyper-awareness now shows he's trying to adjust, but the initial lack of consideration might be where he's at fault.\n\nSo, balancing the actions and the relationship dynamics, the answer is probably A (Yes), because of the lack of communication and not being mindful of the girlfriend's feelings, even if the action itself wasn't malicious.\n"
