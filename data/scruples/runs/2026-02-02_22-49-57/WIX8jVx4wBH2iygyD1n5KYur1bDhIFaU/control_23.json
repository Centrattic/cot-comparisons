One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves the author having a friend (Annie) sleep over in their bed, which the girlfriend found upsetting. The key points are: the author didn't do anything intentionally wrong, they thought nothing of it, and the issue seems to stem from past jokes about threesomes and Annie's behavior.\n\nFirst, the author and Annie fell asleep in the same bed after a night of drinking. Even though they were friends, sharing a bed can be a sensitive issue in a relationship. The girlfriend was upset not just because of the sleepover but also because of past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand when the girlfriend was nearby. The author didn't notice these things, which shows a lack of awareness of their girlfriend's feelings.\n\nThe girlfriend brought up the sleepover in the context of previous conversations where the author had joked about wanting a threesome with Annie. Even if it was just a joke, mentioning someone else in that context can plant seeds of insecurity. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about feeling overlooked in those jokes and the lack of consideration for her feelings during Annie's interactions. \n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't initiate anything and didn't see the issue, but their lack of awareness and the context of past jokes could contribute to the girlfriend feeling insecure. The author now feels hyper-aware of how they act around Annie, which affects their friendship. However, the girlfriend's concern is valid because the situation, even if accidental, could be perceived as a boundary issue. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's a lack of awareness and communication. The main question is whether the girlfriend overreacted. Since the sleepover itself didn't involve any physical contact or intention to hurt, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's room for the girlfriend's feelings to be considered. However, the key here is that the author acted without malice, even if the girlfriend felt hurt. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
