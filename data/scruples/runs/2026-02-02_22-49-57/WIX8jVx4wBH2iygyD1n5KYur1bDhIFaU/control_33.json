One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a sleepover with a female friend (Annie) who's in a long-term relationship. The girlfriend found out and got upset, leading to a discussion about boundaries and past comments about threesomes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author didn't initiate anything with Annie, but they did have her over when the girlfriend wasn't around. They fell asleep together in the author's room. The girlfriend was upset about this and mentioned other instances where Annie might have crossed boundaries, like holding hands or playing with hair. The author had previously joked about wanting to have a threesome with Annie, which the girlfriend now brings up as a context for her feelings.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about the relationship dynamics. The girlfriend feels uncomfortable with the sleepover and the past interactions. Even if the author didn't do anything intentionally, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. In relationships, communication and respecting each other's boundaries are crucial. The author might not have realized how the sleepover could make his girlfriend feel, especially given the prior comments about threesomes.\n\nBut also, the situation isn't entirely the author's fault. The sleepover was with a friend who's in a relationship, which could be a red flag. The author didn't act on any intentions, but the fact that they allowed Annie to stay over without considering the girlfriend's perspective might be an issue. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling insecure and hurt by the lack of awareness from the author.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be overreacting if the author had no ill intentions. But in relationships, the perception and feelings matter, even if they stem from past jokes or behaviors. The author's awareness of their actions' impact on the girlfriend is part of maintaining trust.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author didn't act with malice, but they didn't consider the girlfriend's feelings adequately, especially with the context of previous comments. The girlfriend's reaction, while maybe intense, is about her feelings being hurt. The author might be in the right in terms of not initiating anything, but they could have been more mindful of how the situation might affect their partner. Therefore, the answer might be a bit nuanced, but typically in such scenarios, if the girlfriend feels hurt and the author didn't take her feelings into account, the author could be seen as partially at fault. However, the girlfriend's reaction might also be a bit overblown given the circumstances. \n\nBut given the context of the previous comments about threesomes, the author's unawareness of the girlfriend's discomfort, and the fact that the sleepover happened without the girlfriend's knowledge, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but it's a close call. The key is whether the author had intent to cross boundaries. Since there's no intent, but there's a lack of communication and awareness, it's a tricky situation. But the girlfriend's feelings are valid, so the author might not be entirely in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
