One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation involving a sleepover with a friend and their girlfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the context: The author (21M) had a friend (Annie, 22F) come over before a party. They ended up not going, watched TV, smoked, fell asleep in the author's room. The author's girlfriend (20F) was at a concert but didn't know. The next day, the author told her, and the girlfriend was upset. She brought up past instances where Annie was overly affectionate, like holding hands and playing with hair. The author mentioned in the past that if they ever had a threesome, it would be with Annie, which the girlfriend found hurtful.\n\nThe author feels the girlfriend overreacted but is concerned about their friendship with Annie. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, transparency is key. The author didn't inform the girlfriend about the sleepover. Even if it was a mistake or an accident, the girlfriend had the right to know. The fact that they fell asleep together in the same bed, especially when the girlfriend was elsewhere, could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling excluded or uncommunicated with.\n\nAdditionally, the past comments about threesomes involving Annie likely influenced the girlfriend's perception. Even if it was in a joking context, those comments could be seen as disrespectful or dismissive of the girlfriend's feelings. The author might not have intended harm, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The author's lack of awareness of how their actions affected the girlfriend is a point to consider.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate the sleepover or the previous affectionate interactions. The situations happened, but the author didn't have malicious intent. The main issue might be the communication gap. The author didn't realize the girlfriend's discomfort with Annie's behavior until after the fact.\n\nSo, in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's a bit nuanced. If the author had communicated proactively and been more aware of the girlfriend's boundaries, maybe they could have avoided the conflict. However, the situation is more about miscommunication and differing expectations rather than intentional wrongdoing. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt and unacknowledged, but the author didn't set out to harm her. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong, but there's a need for better communication and understanding between the couple. The girlfriend's feelings are important, and the author should work on being more attuned to her perspectives in the future. The main issue isn't malicious intent but rather a lack of awareness and communication.\n"
