One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy (21M) having a sleepover with his female friend (22F, Annie) in his room, leading to them both falling asleep. The girlfriend (20F) found out and got upset, partly because of previous interactions where Annie had touched him, like playing with his hair and holding his hand at a festival. Plus, the guy had jokingly mentioned Annie in the context of potential threesomes during their conversations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't initiate the sleepover; it was a last-minute plan after a friend bailed. They were in the TV room, fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert with her own friend. The author didn't realize the issue until the next day. The girlfriend's main concerns are about the boundaries and the prior conversation about threesomes involving Annie.\n\nNow, from a relationship perspective, trust and communication are key. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, the fact that his friend was in his bed and they fell asleep could be seen as overstepping if the girlfriend felt it. The previous instances (hand-holding, hair-playing) might have built up to this point. The author might not have realized how his actions, even if innocent, could make the girlfriend feel insecure or neglected.\n\nThe part about the threesome conversation is crucial. Even if it was a joke, bringing up that they considered each other's preferences in friends could imply some openness to such scenarios, which might have made the girlfriend feel that the author isn't as exclusive as she thought. So even if the author didn't do anything wrong, the girlfriend's feelings are valid because of that underlying tension.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't intentionally cross a boundary. He didn't plan the sleepover, and the situation was a result of friends bailing. The fact that the girlfriend brought up the prior touches suggests that maybe she had been feeling this way for a while and this was the tipping point. The author's lack of awareness of her feelings is a problem, but it doesn't necessarily mean he's in the wrong. It might be more about communication and understanding each other's needs.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not directly, since he didn't intend to hurt his girlfriend. However, there's a responsibility in a relationship to be aware of what might make your partner uncomfortable, especially after previous discussions. The author might be at fault for not being more attentive to the girlfriend's potential discomfort, even if he didn't mean for it to happen. But given that the girlfriend's upset is tied to that specific conversation about threesomes, which the author had mentioned, it's a mix of both parties' perspectives.\n\nIn the end, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were willfully inconsiderate. Since he didn't realize the issue until the next day and the situation was accidental, he's likely not in the wrong. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid because of the prior context. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
