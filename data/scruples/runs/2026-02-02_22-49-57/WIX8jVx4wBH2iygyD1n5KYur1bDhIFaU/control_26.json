One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend in his room without telling his girlfriend. The girlfriend was upset about it, citing past instances where the friend might have crossed boundaries and a previous joke about threesomes.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the main points. The author didn't do anything intentionally wrong, but he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings, even though they had discussed things like threesomes in a joking manner. The girlfriend felt hurt and saw it as a breach of trust because of past conversations. \n\nThe key factors here are communication and boundaries. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, not informing his girlfriend about the sleepover could be seen as a lack of consideration. Also, the fact that they had joked about threesomes might have made the girlfriend more sensitive to the situation. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to be mindful of each other's feelings and boundaries. The author might not have realized how much the girlfriend was affected by the past comments, but he should have communicated the sleepover to her. The fact that he didn't think to ask her before the sleepover shows a lack of awareness of her feelings, which could be seen as his fault. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be overreacting if the sleepover itself was innocent. But considering the context of their previous discussions and the specific mention of that friend, her reaction is more understandable. The author's inconsiderate action, even if unintentional, could still be seen as his fault because he didn't prioritize his girlfriend's feelings in this scenario.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because he failed to communicate and consider his girlfriend's perspective, even if the action itself wasn't malicious.\n"
