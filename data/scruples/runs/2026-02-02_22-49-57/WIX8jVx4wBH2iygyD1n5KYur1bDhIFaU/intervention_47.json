One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person sharing the story) is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's friend Annie came over for drinks, they ended up in his room, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. The key points here are that the author didn't ask his girlfriend before having the sleepover, and the girlfriend felt that Annie's behavior (like holding his hand) was crossing boundaries. Also, the author had jokingly mentioned in the past that he would choose Annie for a threesome, which seems to have made the girlfriend more sensitive about this situation.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a 2-year relationship, which is a significant commitment. When someone is in a committed relationship, they might have expectations about their partner's interactions with the opposite sex. The fact that they had discussed threesomes and the author mentioned Annie specifically might have planted a seed of insecurity or jealousy. The girlfriend is pointing out that the author didn't notice her discomfort with Annie's actions before. That's a valid concern because in a relationship, partners should be aware of each other's feelings and boundaries, even if they don't realize it at first.\n\nThe author's actions themselves\u2014sleeping in the same bed with a friend, even if they didn't have a romantic relationship\u2014could be seen as crossing a line, depending on the couple's agreed-upon norms. If the girlfriend wasn't informed, it might be a breach of trust, even if unintentional. The author thought nothing of it for days, which shows a lack of awareness about how his actions might affect her. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have any malicious intent. He didn't initiate anything, and he's now trying to adjust his behavior. But the problem here is not just the sleepover itself, but the lack of communication and the failure to consider the girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction might seem overblown, but her concerns are rooted in the past conversation about threesomes and Annie's behavior. She might feel that the author wasn't transparent and that his actions, even if innocent, could lead to misunderstandings.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have considered his girlfriend's perspective and communicated better. Even if the sleepover was innocent, not discussing it with her could be seen as dismissive. The fact that he later mentioned Annie in the context of threesomes adds context to her hurt feelings. So while the author isn't necessarily in the wrong in a malicious sense, he might be at fault for not respecting his girlfriend's potential insecurities and not being proactive in communication.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is a bit nuanced. The author might not be intentionally wrong, but he did overlook his girlfriend's feelings. Therefore, he could be considered in the wrong for not being more aware and communicative. But the user's initial thought was that the author isn't in the wrong, which is understandable. However, in the context of a relationship, mutual respect and communication are key, and the author's lack of communication here might make him at least partially responsible.\n"
