One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing their girlfriend. The situation involves the friend falling asleep in the author's bed while the girlfriend was out. The girlfriend was upset because of past instances where the friend crossed boundaries and a previous joke about threesomes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The author mentions they've been in a relationship for two years and love their girlfriend. The key points here are that the friend fell asleep in the bed without the author initiating it, and the author didn't realize it bothered the girlfriend until she brought it up. Also, there was a prior conversation about threesomes where the author mentioned the friend, which might have triggered the girlfriend's insecurities.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is crucial. The author didn't think to check in with their girlfriend beforehand, which might have been a misstep. However, the act itself\u2014two friends falling asleep in the same bed\u2014might not be inherently wrong, but it can be a touchy issue depending on the couple's agreed-upon boundaries. The girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from past behavior and a joke that she took seriously, leading to her feeling hurt.\n\nThe author's responsibility here could be questioned in terms of not being aware of their girlfriend's feelings, especially after discussing threesomes. Even if the author didn't have bad intentions, not considering how their actions might affect the girlfriend's emotions is a point to consider. However, the author didn't act with malice, and the situation wasn't intentional. The girlfriend's reaction, while valid emotionally, might be seen as overreacting if there's no prior history of similar issues causing problems.\n\nAnother angle is the friendship with Annie. The author is now worried about their friendship being affected, which is understandable, but the main issue is the girlfriend's perspective. The fact that the girlfriend acknowledged the author didn't initiate the situation but still felt hurt suggests that communication between the couple is key here. The author might need to have a deeper conversation to understand her feelings better, but it's not clear if the author was in the wrong.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author might not be in the wrong because the situation wasn't intentional, and they didn't act with the intent to hurt their girlfriend. However, there's a lesson here about being more attentive to the girlfriend's feelings, especially regarding past comments. The answer might lean towards B (No), but it's a close call depending on how one views the importance of prior conversations about threesomes.\n"
