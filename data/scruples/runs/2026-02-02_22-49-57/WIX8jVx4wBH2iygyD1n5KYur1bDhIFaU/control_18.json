One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with their male friend and not informing their girlfriend. The key points here are the context of the situation and the girlfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author's friend Annie came over for drinks before a party. Their original plan was to go to the party, but when the friend bailed, they stayed in the author's room to watch TV and smoked. They fell asleep together in the bed. The girlfriend was at a concert and didn't come over. The author told her the next day but didn't think it was a big deal. Then, the girlfriend later confronted the author about Annie overstepping boundaries in the past, like playing with hair and holding hands at a festival, and a previous conversation where the author joked about having a threesome with Annie. The author now feels the girlfriend overreacted and is worried about the friendship.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author did something wrong by allowing Annie to sleep in their bed without informing the girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because of past interactions and the comment about a threesome. Even if the author didn't intend anything, the girlfriend's feelings are important. In relationships, communication is key. The author might not have done anything intentionally inappropriate, but the girlfriend's perspective is valid. Also, the previous joke about a threesome could have planted a seed in the girlfriend's mind, making the sleepover seem more significant. The author should have considered their girlfriend's feelings and perhaps informed her before the sleepover, even if it was just a joke. Not acknowledging the girlfriend's emotional response might contribute to the problem. So, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because of the lack of communication, but I need to check if the actions were genuinely harmless.\n"
