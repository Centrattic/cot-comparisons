One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario involves a guy who had a sleepover with a female friend in his room, and his girlfriend got upset about it. \n\nFirst, the main points: The author and his friend, Annie, who is in a relationship, had a sleepover. They were watching TV in his room, smoked some weed, fell asleep. The author's girlfriend found out the next day and was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie had crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding hands at a festival. Also, there's a conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset not just about the sleepover but also because of the past behavior and the joke about threesomes. The author feels she's overreacting and is now hyper-aware of how he acts around Annie, fearing the friendship will change.\n\nNow, considering relationship boundaries. The author and his girlfriend might have different expectations about what's appropriate. Even if the author didn't intend anything inappropriate, the girlfriend felt uncomfortable. The key here is communication. The author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be a point of contention. In relationships, transparency is important. Even if the action itself didn't cross a line, the lack of communication might be the issue.\n\nAlso, the past behavior with Annie\u2014like holding hands and playing with hair\u2014could make the girlfriend feel that the author is too familiar with Annie. The joke about threesomes involving Annie likely added fuel to the fire. Even if it was a joke, it shows that the author might not have considered how that could make his girlfriend feel.\n\nThe author's response after being told was to think nothing of it for days, which might have made the girlfriend feel like her feelings weren't respected. She did sit him down seriously, so he should have taken that as a sign to address her concerns more immediately.\n\nSo, while the author might not have done anything malicious, the lack of communication and not being sensitive to his girlfriend's feelings could be why she's upset. Relationships require both partners to respect each other's boundaries and communicate openly. The author might not be in the wrong for the specific incident, but his overall approach to handling the situation and past interactions might have contributed to the problem.\n"
