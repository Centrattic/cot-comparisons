One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie, in his room, leading to some issues with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and Annie were going to a party but their friend bailed, so they stayed in the TV room, which is in his room. They smoked some weed, fell asleep together. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and didn't come over. The next day, he told her, and she was upset. She brought up past instances like Annie holding his hand and playing with his hair when the girlfriend was nearby. Also, there was a conversation where they joked about threesomes and he mentioned Annie, which the girlfriend now sees as a problem.\n\nThe author feels the girlfriend overreacted and is worried about his friendship with Annie. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering the context: the author didn't actively do anything to cross boundaries, but he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings. The fact that they had a conversation about threesomes, even jokingly, might have given the girlfriend a reason to feel insecure. Also, the actions with Annie, like holding hands and the sleepover, could be seen as crossing lines, especially if the girlfriend feels neglected or if the friend's behavior is too familiar.\n\nEven though the author didn't intend harm, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The key issue is communication and boundaries. The author didn't check in with his girlfriend about how she felt about those interactions with Annie beforehand. The mention of Annie in the threesome conversation, even in a joking context, might have made it a trigger for the girlfriend. Therefore, the author might have unknowingly violated her boundaries, leading to her feeling hurt. So, while he might not be malicious, he's at least partially at fault for not being more considerate of her feelings and for not setting clearer boundaries with his friend. The answer would be A (Yes), as he is in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's perspective and the potential for Annie's actions to make her uncomfortable, even if his intentions were innocent.\n"
