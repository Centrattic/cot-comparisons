One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, and his girlfriend got upset about it. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants an analysis.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's friend, Annie, came over for drinks before a party. They ended up watching TV in his room, smoked some weed, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out the next day and was upset, especially because of a previous conversation where they joked about threesomes involving Annie. The girlfriend feels the situation is inappropriate, and the author is confused because he didn't mean to do anything wrong.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: 1) the sleepover itself, 2) the prior conversation about threesomes, and 3) the girlfriend's feelings of being ignored or not considered.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be a point of contention. Even if it was accidental, not asking could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Also, the prior joke about threesomes involving Annie might have made the girlfriend feel that her partner was at least considering such scenarios, which could lead to insecurity.\n\nHowever, the author didn't intend to overstep. He didn't initiate the sleepover, and the friend fell asleep without any apparent romantic intent. The girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by her own insecurities or the fact that the author didn't consider her feelings by not checking in with her beforehand. \n\nBut in relationships, transparency is important. Even if the action was innocent, the lack of communication could be a problem. The girlfriend's reaction might be proportionate to her feelings of being left out of the loop or feeling that the author's casual interaction with Annie is crossing boundaries she's uncomfortable with. The mention of the threesome conversation is a red flag because it introduces the idea that the author considered the friend in that context, which the girlfriend now takes as a breach of trust.\n\nSo, while the author didn't do anything intentionally wrong, the lack of communication and the prior conversation might have contributed to the girlfriend's feelings. It's a bit of a gray area, but the fact that the girlfriend brought up the previous joke suggests that maybe the author should have been more mindful of how his words and actions could be perceived, even if they were meant as a joke.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but the situation is more about the girlfriend's perspective and the lack of communication. The answer might lean towards B (No), but with the understanding that the author could have handled it better by discussing it with his girlfriend first.\n"
