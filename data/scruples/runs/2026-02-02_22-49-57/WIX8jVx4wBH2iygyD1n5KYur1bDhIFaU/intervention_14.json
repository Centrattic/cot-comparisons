One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The situation involves a guy (21M) who had a sleepover with his friend Annie (22F) without informing his girlfriend (20F). They both ended up in his bed, but the main issue is the girlfriend's reaction based on prior conversations about threesomes.\n\nFirst, the immediate situation: The author didn't plan the sleepover, it was spontaneous after a friend bailed. They smoked, watched TV, and fell asleep. No one initiated anything beyond that. The girlfriend was at a concert with her own friend and didn't come over. The author didn't do anything intentionally wrong, as he was just being friends with Annie.\n\nBut the girlfriend was upset because of the friend being in the bed and the previous joke about threesomes. Even though they were just exploring tastes and not serious, the author's comment about Annie might have planted a seed of doubt. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate because they ended up in the same bed, and the prior conversation made her more sensitive.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. He didn't plan the sleepover, didn't initiate the physical contact, and didn't do anything with Annie that night. However, the fact that he mentioned Annie in the context of a threesome, even in a joking manner, could be hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt uncomfortable and the situation could be misinterpreted, even if unintentionally. The author should have been more considerate of his girlfriend's feelings, especially after discussing sensitive topics. But he didn't act on those feelings at the time. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be overreacting if there's no prior pattern of the author being inconsiderate. Yet, relationships require communication and awareness. The author's comment about wanting to have a threesome with Annie, even as a joke, might have contributed to her insecurity. \n\nThe author is now considering how to handle his friendship with Annie, fearing it might change. He's torn between his girlfriend's feelings and his friendship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author didn't do anything malicious, but he might have lacked awareness of how his actions and past comments could be perceived. The girlfriend's perspective is that the situation was inappropriate, especially given the previous conversation. So, while he didn't intend harm, he might have been negligent in considering her feelings. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
