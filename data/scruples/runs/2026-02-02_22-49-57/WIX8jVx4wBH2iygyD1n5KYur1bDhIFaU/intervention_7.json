One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend (Annie) and not informing his girlfriend. The situation involves Annie falling asleep in his bed after a night of drinking and smoking. The girlfriend found out later and felt it was inappropriate, especially since they had previously joked about threesomes and he mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, the key points are: Annie came over, they had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The author didn't intend anything, just friendship. The girlfriend was upset because of the context (previous joking about threesomes) and Annie's past behavior (holding hands, etc.). The author didn't realize how this made her feel, even though he's faithful.\n\nNow, considering relationship boundaries. Even if the author didn't mean anything wrong, his girlfriend felt hurt and insecure. The fact that they had discussed threesomes jokingly might have made her feel like he was open to that, hence the sleepover with Annie could be seen as crossing a line. In relationships, communication is key. The author didn't ask his girlfriend, which could be seen as disregarding her feelings, even if unintentionally. Also, the girlfriend had valid concerns based on previous interactions with Annie. So, while the author didn't act with malice, he might be in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's perspective and not being mindful of boundaries she had mentioned.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend sleeping over wasn't intentional on his part. He didn't initiate anything, and they just fell asleep. The girlfriend's reaction might be overblown, especially if the author had no intention of being disrespectful. However, in relationships, it's about how the partner feels. The author's failure to check in with his girlfriend and his prior comments about Annie could have contributed to her feelings. So, maybe he isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both perspectives. But given the girlfriend's valid concerns and the context, the author might be in the wrong for not being more considerate of her feelings.\n"
