One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is at fault for having a sleepover with his friend Annie and not considering his girlfriend's feelings.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's friend Annie came over, they ended up watching TV in his room, smoked some weed, and fell asleep together. The author didn't inform his girlfriend, who was at a concert. The next day, he told her, but she was upset. She cited previous instances where Annie might have overstepped, like playing with his hair and holding his hand when his girlfriend was nearby. The girlfriend mentioned that the author hadn't done anything wrong in initiating, but he didn't notice how she felt. Also, there was a prior conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie, which might have given her the impression he was into that, hence why she felt hurt.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which is a red flag. Even if it was accidental, not communicating with his partner about such a situation is a problem. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she felt it was inappropriate and the prior joke about threesomes might have made her feel insecure. The author didn't consider her perspective, which is a common issue in relationships. \n\nAlso, the fact that Annie is in a long-term relationship herself might add another layer, but the main issue is the lack of communication from the author. He should have been more mindful of his girlfriend's feelings and discussed the boundaries beforehand. So, while he didn't act with malicious intent, his failure to communicate and consider her feelings makes him at least partially responsible. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
