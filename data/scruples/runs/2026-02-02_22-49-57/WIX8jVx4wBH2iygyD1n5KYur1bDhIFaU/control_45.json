One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a guy, had a sleepover with his female friend Annie in his room at the university. His girlfriend found out and got upset. The key points here are about boundaries in a relationship and communication.\n\nFirst, the author and Annie were at a party, but their friend bailed. They ended up watching TV in his room, smoked some weed, and fell asleep. The author's girlfriend wasn't there at the time but found out later. The author didn't think it was a big deal at first. But the girlfriend brought up past incidents where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand while the girlfriend was nearby. Also, there was a conversation where they jokingly discussed potential threesomes, and the author mentioned Annie. The girlfriend feels this made the sleepover situation worse.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let's break it down. In a relationship, there's an expectation of trust and communication. Even if the author didn't have intentions, the act of having a female friend sleep in his bed might be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if the girlfriend has expressed discomfort before. The author might not have realized the significance, but past behavior (like the hand-holding and the threesome joke) could contribute to the girlfriend's feelings of betrayal.\n\nAlso, the author didn't inform the girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be a point of contention. Even if it's just a sleepover, the lack of communication might be the issue. The girlfriend's reaction might be about accumulated trust issues, not just the sleepover itself. However, the author did correct the situation when the girlfriend brought it up, so he's not ignoring her feelings now.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author didn't have malicious intent and the act itself was innocent, maybe the girlfriend overreacted. But in relationships, how partners perceive actions matters a lot. The key is whether the author respected his girlfriend's boundaries. He might not have realized the boundaries, but the fact that there were previous instances of Annie overstepping and the author's own comment about threesomes could mean he wasn't as careful as he should have been.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not being mindful of his girlfriend's feelings and past concerns. He should have been more aware of the boundaries and communicated better. Even if unintentional, the actions still affected his girlfriend, which is important in maintaining trust and respect in a relationship.\n"
