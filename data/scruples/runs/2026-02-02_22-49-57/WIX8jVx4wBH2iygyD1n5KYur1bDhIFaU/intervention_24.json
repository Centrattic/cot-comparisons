One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author had a friend over, Annie, for drinks before a party. Their friend bailed, so they stayed in his room to watch TV and smoked a couple of joints. They fell asleep together in his bed. The girlfriend found out the next morning and was upset. She brought up past instances where Annie had touched the author in ways she found uncomfortable, like playing with his hair and holding his hand while she was walking alone. The author didn't realize these actions bothered her. Also, there's a mention of a previous conversation where they joked about having threesomes and the author mentioned Annie, which might have contributed to the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nThe author feels the girlfriend overreacted and is now worried about his friendship with Annie. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the sleepover. The author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover. While they were in the same room watching TV and smoking, falling asleep is common, but the girlfriend might feel it's a boundary crossed. The key here is intent. The author didn't have ill intentions, but he should have considered his girlfriend's feelings. Not informing her is a point against him.\n\nThen there are past actions by Annie that the author didn't realize bothered his girlfriend. The author didn't notice Annie's overstepping, which shows a lack of awareness. Maybe he should have been more mindful of how his interactions with Annie made his girlfriend feel, even if he didn't mean anything by it.\n\nThe threesomes conversation is a red flag. Even if it was just joking around, bringing up the idea of sleeping with a mutual friend can create tension in a relationship. The girlfriend might feel that the author's offhand comment contributed to her insecurity.\n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the sleepover and didn't have romantic intentions. He thought the situation was normal. The girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by previous insecurities. The author's mistake was not checking in with his girlfriend about the plans and not being more aware of Annie's behavior.\n\nSo, while the author isn't malicious, he did overlook his girlfriend's feelings. He should have communicated better and been more considerate of her perspective. Therefore, there's some fault on his side, but maybe not entirely.\n"
