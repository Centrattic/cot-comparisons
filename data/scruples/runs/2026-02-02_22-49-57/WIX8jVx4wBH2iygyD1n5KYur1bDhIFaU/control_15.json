One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the story) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a sleepover with a female friend while the author's girlfriend is out. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author and Annie, a close friend, both went to a party. When their plans changed, they ended up in the author's room watching TV, smoked, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend found out the next morning. The girlfriend was upset because she felt this was inappropriate, especially since they had previously joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie in that context.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the main issue here is about boundaries in a relationship. Even if the author didn't have any romantic intentions, the act of a friend sleeping in the same bed as their partner can be seen as crossing a line. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because in relationships, partners often have different boundaries. The author might not have intended to hurt her, but not considering her feelings shows a lack of awareness. \n\nAdditionally, the fact that they had joked about threesomes and mentioned Annie could have made the situation more sensitive. Even if it was just playful talk, the girlfriend might feel like that opens the door for such scenarios, making her uneasy. The author's failure to notice her discomfort in the past interactions (like Annie holding his hand) also plays a role here. \n\nThe author might not have done anything deliberately wrong, but the key point is not being considerate of the girlfriend's feelings and boundaries. Relationships require communication and respect for each other's comfort levels. The author's hyper-awareness now is a consequence of not addressing the girlfriend's concerns sooner. \n\nSo, while the author didn't act with malice, the lack of consideration for the girlfriend's perspective and boundaries makes him at least partially in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
