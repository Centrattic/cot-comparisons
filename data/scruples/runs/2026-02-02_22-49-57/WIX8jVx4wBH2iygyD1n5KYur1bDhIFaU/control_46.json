One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with his friend Annie and not informing his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and Annie, both in a college setting, had drinks, watched TV, smoked some weed, and fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. She mentioned previous instances where Annie seemed to overstep, like playing with his hair or holding his hand while the girlfriend was nearby. Also, there was a prior conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and communication. Even though the author didn't intend to do anything wrong, the girlfriend felt uncomfortable. The fact that they had previously discussed threesomes and he mentioned Annie might have subconsciously influenced her reaction. Also, in relationships, transparency is important. The author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a breach of trust, even if it was accidental.\n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate anything inappropriate. He and Annie just fell asleep. The girlfriend's reaction might be partly due to her own insecurities or past conversations. But the lack of communication from the author's side is a problem. Even if the situation was innocent, not discussing it with his girlfriend first could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the actions themselves (sleeping over) weren't malicious. On the other hand, not communicating with his girlfriend and not being aware of her feelings about Annie's behavior could be seen as neglecting her boundaries. The answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and not considering his girlfriend's perspective, even if unintentionally. But some might argue it's more about the girlfriend overreacting. But in relationships, communication is key, so the author's responsibility here is to have discussed the sleepover before it happened.\n"
