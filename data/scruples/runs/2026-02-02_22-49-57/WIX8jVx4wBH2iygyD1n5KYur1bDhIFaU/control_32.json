One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend without informing his girlfriend. The situation involves Annie, a 22F in a long-term relationship, staying over at the author's place. They had a sleepover after a party, and the author didn't think to ask his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. Even if the sleepover was innocent and accidental, not informing the girlfriend could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction is partly influenced by the previous conversation where the author mentioned having a threesome with Annie, even if it was just in a joking or hypothetical way. That might have planted some insecurities.\n\nThe girlfriend felt it was inappropriate and that the author wasn't aware of her feelings. The author didn't mean harm, but maybe didn't consider her perspective enough. The fact that Annie was in his bed and they were at a point where they were hyper-focused on each other (drugs, TV) might not be the issue, but the lack of transparency is. \n\nThe author is now worried about his friendship with Annie because he's hyper-aware and fears she might overstep. But the main issue here is the girlfriend's feelings. The author's actions, while not intentionally harmful, might have been careless regarding his girlfriend's emotions. The girlfriend's response is valid if she feels uncomfortable, especially given the past comments about threesomes. So, even if the author didn't do anything wrong in a strict sense, the lack of communication and consideration for her feelings makes him at least partially responsible. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
