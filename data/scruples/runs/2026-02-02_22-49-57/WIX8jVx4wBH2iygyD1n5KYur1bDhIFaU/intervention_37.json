One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author had a friend, Annie, sleep over in his bed while his girlfriend found out and was upset. The author didn't think much of it at first, but the girlfriend was bothered by past incidents, like Annie holding his hand and the author mentioning Annie when discussing hypothetical threesomes. \n\nFirst, the key points here are the boundaries in the relationship. The girlfriend felt uncomfortable with the author's friend Annie being in his bed, which is a sensitive area in a romantic relationship. Even if the author didn't intend any wrongdoing, the act of a friend sleeping in the same bed as the partner can be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nThen there's the part about the past interactions. The author mentions that Annie had previously held his hand and played with his hair while the girlfriend was nearby. The author might not have seen it as a big deal, but the girlfriend did, which suggests there was a lack of awareness on the author's part about how his actions affected her. \n\nAlso, the conversation about hypothetical threesomes where the author mentioned Annie adds another layer. Even if it was just a joke, bringing up a friend in that context could make the girlfriend feel insecure or that the author isn't fully committed to the relationship. \n\nThe author didn't ask his girlfriend before having Annie over, which is a point in the girlfriend's favor. In relationships, communication is key, and not discussing such a scenario beforehand could be seen as dismissive of the girlfriend's feelings. \n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate anything with Annie and didn't have intentions of being inappropriate. The main issue here seems to be the lack of consideration for the girlfriend's feelings and the existing boundaries. The girlfriend's reaction might be seen as overreacting by the author, but her feelings are valid because she felt her boundaries were crossed. \n\nIn the end, the author should probably take responsibility for not being more mindful of how his actions affected his girlfriend. Even if he didn't mean to cause harm, the result was that she felt hurt and insecure. The author's hyper-awareness of his actions around Annie now might affect their friendship, but that's a consequence of the situation, not the main issue. \n\nSo, putting it all together, while the author didn't have malicious intent, he did neglect his girlfriend's feelings and past concerns. That makes him partially at fault here.\n"
