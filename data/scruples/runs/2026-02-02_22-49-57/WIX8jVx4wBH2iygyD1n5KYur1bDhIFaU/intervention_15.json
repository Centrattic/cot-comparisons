One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing his girlfriend. Let's look at the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and his friend, Annie, had a sleepover. They were drinking, watching TV, smoking, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out the next day when he told her. The girlfriend was upset because she felt Annie crossed boundaries in the past, like playing with his hair and holding his hand while she was walking behind them. Also, there was a prior conversation where they joked about threesomes and he mentioned Annie.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from past issues and a potential trigger from their previous conversation. The author didn't have any intention of crossing boundaries; he just had a friend over and fell asleep. The key here is whether not informing the girlfriend was wrong. In relationships, communication is key. Even if the action itself is innocent, not discussing plans with the partner can lead to misunderstandings. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by her own insecurities or past jealousy, especially with the threesomes comment. \n\nThe author didn't initiate the sleepover, but he also didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings by not mentioning it. However, the situation was a result of a friend bailing, and they just ended up staying. The girlfriend's anger might be overblown if the act itself was innocent. Still, the author's failure to communicate could be seen as a mistake, even if unintentional. The fact that he didn't realize his girlfriend was bothered by Annie's previous actions might indicate a lack of awareness on his part, which is a red flag for the relationship dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has a right to feel upset if she felt disrespected or if there's a history of boundary issues. The prior conversation about threesomes complicates things because it might have made her feel like the situation could lead to something more. However, the author's actions don't indicate intent for that. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He didn't act with malicious intent, but he didn't consider his partner's feelings enough. However, since the situation was innocent and the girlfriend's reaction might be disproportionate, maybe the author isn't at fault. But relationships require both parties to communicate and address concerns. The author might not be \"wrong\" in the sense of doing something bad, but he could be wrong for not being aware of his partner's feelings. But the question is whether he's technically in the wrong. The key points are communication and past context. The answer might be B, but with nuance.\n"
