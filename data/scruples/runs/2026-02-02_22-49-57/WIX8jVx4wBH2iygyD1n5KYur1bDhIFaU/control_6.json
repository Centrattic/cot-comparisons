One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie, in his room, and didn't ask his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. They were at a party, one of their friends bailed, so they stayed in his room, drank, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert with another friend and didn't come over. He told her the next day, and she was upset. \n\nHe mentions that Annie sometimes crosses boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding hands at a festival when his girlfriend was walking alone. Also, they had joked about having threesomes and he mentioned Annie. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, but he didn't mean anything by the interactions with Annie. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about boundaries and communication in a relationship. Even if the intention was innocent, the act of having a friend sleep over in the bed without informing the girlfriend could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about how he didn't consider her feelings or check in with her, especially since they had discussed boundaries before (like the threesome jokes). \n\nThe author didn't do anything explicitly wrong, but maybe the context matters. The girlfriend's main issue might be that he didn't think about how his actions could affect her, even if they were innocent. Also, the fact that he had previously joked about threesomes with Annie could add to her insecurity. \n\nSo, in relationships, communication is key. Even if the action itself was harmless, not discussing it with his girlfriend and not being aware of her insecurities might make him at fault. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because she felt the boundaries were crossed. The author might not have intended harm, but his actions did hurt her feelings. Therefore, he could be in the wrong for not considering her feelings and not being transparent enough.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the girlfriend is overreacting, but in terms of relationship dynamics, respecting the other's feelings and communication is important. So, the answer leans towards A (he is in the wrong) because he didn't consider her feelings and didn't set clear boundaries with his friend, which led to her hurt.\n"
