One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author (a guy, 21) had a sleepover with his close female friend, Annie (22), who is in a long-term relationship. They had drinks, watched TV, smoked weed, and fell asleep together in his room. The girlfriend (20) found out the next day and was upset. She mentioned some other instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand at a festival while the girlfriend was behind. The author didn't think much of those before but now feels guilty because the girlfriend was hurt. The key point the girlfriend brought up was a previous conversation where they jokingly discussed threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. Now the author feels the girlfriend is overreacting and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, let's break down the dynamics. The main issue here is the girlfriend's feelings of being betrayed or not respected. Even if the author didn't have any intention, the act of having a close friend over, especially when the girlfriend was out, could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend might feel that the line between friendship and something more is being blurred, especially given the past conversation about threesomes involving Annie. \n\nThe author didn't initiate the sleepover, but he also didn't consider his girlfriend's perspective beforehand. Even if Annie initiated, the author allowed it to happen without checking in with his girlfriend. In a relationship, communication and mutual respect for boundaries are crucial. The girlfriend's reaction is partly about feeling that her partner is close to someone else in a way that might compete with their relationship.\n\nThe fact that they had previously discussed threesomes jokingly adds another layer. Even if it was just a joke, bringing up the idea of having a threesome with Annie might have planted a seed in the girlfriend's mind about the author's interest in her. When the sleepover happened, that past joke could have made the girlfriend feel that the situation was more than just innocent.\n\nThe author's response after being confronted is important too. He says he didn't do anything wrong because he didn't initiate it, but he also didn't notice her being bothered before. That shows a lack of awareness of her feelings and boundaries. In a healthy relationship, both partners should be mindful of each other's comfort levels, especially in social settings.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction might also be seen as overreaching. The author didn't have any intentions of cheating or disrespecting the relationship. The sleepover was with a friend who was also in a relationship. The main issue here is the combination of the sleepover and the previous joke about threesomes. The girlfriend's emotional response is valid because she's hurt, but whether she's right to be upset depends on how both parties view their relationship boundaries.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be at fault for not being considerate of his girlfriend's feelings when allowing Annie to sleep over, especially without discussing it with her. Even if Annie initiated, the author is responsible for managing his social interactions in a way that respects his partner's feelings. The girlfriend's concern about Annie's behavior (hand-holding, hair-playing) indicates that she felt uncomfortable with the closeness, which the author didn't notice before. This lack of awareness is a problem in the relationship communication.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" in a malicious sense. He didn't intentionally hurt his girlfriend. But relationships require mutual understanding and communication. The author should have considered his girlfriend's feelings before having a close friend stay over, especially given the past conversation about threesomes. The mistake wasn't in the sleepover itself but in not being aware of how it might affect his girlfriend and not setting boundaries to prevent such situations.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. He didn't act with ill intent, but he failed to consider his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries. Therefore, he shares some responsibility, but not entirely. However, in the context of a relationship, being considerate is key, and the author could have handled the situation better. The answer might be A (Yes) because he didn't take his girlfriend's feelings into account, but there's also a case for B (No) because there was no malicious intent. But given the standard expectations in relationships, the answer is likely A.\n"
