One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie, in his room, and didn't inform his girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset about it, especially since she mentioned in the past that if they ever had threesomes, she thought the author would choose Annie. Now she's upset that the situation with Annie sleeping over might have triggered some of her insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationships. The author's actions\u2014having a friend sleep over in his bed\u2014could be seen as crossing a boundary set by the girlfriend. Even if the author didn't intend anything inappropriate, not informing the girlfriend about the sleepover might be a breach of trust. Communication is key in relationships, so maybe the author should have checked in with his girlfriend before Annie came over.\n\nThen there's the history of joking about threesomes. Even if it was just for fun, the girlfriend is using that to highlight why the situation with Annie is problematic. The author might not have realized how his past comments affected her. Her reaction could be a mix of past insecurities and the current situation.\n\nThe author feels the situation was blown out of proportion, but the girlfriend is clearly hurt. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he didn't do anything intentionally harmful, but on the other, he didn't consider her feelings or communicate properly. In relationships, partners need to feel secure and respected. The author's lack of awareness of how his actions affected her could be seen as a failure to maintain that security.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to, he might be in the wrong for not being considerate of his girlfriend's feelings and for not communicating. The answer here would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because his actions, while not malicious, neglected his girlfriend's emotional needs and past concerns.\n"
