One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation involving a girlfriend and a friend. The key points here are about boundaries in a relationship and how communication plays a role.\n\nFirst, the author had a sleepover with a female friend, Annie, in his room. They ended up falling asleep together after party plans fell through. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and didn't come over. The next morning, he told her, and initially didn't see an issue. The girlfriend later confronted him, feeling it was inappropriate and brought up past instances where Annie's interactions with the author made her uncomfortable.\n\nThe girlfriend points out that the author had previously mentioned Annie in hypothetical threesome discussions, which adds context to why this situation upset her. The author now feels his girlfriend is overreacting and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, from a relationship standpoint, transparency and communication are crucial. Even if the author didn't intend to cross any boundaries, the fact that his actions (sleeping in the same bed with a friend) and past comments (about threesomes) made his girlfriend feel uncomfortable suggests that there's a breach of trust or unspoken boundaries.\n\nThe author might not have had malicious intent, but in relationships, it's important to consider how your actions affect your partner. Even if the behavior with Annie was innocent, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author should have been more aware of her potential discomfort, especially given the previous talk about threesomes. The author's lack of awareness of her feelings, even if unintentional, could be seen as a failure to maintain the trust and comfort the girlfriend expects.\n\nSo, while the author might not have done anything deliberately wrong, the situation does highlight a need for better communication and consideration of the girlfriend's feelings. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he failed to consider how his actions, even if innocent, affected his girlfriend's trust and comfort."
