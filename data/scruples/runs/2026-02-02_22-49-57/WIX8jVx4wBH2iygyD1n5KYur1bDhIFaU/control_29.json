One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me go through the details.\n\nThe author is a guy in a 2-year relationship with his girlfriend. He had a sleepover with his female friend Annie, who's in a long-term relationship. They both got drunk, watched TV in his room, smoked some weed, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, especially because there was a previous conversation where the author joked about having threesomes and mentioned Annie. The girlfriend felt this made the situation more inappropriate, even though the author didn't do anything on purpose. Now, the author is conflicted between his girlfriend's feelings and his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main issues are the sleepover and the prior comment about threesomes. The author didn't mean to hurt his girlfriend but maybe didn't consider her perspective. In relationships, transparency is important. Even if the act itself (falling asleep together) wasn't intentional, the girlfriend might feel it's a breach of trust. Also, the previous joke about threesomes involving Annie could have been a red flag. The girlfriend's reaction might be about feeling her boundaries were disrespected, even if the author didn't cross them intentionally.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? He didn't have relations with Annie, didn't intend to hurt his girlfriend, and he communicated the next day. However, he didn't consider how the sleepover might make his girlfriend feel, especially given the prior comments. He might be at fault for not being more mindful of her feelings and for not checking in with her before the sleepover. On the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction could be seen as overreacting, but her feelings are valid in the relationship context.\n\nThe key factors are communication and mutual respect of boundaries. The author might not have done anything illegal or malicious, but in a relationship, actions that could cause jealousy or insecurity matter. The previous joke about threesomes adds to the issue because it shows he considered the idea, which the girlfriend might find offensive. So, even if the author didn't mean harm, he should have been more aware of how his actions could affect his girlfriend. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't respect her boundaries and caused unnecessary hurt, even if unintentionally.\n"
