One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves him having a sleepover with his female friend Annie, who fell asleep in his bed. His girlfriend found out and was upset, especially because they had previously joked about threesomes and he mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author is in a two-year relationship, so trust and communication are key. The fact that the girlfriend felt the need to address this shows she had boundaries that were crossed, even if unintentionally. The author didn't plan for Annie to stay over, but he also didn't inform his girlfriend, which might be a problem. \n\nThe girlfriend brought up past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding hands. The author didn't realize these actions bothered her, which suggests a communication gap. However, the main issue here is the sleepover. While the author didn't initiate anything, the act of having a friend sleep in his bed could be seen as crossing a line, especially if the girlfriend feels it's a breach of trust. \n\nThe previous conversation about threesomes might have planted a seed of concern in the girlfriend's mind. Even if it was just a joke, the author's mention of Annie could have made the situation more sensitive. The girlfriend's reaction is valid if she felt insecure or that the boundaries were being tested. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't do anything intentionally wrong. He was with a friend, and it was a sleepover without any explicit misconduct. The girlfriend's anger might be overblown if there's no actual betrayal or intent. But in relationships, trust is subjective, and if one partner feels hurt or insecure, that's a valid feeling regardless of the action's severity.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. If the girlfriend's feelings are based on past jokes about threesomes and her own insecurities, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, not communicating with his girlfriend about the sleepover and being unaware of her discomfort with Annie's actions could make him partially responsible. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because he didn't act with malicious intent. But he could have been more aware of his girlfriend's feelings and communicated better. The key here is that both parties might have miscommunication and differing expectations. So the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
