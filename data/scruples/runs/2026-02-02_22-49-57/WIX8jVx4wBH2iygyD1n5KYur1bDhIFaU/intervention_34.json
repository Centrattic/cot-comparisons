One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again. The author, a guy, had his friend Annie stay over. They were hanging out, had drinks, smoked some weed, fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend found out and was upset. She mentioned that Annie had done other things like playing with his hair and holding hands at a festival when the girlfriend was alone. Also, there was a previous conversation where they joked about wanting to have threesomes and the author mentioned Annie.\n\nHmm, the core issue here is about boundaries in a relationship. The author didn't mean any harm, but the girlfriend felt hurt. Even if the actions themselves (like a friend sleeping over) aren't maliciously intended, the girlfriend's feelings matter. The fact that they'd previously joked about having threesomes with Annie might have made the situation more sensitive. The girlfriend probably felt that the author was being too casual about their boundaries, especially since he mentioned Annie in that context before. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, he didn't act with malicious intent, but he might not have been considerate enough of his girlfriend's feelings. In relationships, communication about boundaries is key. If the girlfriend had mentioned her discomfort before, the author might have been more aware. But since he didn't ask, maybe he's not entirely at fault. However, the fact that they discussed threesomes and he mentioned Annie could mean he didn't take her feelings into account enough. Maybe he should have been more aware of how his actions could be perceived, especially in light of that previous conversation.\n\nI think the main point is that the author didn't realize how his actions affected his girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she's hurt, even if the actions themselves weren't intended to be hurtful. So, while he's not in the wrong in a malicious sense, he might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings and the boundaries they should have discussed earlier. So, answer A: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
