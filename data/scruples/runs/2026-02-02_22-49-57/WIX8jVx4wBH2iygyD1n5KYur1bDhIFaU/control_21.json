One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's in a 2-year relationship, had a friend (Annie) over. They had drinks, watched TV in his room, smoked some weed, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend found out and was upset, especially because there was a prior conversation about threesomes and the author mentioning Annie. Now the author is wondering if they're in the wrong for feeling like the girlfriend overreacted and if their friendship with Annie is affected.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the author did something wrong. The author says they didn't do anything intentionally. They had a friend over, and they fell asleep. But the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate. The key factors here are communication and boundaries. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, the girlfriend's feelings matter in a relationship. The fact that the girlfriend brought up past instances where Annie crossed boundaries (like playing with hair, holding hands) shows that there were previous concerns. The author might not have noticed these, but in a committed relationship, it's important to be aware of your partner's feelings and boundaries, especially regarding other people. \n\nAlso, the prior conversation about threesomes and the author mentioning Annie probably made the girlfriend feel that the author was more open to that scenario with Annie, which could explain why this incident hurt her. The author's lack of awareness here might be a problem. Even if the action itself (sleeping in the same bed) was innocent, the context and the girlfriend's feelings make it a relationship issue. The author's responsibility is to communicate and respect their partner's boundaries, even if they don't see the problem themselves. So, while the author might not have intended to do anything wrong, they might be at fault for not considering their girlfriend's perspective and not being more proactive in maintaining boundaries to prevent such situations. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
