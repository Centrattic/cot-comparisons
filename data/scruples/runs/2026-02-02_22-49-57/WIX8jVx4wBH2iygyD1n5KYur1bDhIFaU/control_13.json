One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author (21M) had a sleepover with his friend Annie (22F) in his room, where they ended up falling asleep together. The girlfriend (20F) found out and was upset, especially because there was prior talk about threesomes and the author mentioning Annie. The author is now wondering if he's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship dynamics. The author and his girlfriend have been together for two years, which is a significant time. Communication is key in any relationship, especially regarding boundaries. The author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, which might be an issue if they hadn't discussed such situations before. Even if Annie is in a relationship and the author didn't initiate anything, the fact that they were in the same bed and he didn't mention it could be a breach of trust.\n\nThen there's the part where they discussed threesomes in a playful way, and the author mentioned Annie. That conversation might have planted a seed of insecurity in the girlfriend. Even if it was offhand, it's a sensitive topic, and bringing up specific names, especially of a friend, could be problematic. The girlfriend's reaction might be partly due to that past conversation, feeling that her partner's thoughts or fantasies involving someone else are a red flag.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend pointed out other instances where Annie overstepped, like playing with the author's hair and holding his hand at a festival. The author didn't notice these as issues, but maybe in the context of their relationship, those actions were making the girlfriend uncomfortable. It's possible that the girlfriend felt these actions were part of a pattern, and the sleepover was the last straw.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't plan the sleepover and even went back to his own place. He might not have intended to make his girlfriend feel insecure. The key here is whether the author's actions, even if unintended, crossed the boundaries that the girlfriend expected. If the girlfriend had previously expressed discomfort or set boundaries about physical interactions with friends, then the author might have been in the wrong by not being more considerate.\n\nBut since the author didn't initiate the physical contact and the sleepover was accidental, maybe he isn't entirely at fault. However, the failure to communicate about the sleepover and the prior mention of Annie in a threesome context could contribute to the girlfriend's feelings of being disregarded. The author might need to consider how his actions and words affect his girlfriend's emotions and trust, even if he didn't mean anything by them.\n\nSo, taking all this into account, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and the prior conversation about threesomes involving Annie. But if the girlfriend's reaction was disproportionate given that no actual boundary was crossed (since Annie is in a relationship and the author didn't act on his previous comment), it could be B (not in the wrong). The question is about whether the author's actions were inappropriate, and while the sleepover itself was accidental, the context of the previous discussion might have made the girlfriend's reaction justified. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being more aware of his girlfriend's feelings and for the prior offhand comments.\n"
