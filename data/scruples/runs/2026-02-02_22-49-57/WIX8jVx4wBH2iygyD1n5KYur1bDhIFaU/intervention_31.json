One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The author is a guy in a two-year relationship who had a sleepover with his female friend. The friend came over to hang out, they ended up not going to the party, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep together in his room. The girlfriend found out the next day and later brought up concerns about the appropriateness of the situation. She also mentioned past instances where the friend played with his hair and held his hand, which might have made her uncomfortable. The author feels the situation was blown out of proportion, especially since they had previously joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie, which the girlfriend now cites as a reason for her feelings.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the sleepover. The author didn't ask his girlfriend, but he might have thought it was casual. However, in a relationship, especially with a two-year history, communication is key. Even if the intention was innocent, not consulting with his girlfriend could be seen as neglecting her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction includes past behaviors that the author didn't realize were bothering her, which shows a lack of attention to her emotional state. \n\nThe author's previous joke about threesomes with Annie might have given the girlfriend a reason to feel uneasy now. Even if it was just a joke, it could imply boundaries were being tested. The fact that the girlfriend felt the need to confront him about not noticing her discomfort is a sign that the author might not have been as attentive as he should have been. \n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective, her reaction could be influenced by the past conversation. She might have felt that the author's casual mention of a threesome in the past made the recent sleepover a trigger for her. The author's statement that he \"thought nothing of it for the next few days\" might indicate he wasn't aware of her feelings, but in a committed relationship, partners often expect updates and care about their partner's emotional well-being. \n\nThe author is now worried about his friendship with Annie. If the girlfriend feels hurt, it's important for the author to address her concerns and maybe adjust how he interacts with Annie to respect her feelings. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: not informing the girlfriend, the girlfriend's valid concerns about past interactions, and the impact on their relationship. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, could be seen as inconsiderate if he didn't realize the potential for discomfort he was causing his partner. The girlfriend's reaction, while possibly intense, is a valid expression of her feelings. So, while the author didn't act with bad intent, he might be in the wrong for not being more considerate of his girlfriend's perspective and for not maintaining open communication about boundaries with friends of the opposite sex.\n"
