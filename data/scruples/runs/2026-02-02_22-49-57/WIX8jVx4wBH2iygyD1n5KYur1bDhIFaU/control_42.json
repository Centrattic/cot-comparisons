One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is at fault. The scenario involves a man (21M) who had a sleepover with his female friend (22F) in his room, and his girlfriend (20F) found out. The key points here are the setup of the situation and the girlfriend's reactions.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his friend Annie came over for drinks before a party. They ended up watching TV, smoking, and fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend wasn't present and the author didn't inform her. The girlfriend later confronted him, pointing out that Annie's actions (like playing with his hair and holding his hand at a festival) made her uncomfortable. Also, the author once mentioned in a joke conversation that he would have a threesome with Annie, which the girlfriend took as a red flag.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms and boundaries. In most relationships, partners expect some level of exclusivity and communication. The author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the intentions were innocent, not checking in with his girlfriend might be seen as neglecting her feelings, especially since they had discussed such topics before. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction could be based on past jokes about threesomes involving Annie, which might have planted a seed of insecurity. The fact that the author didn't realize how his actions affected her suggests a lack of awareness of her feelings. Even if the actions themselves were innocent, the context of previous conversations and the girlfriend's sensitivity to Annie's behavior could justify her feelings of betrayal or insecurity.\n\nSo, while the author may not have intended to cross any lines, the lack of communication and the context of their past discussions could place some responsibility on him. The core issue here is about maintaining open communication and respecting the partner's feelings about boundaries, which the author may have failed to do.\n"
