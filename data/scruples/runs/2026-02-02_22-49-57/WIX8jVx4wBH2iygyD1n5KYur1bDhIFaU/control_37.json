One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The key points are: the author had a sleepover with a female friend in his room, the girlfriend found out and felt it was inappropriate, especially because the author had mentioned wanting to have a threesome with Annie before. \n\nFirst, the setup. The author and his friend Annie were at a party, their friend bailed, so they went back to his room to watch TV and smoked. They fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend. The next day, the author told the girlfriend that Annie slept in his bed. The girlfriend was upset, pointing out past incidents where Annie was overly affectionate. The author didn't realize these made her uncomfortable. Also, the girlfriend was upset because the author had mentioned wanting a threesome with Annie in the past.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is the girlfriend's feelings being hurt. Even if the author didn't intend anything inappropriate, the situation could be seen as giving the wrong impression. Sharing a bed with a friend of the opposite sex, especially in a romantic relationship, might be a boundary issue. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her partner's actions were crossing lines, even if unintentionally. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned in the past that his ideal threesome partner would be Annie. Even if it was just playful, bringing that up might have contributed to the girlfriend's insecurity. The author didn't consider how his actions and past comments could affect his girlfriend's feelings, which is part of being in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate anything, and they fell asleep together. It's possible the girlfriend overreacted, especially if there's no history of similar issues. But in relationships, communication and respecting each other's boundaries are crucial. The author might have been negligent in considering his girlfriend's perspective, especially after she had already expressed concerns about Annie's behavior before.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended harm, the fact that he didn't acknowledge his girlfriend's previous discomfort and the context of his past comments about Annie being a potential third person in a relationship suggests that he might be in the wrong. The responsibility in a relationship includes being aware of how your actions affect your partner, even if you think they're minor.\n"
