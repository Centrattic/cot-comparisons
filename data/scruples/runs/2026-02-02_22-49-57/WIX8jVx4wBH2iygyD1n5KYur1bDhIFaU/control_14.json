One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author had a sleepover with his female friend Annie, who's in a long-term relationship, without telling his girlfriend. They ended up falling asleep together in his bed. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, especially because they had previously joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover. Even though they had talked about threesomes jokingly, the girlfriend felt uncomfortable because those discussions might have implied consent or openness to that scenario. The fact that Annie is in a relationship might add another layer here, but the main issue is the lack of communication. \n\nWhen a partner feels that their comfort or boundaries are being crossed, even if the actions themselves (like a friend sleeping over) are innocent, not discussing it can be a problem. The girlfriend was upset not just because of the sleepover but also because the author had mentioned Annie in the context of threesomes. That connection is important. The author's argument is that he didn't mean anything by it, but the girlfriend's reaction is valid because her feelings were hurt. \n\nAlso, the author is now hyper-aware of his actions around Annie, fearing it might affect their friendship. But the core question is whether he was in the wrong. Since he didn't communicate with his girlfriend about the sleepover, even if it was accidental, and didn't consider her feelings in the context of their prior conversations, it seems like he made a mistake. The girlfriend's reaction might be seen as over the top, but her feelings are legitimate. The author should have been more considerate and informed her beforehand to avoid misunderstandings. \n\nSo, the answer would be A, meaning the author is in the wrong, because not discussing the sleepover with his girlfriend and the prior comments about threesomes contributed to her discomfort, even if his intentions were innocent.\n"
