One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a male friend and not informing the girlfriend. The situation involves the author and their friend Annie falling asleep together in his room after a party. The girlfriend was upset about this and mentioned previous instances where Annie crossed boundaries. The author feels the girlfriend overreacted, especially since he didn't initiate the sleepover and they had discussed hypothetical threesomes before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The girlfriend felt uncomfortable because of past boundaries crossed and the recent sleepover. Even if the author didn't intend anything wrong, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. In relationships, communication is key. The author didn't consult his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the girlfriend had previously expressed discomfort with Annie's behavior.\n\nAlso, the fact that they had a conversation about hypothetical threesomes adds context. The girlfriend might feel that the author's previous offhand comments influenced her reaction. Even if the author didn't have ill intentions, not considering how his actions affect his girlfriend's feelings is problematic.\n\nThe author's argument is that he didn't do anything wrong because he didn't initiate the situation. But in a relationship, both partners need to be on the same page regarding boundaries with friends. The author's lack of awareness about the girlfriend's feelings and not checking in with her before the sleepover could be seen as negligence.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction might be over the top if the author had no intention of being inappropriate. However, the key issue here is the lack of communication and the girlfriend's justified concerns based on past behavior. The author is now feeling conflicted about his friendship with Annie because of the girlfriend's reaction, which complicates things further.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author didn't act with malice, the fact that he didn't communicate with his girlfriend and disregarded her previous concerns about Annie's boundaries might place some responsibility on him. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
