One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend and not informing his girlfriend. The situation involves his friend Annie falling asleep in his bed after a party. The girlfriend is upset because of past comments about threesomes involving Annie.\n\nFirst, the author didn't plan to have Annie over; it was spontaneous. They were at a party, friends bailed, so they stayed in to relax. The key points here are that the author didn't initiate the sleepover and that Annie is in a relationship herself. The girlfriend was at a concert, so she wasn't around. \n\nThe girlfriend's main issue seems to be about the boundary crossing, especially with past jokes about threesomes. The author mentions he hadn't noticed her being bothered before. Now, he's feeling guilty and hyper-aware of his interactions with Annie, which is affecting his friendship. \n\nI need to consider if the author is at fault. Not informing the girlfriend about the sleepover could be a point of contention, but the situation happened without planning. However, in a relationship, communication is key. Even if it was unplanned, the act of a friend sleeping in the bed might be something the girlfriend would expect to be informed about. But the author did tell her the next day, so maybe the timing isn't the issue. \n\nThe bigger issue seems to be the past conversation about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie. That joke might have led the girlfriend to feel insecure. Even if it was meant in a playful way, it can be hurtful when taken seriously. The author's lack of awareness about his girlfriend's feelings is a problem here. He didn't realize that this past comment was contributing to her current upset.\n\nSo, while the sleepover itself was uneventful and not planned, the underlying issue of the threesome conversation and the author's insensitivity to his girlfriend's feelings might make him partially at fault. However, he didn't initiate the situation and didn't have intent to hurt her. The answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong (B), but there's a nuance here. The main conflict is about communication and past jokes affecting current feelings.\n"
