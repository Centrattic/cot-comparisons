One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a close female friend and not informing his girlfriend. The situation involves the author's friend, Annie, staying over after a party plan fell through. They ended up watching TV, smoking, and falling asleep in his room. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, especially because the author had joked about having threesomes with Annie in the past.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The girlfriend is 20, the author is 21, and Annie is 22. The author thought it was a casual sleepover but didn't consider how his girlfriend might feel. The girlfriend cited past incidents where Annie was affectionate, which the author hadn't noticed. The key points here are communication and boundaries.\n\nThe author didn't ask his girlfriend, which is a problem. Even if he thought it was innocent, not discussing it with her shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. Trust and communication are crucial in relationships. The girlfriend had valid concerns, especially with the past conversation about threesomes involving Annie. The author's not noticing her discomfort indicates he might not have been attentive enough.\n\nHowever, the author didn't intend anything wrong. He might not have realized the impact of his actions. But the issue here is about the girlfriend's feelings and the lack of communication. The author's hyper-awareness now suggests he's trying to adjust, but the initial oversight is a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction could be seen as overblown if there's no prior history of similar issues. But given the threesome joke, her reaction is understandable. The author's actions, while not malicious, did cross a line by not involving his girlfriend in the decision and by not recognizing her discomfort in past interactions with Annie.\n\nSo, the author is not entirely in the wrong because he didn't intend harm. However, he did make a mistake in not communicating and not being aware of his girlfriend's feelings. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for the oversight even if he didn't mean to hurt her."
