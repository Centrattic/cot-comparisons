One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend without informing his girlfriend. The situation involves the friend falling asleep in his bed after drinking and smoking, which the girlfriend found out later and was upset about.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's main issues are that the sleepover happened without her knowledge and that the friend, Annie, had previously crossed boundaries, which the author didn't notice. The author mentions that he didn't initiate any of it and that he thought nothing of it initially. However, the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, especially considering a past conversation about potential threesomes, which might have made her feel insecure.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective, even if the author didn't have bad intentions, not discussing the sleepover with her could be seen as a lack of communication. In relationships, transparency is key. The fact that they had talked about threesomes in a joking manner might have made the situation more sensitive for her. The author not anticipating how this would affect her could be a point against him.\n\nHowever, the author didn't do anything intentionally wrong. He had a friend over, they had a night in, and fell asleep. The main issue is the lack of communication. The author might not be in the wrong, but he should have considered his girlfriend's feelings and informed her. The girlfriend's reaction, while perhaps overblown, is valid in terms of her emotional response. \n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author's mistake was not communicating with his girlfriend about the plans. But he didn't act with malice. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because the actions themselves weren't malicious, but the lack of communication is a relationship issue. However, cultural or personal values might differ on what's acceptable. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the author's intentions are good, so B seems right.\n"
