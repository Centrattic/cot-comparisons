One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a close male friend where they both fell asleep in the same bed without informing his girlfriend. The girlfriend was upset about this and mentioned past instances where the friend might have overstepped, like holding hands or playing with hair. The author didn't realize these things bothered the girlfriend until she brought it up. Also, there was a prior joke about threesomes where the author mentioned the friend, which seems to have contributed to the girlfriend's discomfort.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the sleepover. Even if they didn't do anything inappropriate, sharing a bed with a friend of the opposite sex can be a sensitive topic in a relationship. The author didn't inform his girlfriend, which could be seen as a lack of communication. However, he didn't intend any wrongdoing. The girlfriend was upset because of past behavior she felt was crossing boundaries, which the author didn't realize were a problem.\n\nThe girlfriend did acknowledge that the author didn't initiate anything, so he might not be at fault for the sleepover itself. However, the fact that he had mentioned the friend in a hypothetical threesome conversation earlier might have planted seeds of doubt in the girlfriend's mind. Even if it was a joke, bringing up such topics can lead to insecurity.\n\nThe author is now feeling hyper-aware and worried about his friendship with Annie. The question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he didn't do anything intentionally harmful. On the other, the situation could be seen as a lack of consideration for his girlfriend's feelings, especially given the past jokes. But since he didn't act on the hypothetical scenario, maybe he's not entirely at fault. It's more about communication and the girlfriend's feelings being valid. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he didn't intend harm, but there's room for argument about transparency.\n"
