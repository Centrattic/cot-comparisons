One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author's girlfriend being upset about a sleepover with a female friend in the author's bed, and the author feeling that the girlfriend overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a friend, Annie, who came over, they had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend found out and is upset, partly because there was a previous conversation about considering threesomes and Annie being the suggested person. The author didn't think much of it initially but now feels hyper-aware and concerned about his friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, sleeping in the same bed as a friend, especially when the girlfriend isn't around, could be seen as a boundary issue. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling insecure or hurt. Even if the author didn't intend anything inappropriate, not considering his girlfriend's feelings and not communicating the situation when he found out about the sleepover could be a problem. Also, the fact that there was prior discussion about threesomes involving Annie might have made the girlfriend feel that the sleepover was a step closer to that, even if it wasn't intentional.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the situation was innocent, and the girlfriend overreacted. However, in relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The author should have been more mindful of his girlfriend's feelings and perhaps avoided situations that could be misinterpreted, especially when there were previous discussions about boundaries.\n\nTherefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because he didn't consider his girlfriend's potential feelings, even if there was no malicious intent. He should have communicated better and been more aware of her sensitivities.\n"
