One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not involving their girlfriend. The situation is that Annie, a friend who's in a relationship, came over for drinks and ended up falling asleep in the author's bed. The girlfriend found out and was upset, mentioning past instances where Annie had touched the author in ways she didn't like, like playing with his hair and holding his hand. Also, the author had mentioned Annie in a hypothetical threesome discussion, which the girlfriend found hurtful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship dynamics. The author is in a two-year relationship, so trust and communication are important. Even though the sleepover was accidental, the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling neglected and that boundaries were crossed. The key here is that the author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a lack of transparency. \n\nThe girlfriend brought up past behaviors that the author hadn't noticed were a problem. This suggests that there might have been a pattern the author overlooked, possibly leading to the girlfriend's discomfort. The hypothetical threesome conversation adds another layer. Even if it was joking, mentioning someone else in a sexual context could be a trigger for the girlfriend, making her feel insecure or unappreciated.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the main issues are not informing the girlfriend about the sleepover and the past comments. While the sleepover itself didn't involve anything inappropriate, the lack of communication could be a problem. The girlfriend's feelings are valid if she feels that those actions, even unintentional, have implications on their trust. Also, the author's previous offhand comments about threesomes with Annie might have contributed to her feeling that he's not fully committed. \n\nHowever, the author claims he didn't initiate anything and didn't realize his girlfriend was bothered by previous interactions. That could mean he's not intentionally inconsiderate. But in a relationship, partners often need to set boundaries and communicate their discomforts. The author might be at fault for not being attentive to her feelings in the past and not discussing the sleepover promptly. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction might be overblown, especially if the author had no intention of being inappropriate. But relationships are about mutual respect and understanding. The fact that he had mentioned Annie in a sexual context, even hypothetically, might have given her the impression that he sees Annie in a different light. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate the sleepover and his past comments could have caused her distress. But it's a nuanced situation where both parties might have valid points. However, the main question is about the author's actions. Not being aware of her feelings doesn't exonerate him if those actions (like the sleepover and previous comments) led to her discomfort. He should have been more considerate and communicated better. So probably A.\n"
