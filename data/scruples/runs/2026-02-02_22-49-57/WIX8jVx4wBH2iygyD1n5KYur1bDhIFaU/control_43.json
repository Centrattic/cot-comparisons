One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy in a two-year relationship with his girlfriend. He has a close female friend named Annie, who is in a long-term relationship herself. One night, Annie comes over for drinks before a party. They end up not going to the party and instead hang out in his room, watching TV and smoking. They fall asleep together in his bed. The author didn't tell his girlfriend about this until the next morning. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and didn't come over. \n\nLater, the girlfriend confronts him, saying the situation was inappropriate. She brings up past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand while she was walking alone. The author didn't realize these made her uncomfortable. The key point she mentions is a previous conversation where they joked about having threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. Now, the girlfriend is upset, and the author feels she blew it out of proportion, affecting his friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend is upset because of the sleepover and past boundary-crossing by Annie, and the author feels it's overblown.\n\nFirst, let me consider the girlfriend's perspective. In relationships, trust and communication are crucial. Even if the author didn't intend anything inappropriate, the act of a friend sleeping in his bed could be seen as a boundary issue. The girlfriend is in a two-year relationship, so she might feel jealous or insecure. The fact that they had joked about threesomes and he mentioned Annie could have planted seeds of doubt. Even if they were just joking, the girlfriend might take it seriously now. \n\nFrom the author's side, he didn't initiate the sleepover but didn't think it was a big deal. He was honest with his girlfriend the next day, and it's unclear if there was any intention to deceive. He also values his friendship with Annie and feels that the girlfriend is overreacting. He didn't notice the previous boundary issues, which might indicate he's not fully attuned to her feelings, but does that make him wrong?\n\nNow, thinking about the situation: sleeping in the same bed is a common thing among friends, but in a relationship, it can be misinterpreted, especially if one partner is uncomfortable. The author's girlfriend's reaction is valid because in relationships, partners often expect each other to avoid situations that could cause jealousy or insecurity. The author didn't consider her feelings when having Annie over, even if it was a mistake. Also, the past jokes about threesomes with Annie likely contributed to the current issue, making the girlfriend more sensitive.\n\nThe author's responsibility is to respect his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries. Even if he didn't mean to cross them, he should have been more mindful of how his actions could affect her. He didn't ask her about the sleepover, which is a breach of communication. In a relationship, partners should discuss plans that involve other people, especially when it's a close friend. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction might be considered over the top if there's no actual infidelity or intention to harm the relationship. The author was honest and didn't have malicious intent. The previous jokes about threesomes might have been in a context where they were just discussing fantasies, not actual plans. \n\nBut in relationships, partners have the right to express their boundaries and expect them to be respected. The author didn't consider how the sleepover could affect his girlfriend's trust, especially with a friend who has a history of crossing boundaries. The fact that he didn't notice these past issues might indicate a lack of awareness of her feelings, which is a problem in communication and empathy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because there was no malicious intent, but he did fail to consider his girlfriend's feelings and didn't communicate properly. The girlfriend's reaction is valid due to her insecurity and the context of their previous conversations. However, the author could have handled the situation better by being more considerate and discussing the sleepover with her beforehand. \n\nBut the question is whether he is in the wrong. In terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at whether the person made a mistake that's unreasonable. The author's mistake was not considering his girlfriend's boundaries and past concerns, leading to her feeling hurt. Even if unintentional, it's a failure to respect her feelings. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he should have been more mindful and communicated better. However, some might argue it's a misunderstanding rather than the author being wrong. But given the context of the previous jokes and the girlfriend's legitimate concerns about boundaries, the author's actions did contribute to the problem. So the answer is A.\n"
