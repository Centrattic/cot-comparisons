One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is about a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie, who ended up falling asleep in his bed. The girlfriend found out and was upset, especially because they had previously joked about threesomes and the guy had mentioned Annie in that context. The author feels the girlfriend is overreacting and is worried about how this will affect his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationships. The author and Annie were already friends, and he didn't initiate the sleepover. They had a few drinks, smoked, and fell asleep. The key points here are that the sleepover wasn't planned, it was a casual situation, and he didn't do anything intentionally to make his girlfriend uncomfortable. However, the girlfriend's reaction is tied to previous conversations where they joked about threesomes, which might have created some expectations or boundaries that were unspoken.\n\nThe main issue is whether just having a friend over and falling asleep is wrong. In many relationships, even if there's no romantic or sexual activity, a friend of the opposite sex sleeping in the bed can be a sensitive topic. The girlfriend's upset might stem from feeling that the author's choice of mentioning Annie in the context of threesomes could imply a level of comfort or closeness that crosses her personal boundaries. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, his actions (not asking his girlfriend about the sleepover, the prior joking about threesomes) might have contributed to her feeling neglected or insecure.\n\nThen there's the part where the author didn't realize that his actions were bothering her. That could be a communication problem. Relationships require open dialogue about boundaries and what is acceptable. If they had discussed this before, maybe the author should have been more careful. However, the sleepover itself wasn't intentional; it was a result of their friend bailing and not wanting to go alone. So the author didn't plan it, but the fact that he didn't mention it to his girlfriend immediately after suggests a lack of awareness of her feelings, which is important.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be seen as overblown if there were no explicit boundaries against friends sleeping over. But if the prior discussion about threesomes included Annie, even humorously, the girlfriend might feel that this friendship has a potential for more than just platonic, which could be a source of insecurity. The author didn't do anything that was explicitly wrong, but he might have failed to consider how his actions and previous words could affect his girlfriend, even if unintentionally.\n\nOn the other hand, as a friend, Annie was in a situation where she ended up sleeping in the same bed, which could be a normal occurrence among friends. The author didn't engage in any inappropriate behavior, so he might not be in the wrong. But the problem is more about the girlfriend's feelings and how the author handled the communication. The fact that the author didn't consider her perspective could be a point of failure in the relationship.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author should have been more mindful of his girlfriend's feelings given the prior discussions. If the girlfriend felt that the mention of Annie in the context of threesomes made the sleepover situation more charged, then the author might have been in the wrong for not being more careful. But if there were no clear boundaries and the sleepover was a one-time, innocent occurrence, then maybe not. The key is the lack of communication and consideration of the girlfriend's potential discomfort, even if the actions themselves weren't malicious.\n"
