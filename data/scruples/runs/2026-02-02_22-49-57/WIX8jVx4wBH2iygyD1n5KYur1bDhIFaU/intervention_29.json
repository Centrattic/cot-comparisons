One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author had a sleepover with a female friend in his room, and his girlfriend got upset because of that and some past interactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and his friend, Annie, were hanging out, ended up in his room, fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend. The author didn't inform his girlfriend, which could be a point of contention. Also, the girlfriend mentioned past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like holding his hand and playing with his hair. \n\nThe key issue here is about boundaries in a relationship. Even if the author didn't have any intentions, the fact that he didn't communicate with his girlfriend about the sleepover could be a problem. Relationships often rely on open communication. The girlfriend was upset because she felt these boundaries were crossed, especially after the author previously mentioned Annie in the context of threesomes, even if jokingly. \n\nThe author might not think he did anything wrong because he didn't intend to hurt his girlfriend, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Trust and communication are crucial. By not informing his girlfriend about the sleepover and being unaware of her discomfort with Annie's behavior, he may have inadvertently caused her distress. \n\nSo, while the author might not have malicious intent, he could be at fault for not considering his girlfriend's feelings and not maintaining clear boundaries. The answer might lean towards A (Yes), but I need to check if the responsibility lies more with the author for not communicating or if the girlfriend overreacted.\n"
