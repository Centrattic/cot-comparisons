One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author, a guy, had a sleepover with his female friend Annie, who is 22 and in a long-term relationship. The girlfriend found out later and got upset. The key points here are the sleepover and the previous conversation about threesomes.\n\nFirst, the sleepover: The author and Annie were in his room, watching TV, smoked some weed, and fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and didn't come over. The author tells her the next morning but doesn't think much of it. The girlfriend later brings up that Annie crossed boundaries before, like playing with his hair and holding his hand at a festival. She didn't find out about the sleepover until after this. \n\nThe main issue here is whether the author did something wrong by having Annie over. The girlfriend is upset because they had a previous conversation about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie. Even though they were joking, it seems like that planted a seed in the girlfriend's mind. The author didn't notice that these interactions were bothering her before, but now he's hyper-aware and worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't initiate the sleepover, but he did have a female friend over in his room when his girlfriend wasn't there. Even if they were just sleeping and there's no physical relationship, it can still feel like a betrayal if the girlfriend is uncomfortable with it. The fact that they had discussed threesomes in a playful way, and the author mentioned Annie, might have made the girlfriend feel that there's a possibility of something happening, even if he didn't mean it seriously. \n\nAlso, the author didn't consider how his actions might affect the girlfriend's feelings, even if he didn't have malicious intent. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be based on her feelings of insecurity, which the author could have addressed more carefully. By not being attentive to her previous discomforts and then proceeding with the sleepover, he might have contributed to her anxiety. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be overreacting, especially since the author and Annie fell asleep without any apparent romantic intentions. However, in a relationship, communication and considering each other's feelings is crucial. The author should have been more aware of his girlfriend's perspective, especially after she had already mentioned previous boundary issues. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't take into account his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries, even if he didn't have ill intent. His actions, while not initiating anything, could be seen as careless in how they affect the girlfriend's trust and comfort.\n"
