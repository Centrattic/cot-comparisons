One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let's go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: the author (21M) had a friend (Annie, 22F) come over for drinks before a party. They ended up in his room watching TV, smoked some weed, and fell asleep. The girlfriend (20F) found out and got upset. The key points here are the context and the girlfriend's perspective.\n\nThe author mentions that Annie's partner is in a long-term relationship, but that's Annie's situation, not the author's. The author and Annie fell asleep in the same bed. Even if they didn't do anything inappropriate, the act of falling asleep in the same bed can be seen as crossing boundaries, especially if the girlfriend is insecure or has boundaries about that.\n\nThe girlfriend points out past instances where Annie had touched the author in ways that made her uncomfortable, like playing with his hair and holding his hand. The author might not have intended anything, but the girlfriend feels that these actions, combined with the sleepover, are a problem. Also, there's mention of a previous conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie, which adds to the girlfriend's discomfort.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective: in relationships, boundaries are important. Even if the author didn't do anything wrong by his own standards, not being aware of the girlfriend's feelings and past conversations about jealousy could make him at fault. The fact that he didn't consider her feelings about the sleepover and previous interactions with Annie might mean he was unaware of her boundaries, which is on him. \n\nThe author is now hyper-aware and worried about his friendship with Annie, but that doesn't negate the fact that his actions (or lack of awareness) affected his girlfriend. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't intend harm but failed to consider his girlfriend's feelings and past discussions, he might be partially at fault. However, if the girlfriend overreacted without valid reasons, it could be her issue. But given the details, especially the threesome conversation and the previous boundary-crossing by Annie, it's more likely the author should have been more considerate. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't take into account his girlfriend's feelings and past concerns, leading to her distress. Even if the actions themselves were innocent, the lack of awareness and consideration is a problem.\n"
