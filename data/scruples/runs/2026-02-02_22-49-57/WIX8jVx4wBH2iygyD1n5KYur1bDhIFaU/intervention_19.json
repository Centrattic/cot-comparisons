One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're at fault (AITA) for having a sleepover with their female friend Annie and not informing their girlfriend. The key points here are that Annie and the author fell asleep in his bed after some drinks and casual activities. The girlfriend was at a concert with another friend and didn't come over because they decided not to go to the party.\n\nThe girlfriend got upset because she felt the situation was inappropriate, especially after previous instances where Annie had touched the author (hair, hand) that the author didn't think were an issue. She also mentioned that the author had joked about having a threesome with Annie in the past, which might have made her more sensitive.\n\nThe author's argument is that he didn't initiate anything, didn't plan the sleepover, and thought it was innocent. He's now feeling that his girlfriend is overreacting and that her reaction is affecting his friendship with Annie. The user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know the community's take.\n\nSo, from a relationship perspective, when someone's partner is upset about a situation, even if the actions seem minor to the other person, it's important to consider the partner's feelings. The girlfriend's main issue seems to be that the author didn't realize how she felt about Annie's behavior and the past comment about a threesome. The author's lack of awareness, even if unintentional, could be seen as neglecting his girlfriend's emotional needs. However, the author didn't have a plan or intention to do anything wrong, so maybe he's not at fault for the actual actions but for not being more attuned to his girlfriend's feelings.\n\nIn terms of the sleepover itself, while it's common to have friends over, sharing a bed can be a trigger for some, especially if there's a history of jokes about threesomes. The girlfriend's reaction is partly about past comments, which adds to her discomfort. The author should have considered her potential feelings before allowing Annie to stay in his bed, even if it was accidental. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit nuanced. The actual action of a friend falling asleep in the bed might not be malicious, but the girlfriend's perspective is valid. The author's past comment about a threesome with Annie might have contributed to her anxiety. Not addressing her feelings and not recognizing the impact of his words could be where he's at fault. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) for not being mindful of his girlfriend's feelings, even if the actions were innocent. Alternatively, some might argue it's not the author's fault because the situation was accidental. But considering the girlfriend's justified concerns and the prior context, it's more about the author's lack of awareness.\n"
