One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The author, a guy in a two-year relationship, had his friend Annie (who's in a relationship too) come over for drinks and they ended up falling asleep in his bed. The girlfriend found out and was upset, citing that the author hadn't noticed her discomfort before, especially after a previous conversation where they joked about threesomes and he mentioned Annie. The author feels the GF blew it out of proportion and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author did something wrong. The main issues here are the sleepover and not being aware of the girlfriend's feelings. In some relationships, sharing a bed with a friend of the opposite sex, especially when both are in relationships, can be a red flag. The girlfriend was clearly upset because she felt her boundaries were crossed, even if the author didn't intend to cross them. \n\nThe key points: The author didn't initiate the sleepover, but he also didn't consider the girlfriend's feelings when Annie was there. He might not have been aware, but the girlfriend's reaction shows that this was a deal-breaker for her. Additionally, the previous joke about threesomes involving Annie likely made the situation more sensitive. Even if the author didn't mean anything by the previous comments, bringing up Annie in that context probably added fuel to the fire.\n\nThe author's mistake wasn't just the sleepover but also not recognizing the girlfriend's discomfort in other instances (like Annie playing with his hair and holding his hand). The girlfriend felt that these actions were overstepping, and the author didn't notice, which shows a lack of awareness of her boundaries. \n\nEven though the author didn't act with malicious intent, in a relationship, respecting your partner's feelings and boundaries is crucial. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because she felt hurt and the situation made her question the author's attention to her boundaries. So, while the author might not have intended to do anything wrong, his lack of awareness and not considering his girlfriend's feelings makes him at least partially in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes), the author is in the wrong because he didn't account for his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries, even if unintentionally.\n"
