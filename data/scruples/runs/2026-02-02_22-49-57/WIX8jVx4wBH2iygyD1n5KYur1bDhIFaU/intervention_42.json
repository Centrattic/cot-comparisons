One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The author had a sleepover with a female friend in his room, and his girlfriend got upset about it. The key points here are the context and the girlfriend's perspective.\n\nFirst, the setup: The friend, Annie, came over to drink and then ended up falling asleep in the author's bed. The author didn't plan for this and thought nothing of it. The girlfriend wasn't present at the time and only found out later. She's upset because of prior conversations where the author mentioned Annie in the context of hypothetical threesomes, which might have made her feel insecure. She also mentioned other instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like holding his hand and playing with his hair when the girlfriend was nearby. \n\nThe author thinks the girlfriend overreacted. But from the girlfriend's point of view, those actions (even if unintended) could be seen as threatening. The fact that they had discussed threesomes and the author mentioned Annie specifically might have made her feel that the author was more open to a scenario involving Annie, leading to jealousy. \n\nNow, considering social norms in relationships, being in bed with another person, even if it's just sleep, can be a red flag for some people. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling insecure and not being respected in terms of boundaries. The author didn't ask his girlfriend beforehand, which is a communication issue. He should have considered her feelings and informed her, especially since they had talked about such scenarios hypothetically. \n\nThe author's argument is that he didn't intend anything wrong, but the problem is that his actions (and past comments) led to the girlfriend feeling that her boundaries were crossed. The author's hyper-awareness after the fact shows he now understands the potential impact, but the question is whether he was in the wrong initially. \n\nSo, while the author didn't have malicious intent, he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings beforehand and didn't communicate properly. The girlfriend's reaction is about trust and boundaries, which are crucial in a relationship. Therefore, the author might be partially in the wrong for not being aware of her perspective and not checking in with her before the sleepover.\n"
