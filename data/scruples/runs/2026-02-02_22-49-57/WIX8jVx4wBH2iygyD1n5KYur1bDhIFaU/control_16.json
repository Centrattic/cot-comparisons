One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author (21M) had a sleepover with his friend Annie (22F) in his room while his girlfriend (20F) was at a concert. They ended up falling asleep together after watching TV and smoking. The girlfriend later confronted him about it, feeling it was inappropriate, especially since they had previously joked about threesomes with Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between the three people. The key points here are: the couple's communication, the boundaries in the relationship, and whether the author's actions crossed any lines. The author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which might be a point of contention. Even though the intention was just to have a friend over, not having that conversation could be seen as a breach of trust or respect for the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nThe girlfriend was upset not just about the sleepover but also about past behaviors with Annie, like hand-holding and hair-playing, which she found concerning. The author didn't notice or acknowledge that these actions made her uncomfortable. Since they had discussed threesomes in a hypothetical way, maybe the girlfriend felt that those jokes made the recent situation more complicated. The author didn't realize the impact of his actions, which shows a lack of awareness of her feelings and boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might not have intended to hurt his girlfriend, but not considering her perspective and not checking in about boundaries could be seen as a mistake. The fact that he's now hyper-aware and worried about the friendship with Annie might indicate that he's starting to understand the issue, but the initial lack of communication and awareness of his girlfriend's signals could mean he was wrong in some way.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the girlfriend overreacted, especially if the sleepover was innocent. But the accumulation of past behaviors and the context of their previous discussions about threesomes might have made her more sensitive. The author's not initiating any of the actions but being a passive participant in Annie's overstepping might not make him entirely at fault, but he could be at fault for not being more attuned to his girlfriend's feelings and for not setting clearer boundaries with Annie. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate with his girlfriend and didn't notice that his actions were making her uncomfortable, even if the intention was innocent. But there's also a strong argument that the girlfriend overreacted, so maybe it's a B (not in the wrong). However, in relationships, even if the actions are innocent, not considering the partner's feelings is a mistake. So I think A is the answer here.\n"
