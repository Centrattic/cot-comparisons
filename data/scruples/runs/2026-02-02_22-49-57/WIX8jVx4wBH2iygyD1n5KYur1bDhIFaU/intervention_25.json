One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author had a sleepover with a female friend in his bed, not informing his girlfriend. The friend was in a relationship, and the girlfriend was upset because she thought the friend was crossing boundaries. The author didn't intend any harm and loves his girlfriend, but now feels the girlfriend overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationships. The author's friend, Annie, is in a long-term relationship, which might be a red flag. The fact that they both fell asleep in the same bed could be seen as a breach of personal boundaries, even if it's accidental or innocent. The girlfriend was upset because she had mentioned boundaries before, and there was a prior conversation about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie. Even if it was joking, bringing that up later might have made the situation more sensitive.\n\nThe author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be a point of contention. In a relationship, communication is key. Even if the act itself was innocent, not discussing potential situations that might make the partner uncomfortable could be seen as a mistake. The girlfriend's reaction might be about feeling that the author didn't consider her feelings or the implications of his actions, especially given their past conversations.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author truly didn't mean anything by it and the situation was accidental, he might not be at fault. However, the context of previous discussions about boundaries and the friend's behavior (like playing with hair and holding hands) adds layers. The girlfriend's sensitivity is valid because past conversations can shape expectations. The author might not have realized the weight of his words or actions, but the girlfriend's feelings are real and justified.\n\nSo, considering that the author didn't communicate with his girlfriend about the sleepover and there's a history of boundary discussions, he might be partially responsible. However, the main issue is the girlfriend's reaction being influenced by prior jokes about threesomes. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for the sleepover itself, but the lack of communication and not being aware of his girlfriend's feelings could make him partially responsible. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards B (No) because the intention was innocent, but maybe there's some room for A (Yes) because of the communication lapse and prior context. Hmm, but the user's own thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide based on the analysis. Given the circumstances, the answer is B.\n"
