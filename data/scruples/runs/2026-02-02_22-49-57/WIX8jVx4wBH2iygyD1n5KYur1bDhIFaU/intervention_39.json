One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, and his girlfriend got upset about it. \n\nFirst, the guy and his friend were hanging out, drank, smoked, and fell asleep in his bed. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. The guy didn't think much of it initially but now feels his girlfriend is overreacting.\n\nI need to consider typical relationship dynamics. In many relationships, boundaries are important. Even if the guy didn't have intentions, the fact that his friend was in his bed without his girlfriend knowing could be a point of contention. The girlfriend brought up past instances where the friend crossed boundaries, which adds to her feeling of mistrust. Also, the guy had mentioned the friend in hypothetical threesome conversations, which might have made the current situation more sensitive.\n\nBut the guy didn't initiate anything, and he had a close friendship with Annie. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from her own insecurities or past experiences. However, being unaware of how his actions affect his partner is part of the problem here. Relationships require communication and considering each other's feelings. The guy might not be at fault for the sleepover itself, but he didn't consider his girlfriend's perspective and prior concerns. His friends' actions (like holding his hand) did bother her, so the sleepover could be seen as another boundary crossed without her input.\n\nSo, while the guy didn't do it on purpose, the key issue is not respecting his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries. He should have been more aware and communicated better. Therefore, he's partially at fault for not acknowledging her discomfort. But is he entirely in the wrong? The question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might be A (yes) because he didn't consider her feelings, but some might argue B (no) because no physical intimacy happened. But in relationships, perception and communication matter a lot. So the answer could be A.\n"
