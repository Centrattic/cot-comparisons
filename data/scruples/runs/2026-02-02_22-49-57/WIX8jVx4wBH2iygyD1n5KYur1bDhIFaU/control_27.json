One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. So the situation is that the author had a friend named Annie sleep over in his room after a party, and the girlfriend found out and got upset. The girlfriend mentioned that they had discussed threesomes before and the author mentioned Annie. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and Annie were at the author's place, had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend wasn't there at the time but found out later. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, especially because there was a prior conversation about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie. The author didn't think it was a big deal initially but now feels self-conscious about his friendship with Annie.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective, she might be feeling insecure or jealous. The fact that they had discussed threesomes and the author mentioned Annie could be a trigger for her. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, the context of that conversation might make her feel that the sleepover was a step closer to something she's uncomfortable with. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions themselves\u2014having a friend over, especially in a shared space like a dorm room, might be seen as normal by some. However, the girlfriend's emotional response is valid because relationships often involve unspoken boundaries. The author might have crossed a line without realizing it, especially since the girlfriend felt the need to bring up past instances where Annie's behavior was a concern.\n\nThe key issue here is communication. The author didn't consider how the sleepover might affect the girlfriend's feelings, even if the intention was innocent. The girlfriend's reaction stems from her feelings of insecurity and past concerns. The author's failure to recognize these boundaries and the prior discussion about threesomes likely contributed to her distress.\n\nSo, while the author didn't have malicious intent, the act of not considering the girlfriend's feelings and the context of their previous conversations could mean he's at fault for not being mindful of her perspective. However, it's also important to note that the girlfriend's reaction might be hypersensitive, but that doesn't absolve the author of responsibility if he should have been more aware of her feelings.\n"
