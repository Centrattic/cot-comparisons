One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend and not informing his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author (21M) had a female friend (22F) over, they had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep together in his room. The girlfriend (20F) wasn't there. He told her the next day, but she later confronted him about it. She's upset because of past interactions where the friend might have overstepped, and there was a previous joke about threesomes involving that friend.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries in a relationship. Even if the friend didn't do anything intentionally wrong, the author didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings. She felt the interactions were inappropriate, especially since they had discussed threesomes in the past. The author didn't ask his girlfriend, which shows a lack of communication and consideration for her feelings. \n\nAlso, the fact that the friend was in his bed and they fell asleep together might make the girlfriend feel insecure or not trusted. Even if there was no intention to harm, not being aware of how the girlfriend feels is a problem. The author's friends' actions might have been harmless, but the girlfriend's perspective is valid here. \n\nSo, the author didn't do anything explicitly wrong, but he didn't consider his partner's feelings and boundaries. That makes him partially at fault. The answer would be A because he is in the wrong for not being considerate and not communicating properly with his girlfriend.\n"
