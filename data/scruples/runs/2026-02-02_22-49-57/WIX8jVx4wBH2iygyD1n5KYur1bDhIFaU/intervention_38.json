One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a sleepover with a female friend, and his girlfriend is upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The author didn't initiate the sleepover; his friend came over to have drinks before a party. They ended up falling asleep together in his room. His girlfriend wasn't there at the time and later got upset. The key points here are about boundaries and communication in a relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend brought up past instances where the friend might have crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding hands. But the author didn't see it as a problem before. The girlfriend's main issue seems to be that the author didn't consider how these interactions affected her. The author claims he didn't mean anything by it and still loves his girlfriend.\n\nThe girlfriend mentioned that the author had previously joked about having a threesome with her and this friend, which might have contributed to her anxiety. Now, the author feels hyper-aware around the friend and worried about the friendship. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, in relationships, it's important to communicate and respect each other's feelings. Even if the author didn't have ill intentions, not considering how his actions might affect his girlfriend's feelings could be a mistake. However, the situation is a bit gray. The friend fell asleep in his bed without his initiation. Maybe the girlfriend felt that any close interaction with an ex or potential ex (if Annie is in a long-term relationship) is a problem. \n\nThe author didn't do anything to intentionally hurt his girlfriend, but he might not have been fully aware of her insecurities. The fact that they had joked about threesomes might have made her more sensitive. In that case, the author could have been more mindful of her feelings, even if the actions themselves were innocent. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? It's possible that the girlfriend overreacted. The situation could depend on their past conversations and boundaries. If they had discussed what's acceptable behavior with friends, then the author might be at fault for not adhering to those boundaries. However, if the boundaries weren't clearly set, then maybe the girlfriend is being overly sensitive. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author didn't intentionally cross any line, and the situation might be more about the girlfriend's insecurity rather than the author's wrongdoing. However, there's a middle ground where the author could have communicated better, but that doesn't necessarily make him in the wrong.\n"
