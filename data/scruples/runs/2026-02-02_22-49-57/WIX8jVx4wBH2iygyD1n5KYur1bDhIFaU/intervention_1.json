One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a sleepover with a female friend in his room, and their girlfriend got upset about it. The author didn't ask his girlfriend, and now the girlfriend is angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship norms. The couple has been together for two years, so they probably have some established boundaries. The author didn't think to inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, which might be a point. Also, there was a previous conversation where the author mentioned wanting to have a threesome with Annie, which the girlfriend now brings up as context. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Even if the author didn't do anything intentionally wrong, not discussing the sleepover could be a breach of trust. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, so from her perspective, the lack of communication is an issue. Also, the fact that Annie's actions, like holding hands or playing with hair, made the girlfriend uncomfortable shows that there's a pattern. The author might not have realized the impact of these actions, but he should be aware of his partner's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate anything inappropriate and values Annie's friendship. The girlfriend is using past comments about threesomes to frame the situation. However, even playful discussions can affect how boundaries are perceived. The author's hyper-awareness now is a consequence of the girlfriend's feelings, which he needs to respect.\n\nSo, while the author might not have acted with malicious intent, the lack of communication and not considering his girlfriend's feelings could mean he's at least partially at fault. The answer might be A (Yes), but I need to check if the situation requires more nuance. The girlfriend's reaction is valid if she felt the boundaries were crossed, even if the author didn't realize it. So, the author might be in the wrong for not being considerate enough of his partner's perspective.\n"
