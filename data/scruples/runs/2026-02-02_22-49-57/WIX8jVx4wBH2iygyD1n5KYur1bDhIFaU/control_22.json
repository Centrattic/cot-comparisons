One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if they're at fault for a sleepover with their male friend and not informing their girlfriend. So, the main points here are the sleepover itself and the girlfriend's reaction based on a previous conversation about threesomes.\n\nFirst, the fact that the friend is in a long-term relationship might be important. The user and their friend, Annie, ended up falling asleep in the same bed after having drinks and smoking. The user's girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and didn't come over. The next morning, he told her, and initially, he didn't think much of it. But when the girlfriend confronted him later, she was upset because of past incidents where Annie had touched him in ways that maybe made her uncomfortable, like playing with his hair and holding hands at a festival. The user didn't realize these actions bothered her. Then there's the part where the user mentioned Annie in a hypothetical threesome conversation, which the girlfriend took into account.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. To determine that, I need to consider the context of their relationship and the girlfriend's perspective. In relationships, communication is key. The user didn't think to ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a lack of consideration. Even though the sleepover was accidental (they fell asleep after socializing), the fact that the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate because of prior incidents and the mention of a hypothetical scenario where Annie was considered for a threesome might make her feel insecure. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction isn't just about the sleepover but about accumulated feelings of being overlooked or not considered in the user's interactions with Annie. The user might not have intended to cause harm, but by not noticing how his actions affected her, he could be guilty of being inconsiderate. Also, the mention of the threesome joke, even if not serious, could have planted seeds of doubt for the girlfriend. \n\nHowever, the user didn't initiate the closeness with Annie, and the sleepover was a result of a plan to go to a party that fell through. The key issue here is whether the user should have been more aware of his girlfriend's feelings and set boundaries to prevent her from feeling this way. Since the user didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover and didn't consider how his past interactions with Annie might affect her, it's possible he's at fault for not prioritizing her feelings in the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction could be seen as overreacting, especially if there wasn't a prior agreement about boundaries with friends. But the user's own mention of Annie in a hypothetical sexual scenario, even if not taken seriously, might have contributed to the girlfriend's discomfort. The user's hyper-awareness of his actions now and fear of damaging the friendship with Annie also shows that he's trying to be considerate, but maybe he's not seeing his part in the situation. \n\nIn summary, while the sleepover wasn't intentional, the combination of prior interactions and the joke about threesomes likely made the girlfriend feel insecure. The user could be in the wrong for not recognizing how these actions, even if innocent, might affect her. So, the answer would be A.\n"
