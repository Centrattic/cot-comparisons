One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're at fault for having a sleepover with their male friend and not asking their girlfriend. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author's friend, Annie, came over for drinks before a party. Their friend bailed, so they ended up watching TV and smoking in the author's room, then fell asleep together. The author didn't inform his girlfriend, who was at a concert with another friend. The next morning, he told her. The girlfriend was upset, even though she admitted he didn't do anything wrong, but she felt that the situation was inappropriate because of past incidents where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand. Also, there was a prior conversation where they joked about threesomes and he mentioned Annie. Now the author feels the girlfriend overreacted and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, in relationships, communication is key. The author didn't think to inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, even though they had discussed boundaries before. Even if he didn't do anything intentionally wrong, not considering her feelings and past concerns could be an issue. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on prior unease, especially with the joke about threesomes. The author might have neglected to acknowledge her boundaries or be proactive in maintaining trust. While the action itself wasn't malicious, the lack of communication and awareness of her feelings could make him partially at fault. But maybe the girlfriend also overreacted. It's a bit of a gray area. Hmm.\n"
