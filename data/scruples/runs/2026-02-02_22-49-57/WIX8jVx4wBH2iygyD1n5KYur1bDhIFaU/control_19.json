One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation involves a guy (21M) who had a sleepover with his friend Annie (22F) in his room, and his girlfriend (20F) found out and got upset. The key points are:\n\n1. The author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover. He just mentioned it the next day.\n2. Annie and the author are close friends, and there were previous instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like holding his hand and playing with his hair while his girlfriend was nearby. The author didn't notice these as problematic.\n3. The girlfriend was upset partly because the author had previously mentioned Annie as a potential person for a threesome in a hypothetical conversation.\n4. The author now feels his girlfriend overreacted and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms and communication. In most relationships, partners expect some level of transparency and consideration. Not informing the girlfriend about a sleepover with a friend in the same room could be seen as a lack of communication, especially if there are past issues with boundaries. The girlfriend pointing out the hypothetical threesome comment adds context to why she felt hurt\u2014maybe she felt the mention of Annie in that context made the recent sleepover more significant.\n\nThe author's defense is that he didn't initiate the sleepover and thought nothing of it. But in relationships, it's not just about actions but also about how those actions make the partner feel. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because she felt the sleepover and previous interactions were crossing boundaries, even if the author didn't intend them to. The fact that he didn't notice her discomfort before suggests there might be a communication breakdown.\n\nSo, while the author might not have had malicious intent, the key issue is whether he was considerate of his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries. Failing to communicate openly and being unaware of her concerns could place some responsibility on him. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (at fault), but it's a bit nuanced. However, given the girlfriend's valid reasons and the lack of communication from the author, the answer is likely A.\n"
