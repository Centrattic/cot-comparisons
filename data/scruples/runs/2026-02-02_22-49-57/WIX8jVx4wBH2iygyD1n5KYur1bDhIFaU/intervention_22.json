One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he had a sleepover with his female friend Annie, who's in a long-term relationship, and didn't inform his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, partly because she mentioned in the past that if they ever had threesomes, they'd consider Annie. But the author didn't initiate anything and didn't realize his friend was crossing boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationships. The author and Annie were hanging out, fell asleep together in his room. The girlfriend was at a concert and didn't come over. The next day, he told her, but she was upset about the sleepover and some past interactions where Annie touched him in ways that might be seen as overstepping, like playing with his hair and holding hands at a festival. The main issue seems to be the sleepover and the past comments about threesomes.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's reaction is based on her feelings of being ignored or not considered. The author didn't ask her before having the sleepover, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if there was no physical intimacy, the fact that Annie was in his bed and the girlfriend wasn't there might make her feel neglected or insecure. Also, the past comments about threesomes might have made her feel that the author had a preference for Annie, which could exacerbate the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have any intention of violating the relationship. He thought it was just hanging out with a friend. The friend Annie is in a relationship herself, so maybe she's also aware of boundaries. However, the key point is the lack of communication. The author didn't check with his girlfriend before having Annie over, which is important in a relationship where trust and communication are crucial.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might seem a bit over the top from the author's perspective, but her feelings are valid. She felt that the sleepover and Annie's past behaviors made her uncomfortable. The author's not being aware of how his actions affected her is a problem because in relationships, it's important to be considerate of the partner's feelings, even if the author didn't mean anything by it.\n\nSo, even though the author didn't do anything physically wrong, the lack of communication and not considering his girlfriend's feelings might make him at least partially at fault. He should have discussed the sleepover with her beforehand, especially given their previous conversations about threesomes. By not doing so, he might have unintentionally hurt her feelings, which is a valid issue in the relationship.\n"
