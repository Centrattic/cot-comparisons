One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a guy, had a sleepover with his female friend Annie in his bed. His girlfriend found out and got upset. The author is asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sleepover was after they both decided not to go to a party. They watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend wasn't present and later got upset. The author didn't ask his girlfriend about it, which might be a point. But he didn't initiate anything, just let it happen.\n\nThe girlfriend's main issues are about the sleepover and previous instances where Annie was affectionate. She also mentioned a past conversation where the author joked about having a threesome with Annie, which she feels adds to the problem. The author thinks the girlfriend is overreacting.\n\nNow, in relationships, communication is key. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, the fact that he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings and didn't check in with her could be a problem. Allowing his friend to sleep in his bed might be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if the girlfriend is uneasy about it. Also, the past comments about threesomes might have planted seeds of insecurity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't do anything intentionally wrong. He had a friend over, and they fell asleep. The girlfriend's reaction could be out of proportion if there's no prior issues about boundaries. But relationships are about both partners' comfort levels. If the author knew the girlfriend might feel uncomfortable and didn't consider that, he might be at fault for not being more considerate.\n\nThe key factors here are communication and mutual respect. The author might not be in the wrong for the sleepover itself, but he could have been more thoughtful about how his actions affect his girlfriend. Since the girlfriend brought up past instances and the conversation about threesomes, the author's lack of awareness of her feelings could make him partially responsible. The answer depends on whether the actions were careless despite knowing potential issues.\n"
