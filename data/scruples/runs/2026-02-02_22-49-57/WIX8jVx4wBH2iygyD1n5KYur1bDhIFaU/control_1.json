One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me read through the details again to make sure I understand everything properly.\n\nThe author is a guy in a two-year relationship with a 20-year-old girlfriend. He had a sleepover with his 21-year-old male friend and 22-year-old female friend, Annie, who is in a long-term relationship. They were at the author's place, had some drinks, watched TV, smoked weed, and fell asleep in his bed. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and didn't come over. The next day, the author told her about Annie falling asleep in his bed, but didn't think much of it. Later, the girlfriend confronts him about it, saying it was inappropriate. She also mentions other instances where Annie might have crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand at a festival while she was alone. The author didn't notice these things before. The girlfriend brought up a past conversation where they jokingly discussed having threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. The author now feels his girlfriend is overreacting and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did something wrong. The key points here are the sleepover situation and the friend Annie's actions. The author didn't initiate anything with Annie, but they ended up in his bed together. The girlfriend is upset about this, even though the author claims he didn't do anything on purpose. The girlfriend's main issue seems to be about the boundaries and the previous conversation about threesomes, which she feels adds context to her discomfort.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The author may not have intended to hurt his girlfriend, but the fact that he had a female friend sleep in his bed could be seen as crossing a line, especially if the girlfriend is uncomfortable. Even if they were just hanging out and fell asleep, the situation could be misinterpreted or seen as a breach of trust. Additionally, the past discussion about threesomes and the author mentioning Annie in that context might have made the girlfriend feel his attraction to Annie was more than platonic, even if it was just a joke.\n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the sleepover; they were waiting for a friend to bail. The fact that they just fell asleep without doing anything inappropriate might mean the author isn't entirely at fault. But the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and not noticing her discomfort over previous interactions with Annie could indicate a lack of attention to her boundaries.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author should have been more mindful of his girlfriend's feelings. The author might not have done anything malicious, but he failed to consider how his actions affected her. In relationships, even if actions aren't harmful, the impact on the partner matters. The author's not noticing Annie's overstepping could be a communication issue, where he wasn't aware of what made her uncomfortable. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not being more attuned to his girlfriend's feelings and not addressing the boundaries earlier.\n"
