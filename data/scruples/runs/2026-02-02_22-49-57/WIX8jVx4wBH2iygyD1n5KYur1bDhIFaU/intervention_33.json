One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with his 21-year-old male friend and a 22-year-old female friend, without informing his 20-year-old girlfriend. The key points here are the setup of the situation, the girlfriend's reaction, and the author's perspective.\n\nFirst, the sleepover wasn't planned. They were going to a party, but when the friend bailed, they decided to stay back. The TV is in the author's room, and they fell asleep there. The girlfriend was at a concert and didn't come over because they didn't go to the party. The author didn't ask his girlfriend because he didn't see the need; they had already made the decision to not go to the party, so he didn't think to inform her about sleeping over with Annie. \n\nThen, the next day, he told her, and she was upset. She mentioned past incidents where Annie held his hand and played with his hair, which he thought were innocent. The girlfriend linked this to a previous joke about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie, which seems to have triggered her feelings. Now the author is feeling like he's in the wrong because his girlfriend is upset, and he's worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The author didn't consider that even if the sleepover was accidental, his girlfriend might feel left out or insecure. The fact that they had previously discussed threesomes and he mentioned Annie could have planted seeds of doubt in her mind. Even if he didn't mean anything by the past interactions, his girlfriend might perceive them as crossing boundaries, especially if she's sensitive to her partner's attention to others.\n\nHowever, the author didn't intentionally do anything wrong. The sleepover was unplanned, and he made his girlfriend aware the next morning. The problem here is more about differing expectations and unspoken boundaries. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because in a relationship, partners often need to agree on what's acceptable. The author's actions, while not malicious, might have inadvertently hurt her feelings or made her feel insecure.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. If he had discussed it with his girlfriend beforehand, even if it was a spur-of-the-moment decision, it might have prevented hurt feelings. But since it was accidental and he didn't have malicious intent, maybe not. The girlfriend's reaction is more about how she felt and the prior joke about threesomes. The answer likely depends on the specific dynamics of their relationship and how they handle each other's boundaries. But generally, not being aware of how one's actions affect a partner can be a point of contention, even if unintentional.\n"
