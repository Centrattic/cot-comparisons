One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing his girlfriend. So, first, the situation: the author, who's 21, has a female friend, Annie, who's 22. They had a sleepover together in his room after a party plan fell through. The girlfriend, who's 20, found out later and was upset. She brought up past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding hands at a festival. The author didn't realize these made his girlfriend uncomfortable. Also, there was a prior conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A or B. Let me think about the key points here. The main issue seems to be about the girlfriend's feelings of insecurity and the author's lack of awareness of her boundaries. The author didn't intend any wrongdoing, but his actions and past jokes might have contributed to her distress. \n\nFirst, the sleepover itself. While the author didn't do anything intentionally, not informing his girlfriend could be seen as a breach of trust, even if it wasn't malicious. Communication is key in relationships, and not sharing such events might have made the girlfriend feel excluded or insecure. \n\nThen there's the part about the past interactions. The author might not have realized that Annie's actions were making his girlfriend uncomfortable. That points to a lack of awareness on the author's part. He should have been more conscious of how his interactions with other friends might affect his girlfriend. \n\nThe threesomes joke is another factor. Even if it was meant as a joke, mentioning the same friend who later crossed boundaries could have planted seeds of doubt in the girlfriend's mind. The author's mention of Annie in that context might have made the girlfriend more sensitive to any future interactions between them. \n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the sleepover; it was spontaneous. He didn't have sexual intentions. He also felt bad after the fact and became more cautious. But the key here is the girlfriend's perspective. In relationships, how one person feels about certain actions matters, even if the other person didn't mean harm. The author's failure to consider his girlfriend's feelings and his past jokes about Annie might have contributed to her upset. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He didn't act with malice, but he may not have respected his girlfriend's boundaries enough. The lack of communication and the prior comments about Annie could be seen as contributing factors. The answer might depend on cultural norms, relationship expectations, and how both parties communicate their needs. But since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, considering the girlfriend's feelings and the impact of his actions, even if unintended, he might share some responsibility. Therefore, the answer might be A, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the focus is on intent and the author had no malicious intent, maybe B. Hmm.\n"
