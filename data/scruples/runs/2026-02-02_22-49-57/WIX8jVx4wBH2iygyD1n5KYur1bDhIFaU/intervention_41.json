One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend without telling his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: the author had a friend, Annie, who came over to drink, then watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend found out later and got upset. The key points here are about boundaries and communication.\n\nThe author didn't intentionally do anything to hurt his girlfriend. They didn't know Annie would fall asleep there. But the girlfriend was upset because of past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like holding hands or playing with hair when the girlfriend was nearby. Plus, there was a previous joke about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie, which might have made the girlfriend feel insecure.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. On one hand, the author didn't mean any harm and didn't initiate the sleepover. On the other hand, even if unintentional, having a friend sleep in the same bed could be seen as overstepping in a relationship. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be more about accumulated issues and her feeling insecure, not just the one incident.\n\nBut the author didn't ask for permission, and it's common for people's reactions to be influenced by past experiences. The author didn't have malicious intent, but maybe they didn't consider how their actions made their girlfriend feel, even if they didn't realize it. So, is the author in the wrong for not being aware of her feelings? Maybe not entirely, but they could have communicated better. However, the main issue is the girlfriend's reaction being blown out of proportion based on past jokes and other incidents. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering the context and the lack of intentional wrongdoing, the answer is likely B.\n"
