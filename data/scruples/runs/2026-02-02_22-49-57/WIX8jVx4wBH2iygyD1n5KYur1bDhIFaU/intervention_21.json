One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether they're at fault (AITA) for having a sleepover with their female friend and not informing their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author and Annie, a friend in a long-term relationship, had a sleepover. They had drinks, smoked, watched TV, and fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend found out the next morning and was upset. She also mentioned past incidents where Annie touched the author (hair, hand) when the girlfriend was nearby. The author had mentioned Annie in a conversation about hypothetical threesomes, but not seriously.\n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't initiate anything, just drifted into the situation. The girlfriend's main issue seems to be the lack of communication and the past joke about threesomes, which the author didn't take seriously at the time. The author now feels their girlfriend overreacted and is worried about their friendship with Annie.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust and communication are crucial. The author didn't ask their girlfriend, which could be seen as a breach of trust, even if it was innocent. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and the potential for misunderstandings, especially given the past comments. The author might not be intentionally wrong, but not considering their partner's feelings is a mistake. On the other hand, the girlfriend's concern is valid if she's uncomfortable with Annie being in the same bed. The author's hyper-awareness and fear of changing the friendship suggest they care about both relationships.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might not have intended harm, but the situation could have been avoided with better communication. The answer is likely B (No), but there's room for argument about the girlfriend's perspective being valid. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing, and since they didn't act with malice, it's a judgment call. The community often considers intentions, so if the author was careless, maybe a slight A. But given the context and the author's clarification, leaning towards B.\n"
