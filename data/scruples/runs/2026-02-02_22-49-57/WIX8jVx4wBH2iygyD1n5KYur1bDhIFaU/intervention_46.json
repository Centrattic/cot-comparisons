One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with his 21-year-old male friend and a 22-year-old female friend, not informing his girlfriend, and then facing some backlash. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's friend Annie, who's in a long-term relationship, came over for drinks before a party. They ended up watching TV in his room, smoked some cannabis, and fell asleep. The author's girlfriend was at a concert with a friend. The next day, the author told her about Annie sleeping in his bed. The girlfriend was upset because she felt Annie crossed boundaries in the past (like playing with hair, holding hands) and also mentioned a previous joke about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and boundaries. The author didn't initiate anything; they just fell asleep. He didn't have any intentions beyond that. He informed his girlfriend the next day. The girlfriend's anger stems from past behaviors she perceived as crossing lines and a previous joke. \n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective: She felt her boundaries were not respected, even if the author didn't mean to. The previous mention of threesomes involving Annie might have triggered her because it's a sensitive topic. Even if they were joking, bringing up such topics can create tension.\n\nThe author's stance is that he didn't do anything wrong, didn't initiate the sleepover, and didn't realize how his actions affected her. But he's now hyper-aware of his behavior around Annie, fearing it might affect their friendship. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author didn't act with malice. The sleepover wasn't intentional beyond hanging out, and he informed his girlfriend. However, the issue might be about not being considerate of her feelings regarding Annie's behavior and the previous joke. Even if the jokes weren't serious, they might have planted seeds in the girlfriend's mind. The author might not have realized the weight of those past actions. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's action\u2014while not malicious\u2014might have been a trigger for the girlfriend. The fact that Annie is in a relationship herself could add another layer, but the main issue here is the girlfriend's perspective.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit nuanced. He didn't do anything intentionally harmful, but he might have been unaware of how his actions affected his girlfriend. The girlfriend is entitled to her feelings, even if they seem overblown. The author's responsibility is more about future awareness and communication rather than being wrong in this specific instance. Therefore, the answer leans towards B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong, but there are aspects where better communication could have been done. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether the girlfriend is right. Since he didn't act with intent to harm, the answer is B.\n"
