One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a sleepover with a female friend (Annie) in their room, leading to the girlfriend being upset. The author didn't ask the girlfriend about the sleepover and later realized that a past joke about threesomes with Annie made the girlfriend feel uneasy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of relationships. In a relationship, communication is key. The author didn't inform their girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a breach of trust, even if they didn't intend anything inappropriate. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling excluded or not respected in the relationship. The fact that they had previously discussed threesomes jokingly adds another layer because it shows the author might have been dismissive of the girlfriend's feelings in the past.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the author's actions. They allowed Annie to stay in their room, fell asleep together, and didn't consider how the girlfriend might feel. Even if there was no intent to cross boundaries, the situation itself could be perceived as crossing a line. The girlfriend pointing out Annie's other actions (like holding hands) that the author didn't notice suggests that the author was unaware of how their behavior affected the girlfriend.\n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the sleepover and didn't have any intention to be inappropriate. They might not have realized the importance of communication in this context. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be more about the underlying issues (like the threesome joke) rather than the sleepover itself. \n\nBut in relationships, partners often have boundaries, and respecting those is crucial. By not discussing the sleepover beforehand, the author might have violated an implicit boundary. The key here is whether the author should have been more considerate of the girlfriend's perspective. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't do anything malicious. They thought it was a casual sleepover. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author's failure to communicate could contribute to her feeling upset. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions, regardless of intent, were careless toward the girlfriend's feelings. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but they did make a mistake by not communicating. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer could be B (No), but there's a nuance. Alternatively, maybe A (Yes) because they should have considered their girlfriend's feelings more. Hmm.\n"
