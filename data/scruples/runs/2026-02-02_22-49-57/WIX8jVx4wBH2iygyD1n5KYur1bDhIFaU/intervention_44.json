One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a guy (author) who had a sleepover with his friend Annie (22F) and didn't inform his girlfriend (20F). The girlfriend got upset about it and brought up past incidents where Annie might have crossed boundaries, like holding the author's hand while the girlfriend was nearby. Also, there was a previous conversation where they jokingly discussed threesomes and the author mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. In a relationship, communication and trust are key. The girlfriend felt that the author didn't consider her feelings by not mentioning the sleepover. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, the act of not informing her could be seen as a breach of trust. Relationships often have unspoken boundaries, and if the author and Annie were close friends, the girlfriend might feel that the sleepover in his room was a step too close. \n\nThen there's the past behavior: Annie holding his hand and the author mentioning her in the context of a threesome. Even if it was a joke, bringing up the idea of sleeping with a friend can be a trigger for the girlfriend. The fact that she felt the need to bring up these past incidents suggests that these things had been building up, and the sleepover was the last straw. \n\nThe author might not have intended to hurt her, but not noticing her discomfort and not addressing it until she confronted him shows a lack of awareness. The girlfriend did say he didn't do anything wrong, but the fact that he didn't notice her feelings is part of the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate the sleepover, and he and Annie just fell asleep after hanging out. The situation might have been innocent, but in a relationship, how things are perceived can be as important as the actual actions. The key here is whether the author should have been more considerate and communicated better with his girlfriend to avoid her feeling insecure. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't do anything malicious, the lack of communication and not considering his girlfriend's perspective could make him at least partially responsible. The girlfriend's reaction is about her feelings and the trust in the relationship. The author's hyper-awareness now shows that he realizes the importance of these boundaries, but maybe he should have been more attentive before. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the communication breakdown, even if his intentions were innocent. However, the girlfriend might be overreacting if there's no history of jealousy or if the situation was genuinely innocent. But given the context, the answer could be A or B depending on the perspective. However, the main issue here is the lack of communication, so the author might share some responsibility.\n"
