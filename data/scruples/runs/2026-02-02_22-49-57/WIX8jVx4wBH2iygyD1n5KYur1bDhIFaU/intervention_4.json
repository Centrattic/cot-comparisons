One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author (21M) had a sleepover with their friend Annie (22F) in their room, and didn't ask their girlfriend (20F). The girlfriend was upset about it, especially because there was a past conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and Annie had a sleepover, fell asleep in the same bed. The author's girlfriend was at a concert and didn't come over. The next day, the author told the girlfriend, but didn't think much of it. Later, the girlfriend explained why she was upset, bringing up other instances where Annie might have crossed boundaries. The author didn't realize these were bothering the girlfriend until now.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries in a relationship. The girlfriend felt that the sleepover was inappropriate, and the fact that they had previously joked about threesomes involving Annie probably made her feel more insecure. The author didn't intend to cause harm, but maybe didn't consider how the girlfriend would feel. Even if the author didn't do anything wrong on purpose, not asking the girlfriend before having a friend over, especially in the bedroom, could be seen as a breach of trust. The author might not have realized the significance of the past comment about threesomes, which could have made the girlfriend more sensitive to this situation.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling that her boundaries are being crossed, even if the author didn't cross them. In a healthy relationship, communication is key. The author might have thought it was harmless, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The author should have checked in with the girlfriend before the sleepover to avoid causing hurt feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate the sleepover; it just happened after they both fell asleep. However, the fact that they didn't inform the girlfriend beforehand could be a problem. The girlfriend's reaction is about trust and feeling that her partner is being too close to another person, which is a common concern in relationships. The author's not noticing these signs before might indicate a lack of attention to the girlfriend's feelings, which could be a mistake.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if the author didn't do anything intentionally wrong, the failure to communicate and consider the girlfriend's feelings could place some responsibility on the author. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), or maybe B (not in the wrong). But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author didn't do anything physically wrong but failed to communicate, it's a gray area. In relationships, intentions matter, but so does the impact. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, so the author could be seen as not being considerate enough, hence in the wrong. But others might argue that the girlfriend is overreacting. However, since the question is about AITA (Am I the Asshole?), the answer might lean towards A if the author should have been more communicative.\n"
