One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a guy, had a sleepover with his female friend Annie in his bed, and didn't inform his girlfriend. The girlfriend was upset about it. The author is asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they were at a party, but their friend bailed, so they stayed in the author's room, drank, smoked, and fell asleep. The author's girlfriend was at a concert with a friend. The next day, he told her about Annie sleeping in his bed. The girlfriend got upset, especially because there was a prior conversation where the author joked about having a threesome with Annie. \n\nSo, the main issues here might be about trust, communication, and boundaries in the relationship. Even though the author didn't have any intention of cheating, the act of having a friend sleep in his bed could be seen as a boundary issue by the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that her boundaries are not respected, especially since there was a previous joke about threesomes involving Annie. Even if the joke wasn't meant seriously, it might have made the girlfriend feel uneasy about the dynamic between the author and Annie.\n\nThe author didn't ask his girlfriend before inviting Annie over. In relationships, communication is key. Even if the action itself (sleeping in the same bed) didn't involve anything inappropriate, the lack of transparency could be a problem. The girlfriend might feel that her feelings aren't considered, especially since she had mentioned before that Annie's behavior (like playing with hair or holding hands) was an issue. The author didn't notice or acknowledge those concerns until after the fact.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong from his own perspective because he didn't intend harm, but in relationships, actions can still be problematic if they hurt the partner. The girlfriend's reaction is valid if she felt the situation was disrespectful to the relationship's boundaries. The fact that the author was unaware of how his actions affected her suggests a communication gap. \n\nAlso, the prior joke about threesomes with Annie might have planted a seed of doubt in the girlfriend's mind, making her more sensitive to situations involving Annie. Even if the joke was lighthearted, it's possible that the girlfriend took it more seriously, and the sleepover incident triggered those concerns.\n\nSo, while the author didn't have malicious intent, the situation could be seen as a failure to respect the girlfriend's boundaries and a lack of communication. Therefore, the author might be partially in the wrong because he didn't consider how his actions and past jokes could affect her feelings and the trust in the relationship.\n"
