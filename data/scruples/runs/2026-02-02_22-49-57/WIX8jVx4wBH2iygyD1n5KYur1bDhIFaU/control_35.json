One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The scenario involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, which led to some tension with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the author had a friend, Annie, over. They ended up falling asleep in his bed after a few drinks and some joint. The girlfriend found out the next day and was upset. The author didn't think much of it initially but later learned that the girlfriend had been bothered by previous interactions between the author and Annie, like playing with hair and holding hands at a festival. The girlfriend also mentioned that the author had joked about having a threesome with Annie, which added to her feelings of betrayal.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries in a relationship. The author didn't intend to be disrespectful, but the girlfriend felt that the actions crossed lines she had. The author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a lack of communication. Even though he didn't initiate the interactions, not being aware of how his actions affected her is a problem. Also, the previous jokes about threesomes might have made the situation more sensitive.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is about her emotional boundaries and how she felt the author wasn't respecting them. The author's defense is that he didn't mean anything by it, but in a relationship, it's important to consider the partner's feelings and boundaries, even if unintentional. The fact that he now feels hyper-aware and fears losing a friendship suggests that the situation has created tension, but that's more about the consequences rather than who is right or wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether his actions, while not intended maliciously, disregarded his girlfriend's boundaries. Since the girlfriend felt hurt and the author hadn't considered her perspective, it's likely that he is partially at fault for not being more mindful of her feelings and for not communicating the sleepover beforehand. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes), as the author is in the wrong for not respecting his girlfriend's boundaries and not considering her feelings in the situation.\n"
