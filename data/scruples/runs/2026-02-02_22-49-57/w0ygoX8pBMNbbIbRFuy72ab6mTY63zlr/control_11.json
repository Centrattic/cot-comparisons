I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author did something wrong by reporting the vegan activist and getting her arrested. The situation involves a confrontation between the author and Karen from DxE.\n\nFirst, the incident started with Karen initiating conversation about the dog. She then accused the author of being selfish for buying a purebred, which led to a conflict. Karen grabbed the leash and pushed the author. The author called the police, who arrested her. \n\nNow, the key points here are: Did Karen's actions cross the line into criminal behavior? Grabbing someone's leash and pushing them could be considered assault or disorderly conduct. The author was defending their property (the dog) and personal space. The police arrested Karen, which suggests they found some wrongdoing on her part.\n\nThe author might be in the right because they were acting in self-defense and protecting their dog. However, there's a question of whether the author provoked the situation by engaging in the conversation. But the user mentioned that Karen approached first, and the author was trying to leave. The neighbor's testimony supports the author's account.\n\nAlso, the author reported Karen after she committed an apparent assault. The fact that Karen was trying to take the dog's leash could be seen as an attempt to interfere with the author's property. The police revoked the protest permit for Karen specifically, indicating that her actions were outside the allowed protest activities.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be justified as they responded to an aggressive act. The author didn't provoke Karen beyond the initial conversation. The arrest and subsequent legal charges against Karen seem appropriate given her physical actions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
