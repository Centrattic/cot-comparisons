I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict between two individuals during a protest.\n\nFirst, the person walking their dog is approached by Karen, a protestor. The initial interaction seems friendly when Karen compliments the dog. Then, Karen brings up the issue of dog overpopulation, which the person acknowledges but explains their choice of breeder. The conversation escalates when Karen starts yelling, calling the person names, and physically grabbing the dog's leash, leading to a confrontation where the person reports her to the police. Karen gets arrested, and the person is now facing a court case, possibly with a felony charge.\n\nThe key points to consider here are the use of force and intent. The person claims they were trying to protect their dog and themselves. Karen's actions of grabbing the leash and pushing could be considered assault, which justifies reporting her. However, the person's role in the incident needs to be evaluated. They initially tried to walk away but were followed and harassed. The police were involved, and the arrest was made. The person might argue self-defense and protecting their property (the dog). \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the person could have de-escalated the situation without involving the police, especially since it was a protest. But given Karen's aggressive behavior and the physical altercation, reporting her might be justified. The potential felony charge for the person could relate to false reporting if there's no evidence of Karen's intent to harm. However, the presence of a neighbor as a witness supports the person's account.\n\nIn conclusion, the person's actions were in response to an attack on them and their dog, supported by a witness. The act of reporting a crime that occurred, even if it led to an arrest, might be seen as their right. Therefore, the person might not be in the wrong.\n"
