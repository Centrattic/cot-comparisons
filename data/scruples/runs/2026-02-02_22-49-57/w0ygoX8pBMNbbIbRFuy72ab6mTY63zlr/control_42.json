I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. They provided a detailed story where the person was confronted by a protester who then grabbed their dog's leash and pushed them. The person called the police, leading to the activist's arrest and potential felony charges.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The key points are the confrontation: the activist approached the person, discussed dog breeding, became aggressive, grabbed the leash, pushed them, and was shouting. The person then reported this to the police, resulting in an arrest.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if someone physically assaults another person, even in the heat of an argument, that's a criminal act. The person being assaulted has the right to report it. The activist's actions\u2014grabbing the leash and pushing\u2014could be considered assault or battery, depending on jurisdiction. In many places, that's a crime, so the person reporting it wouldn't be in the wrong.\n\nHowever, there's also the context of the protest. The user mentions that the DxE protest was happening, and they felt bad about revoking the protest permit. They weren't targeting the group but an individual who acted aggressively. The user didn't instigate the confrontation; they were trying to walk away. Their neighbor was a witness, which supports their account.\n\nPotential issues could be if the user provoked the activist, but the story says they were just walking the dog and the activist approached them. The user also didn't initiate the conflict. They tried to de-escalate by walking away and explaining their breeder choice. The activist's escalation into physical aggression is the main problem here.\n\nSo, considering self-defense and the right to report a crime, the user isn't in the wrong. The activist's actions were criminal, and the user had every right to involve the police. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
