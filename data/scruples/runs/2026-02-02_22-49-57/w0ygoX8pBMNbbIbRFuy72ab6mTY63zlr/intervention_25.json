I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about reporting a vegan activist to the police after an altercation. The author's dog was grabbed by the activist, leading to her arrest. The user thinks the author isn't at fault, but I need to analyze it.\n\nFirst, the context: The author was walking their dog in a neighborhood with health-conscious people. They encountered someone protesting, who then engaged in a conversation. The activist started questioning the breeder choice, leading to an argument. The activist became aggressive, grabbed the leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. The author and a neighbor reported the incident, leading to the activist's arrest.\n\nKey points to consider: \n1. Did the author provoke the situation? The author says they were just walking the dog, answered questions, and walked away when uncomfortable. The activist followed, escalated the situation with insults, and physically acted out. The author didn't initiate the conflict; it seems the activist did.\n2. The author reported the incident when the activist physically attacked. The police were involved, and the activist was arrested. The author might have a witness (neighbor) supporting their account.\n3. The author feels conflicted about the arrest because they respect free speech but believe the activist's actions crossed a line. They didn't target the entire group but reported the individual who became violent.\n4. Legal consequences: The activist is facing a felony charge. The author could potentially face charges if they were at fault, but since the activist acted first, it's less likely. However, the value of free speech vs. protection from assault is a factor here.\n\nPossible angles where the author could be at fault: If the author's response was excessive or if they provoked the activist, but according to the narrative, they tried to walk away and avoid confrontation. The activist's actions were the direct cause. Also, reporting a protestor for aggressive behavior isn't inherently wrong, especially when it involves physical harm to a person and their pet.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overreacted by pressing charges, but given the physical assault and attempted abduction of the dog, the author had a right to self-defense and to seek help. The neighbor's presence adds credibility to their account.\n\nIn terms of legal and moral responsibility, the activist's actions were clearly illegal (assault, trying to take someone else's property). The author's actions in reporting this are justified. The fact that the author felt bad about ruining the permit for the protest suggests they respect free speech but also recognize when actions cross into illegality.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted in self-defense and reported a crime. The activist's actions were the root cause. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
