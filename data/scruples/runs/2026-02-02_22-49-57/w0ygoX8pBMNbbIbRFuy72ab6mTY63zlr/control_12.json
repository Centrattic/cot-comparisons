I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person was walking their dog when a vegan activist approached them. The activist got confrontational, accused them of selfishness, tried to grab the dog's leash, pushed them, and tried to run off with the dog. The author reported her, she got arrested, and now the author is facing a felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The key points are: the interaction started with a friendly question about the dog. Then the activist brought up the issue of shelter dogs being euthanized, leading to an argument. The activist then tried to grab the leash, pushed the author, and attempted to take the dog. The author and a neighbor intervened, the police were called, and the activist was arrested. The author is now concerned about being charged because they reported her.\n\nNow, the legal aspects. If someone tries to take another person's dog by force, that's likely assault or theft. The author reported a crime that was committed against them. The police arrested the activist, which suggests that there was a valid incident. The author didn't provoke the activist; they were reacting to an attack. The activist's actions were aggressive and possibly criminal. The author's response was to seek help from the police, which is the correct course of action when someone is being attacked.\n\nThe author might be worried about retaliation or legal consequences, but unless they fabricated the incident, they are within their rights to report a crime. The activist's group might have had a permit, but if the individual committed a crime, that's a separate issue. The author isn't responsible for the protest's permit status; they're responding to an assault.\n\nHowever, one thing to consider: was the activist's behavior protected under protest? If the activist was part of a legal protest, maybe their actions were part of their activism. But grabbing someone's dog and pushing them isn't protected speech\u2014it's a physical assault. The author didn't start the confrontation; they were defending themselves and their dog. The neighbor's testimony supports the author's account.\n\nIn legal terms, reporting a crime you've been a victim of is not wrong. The author isn't to blame for someone else's criminal actions. The activist's group might have had a cause, but individual criminal acts aren't justified. The author's actions in reporting the assault are justified. The possible felony charge the author is facing might relate to the activist's retaliation or some other issue, but the initial report was appropriate. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
