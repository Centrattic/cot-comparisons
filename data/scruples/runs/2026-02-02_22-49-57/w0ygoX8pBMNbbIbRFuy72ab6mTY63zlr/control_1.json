I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author did something wrong here. The situation is that the author reported a vegan activist to the police, which led to her arrest and potential felony charge. The user is asking if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author was walking their dog when a woman from DxE started talking to them. The conversation turned heated when the woman accused the author of being selfish for getting a purebred dog from a breeder. Then the woman physically tried to take the dog's leash, leading to the author reporting her. The police intervened, and Karen got arrested.\n\nNow, I need to consider the legal aspects. The key points here are: Did the author have a right to report the woman? Was there an actual crime committed? The woman tried to grab the dog's leash and physically pushed the author. That sounds like assault and battery, which are criminal offenses. If the author was acting in self-defense when they reported her, that might be justified. The author had a witness, their neighbor, so there's evidence supporting their side.\n\nBut wait, the author initiated the report. The woman was part of a protest group, but she individually acted aggressively. The police might have determined that she committed an assault, especially if she tried to take the dog. In many places, assault is a felony, especially if it involves physical contact. The author didn't provoke her beyond the conversation. The woman escalated the situation by grabbing the leash and pushing. So the author acting to defend themselves and their dog seems reasonable.\n\nAnother angle: Free speech vs. violence. The author is not responsible for the protest group's activities as long as they're peaceful. However, Karen crossed the line into physical aggression. The author reporting her for the assault is not wrong because it's a separate issue from the protest. The police would handle her for the assault, which is a criminal act, not just the protest.\n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling torn about the arrest, which shows they're considering others' rights. But their primary responsibility is to their own safety and their dog's. The author had a right to report the assault. The neighbor's testimony would back them up. So, legally, the author is not in the wrong for reporting a crime. The felony charge against Karen, if it's for assault, might be appropriate based on the facts given.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author acted within their rights by reporting an assault. They didn't instigate the violence. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
