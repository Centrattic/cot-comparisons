I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and potential felony charges. \n\nFirst, the situation: The writer was walking their dog when approached by Karen, a DxE protester. Karen started a conversation, then confronted the writer about breeding dogs, leading to an argument. Karen then tried to grab the dog's leash, pushed the writer, and was arrested. The writer called the police, and now Karen faces charges.\n\nThe key points to consider are the actions of both parties. The writer was in a public place, walking their dog, and initially had a friendly interaction. When Karen started to pressure the writer about their dog breeding choices, the writer tried to end the conversation. Karen escalated the situation by grabbing the leash and pushing the writer. The writer's response was to involve the police because there was a physical assault.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if someone uses force against another person without consent, that can be a criminal act, such as assault or battery. The writer's action of reporting the incident to the police was appropriate because they were protecting themselves from an aggressive person. The police's decision to revoke the protest permit for Karen might be because her actions were outside the bounds of peaceful protest, possibly involving harassment or violence.\n\nIt's also important to note that the writer didn't provoke the initial confrontation. They were simply walking their dog and were not involved in the protest. The escalation was on Karen's part. The writer didn't engage in any illegal activities; they reported a crime that was committed against them. \n\nThere's a mention of the writer feeling bad about the arrest because other protesters were just doing their thing. This shows that the writer is aware of the difference between Karen's actions and the peaceful protest, which was likely legal. The writer didn't target the entire group but reported the individual who physically attacked them.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the writer acted in self-defense. Reporting a crime is a citizen's duty, especially when physical harm is involved. The writer didn't have a grudge against Karen or the organization; they were reacting to an immediate threat. The potential charges against Karen are based on her actions, not the writer's.\n\nPossible counterarguments might suggest that the writer could have de-escalated the situation without involving police. However, given that Karen was physically aggressive, the writer's priority was their safety. Also, the writer was in a public area with a neighbor as witness, which adds credibility to their account.\n\nIn conclusion, the writer's actions were a response to an unlawful act committed by Karen. They reported a crime they experienced, which is within their rights. The charges against Karen are a result of her actions, not the writer's. Therefore, the writer is not in the wrong.\n"
