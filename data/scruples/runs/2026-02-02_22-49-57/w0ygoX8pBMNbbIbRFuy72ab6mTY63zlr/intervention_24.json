I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the incident happened when the author was walking their dog. A woman from DxE approached and started talking about dog breeding. The author explained they used a breeder for specific traits. Then the woman accused the author of being selfish and unethical, leading to a physical altercation where she tried to take the dog. The author then reported her, leading to her arrest.\n\nThe key points here are the sequence of events and the author's actions. The woman's behavior escalated from a conversation to a physical push, which is a crime. The author reacted by involving the police, which is a reasonable response to an assault. However, the author might be concerned about whether they overreacted or if the activist's intent was just to protest, not commit a crime.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to consider if the author had other options. Did the author have a duty to de-escalate further, or was calling the police the right choice? Also, the police revoked the protest permit for the group, which might affect others. But the author specifically reported Karen's actions, not the entire protest. Since Karen's actions involved assault (grabbing the leash and pushing), that's a criminal act, so reporting it is justified.\n\nAnother angle: free speech vs. criminal activity. The protest is protected, but committing an assault isn't. The author didn't prevent the protest, just reported the violent act. So the author isn't at fault here. The answer would likely be B (No).\n"
