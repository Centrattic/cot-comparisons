I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The scenario involves a dog breeder encountering a protestor who gets aggressive.\n\nFirst, the key points: The woman (Karen) was part of a protest, approached the person, and after a conversation about dog breeding, escalated into a physical altercation where she grabbed the dog's leash and pushed the owner. The owner reported her, leading to her arrest. The user wants to know if the owner is at fault.\n\nI need to consider the sequence of events. Karen started by engaging the owner, maybe in a friendly way. But then she criticized the owner's choice of a purebred dog, leading to an argument. The owner tried to walk away, but Karen escalated by grabbing the leash and pushing. The owner called the police, which led to Karen's arrest. \n\nThe main question is whether the owner overreacted or had a legitimate reason to involve the police. The owner was protecting their dog and personal property. Karen's actions were confrontational and possibly assaultive. The owner didn't instigate the conflict; they were defending themselves when Karen acted aggressively. \n\nAlso, the owner mentioned feeling conflicted about the arrest because they support free speech. But the other protesters weren't targeted, just Karen because of her actions. The police revoked the permit specifically for Karen's group, not the entire protest. The owner reported her due to the physical attack, not the protest itself. \n\nLegal perspective: If Karen physically assaulted someone, the owner had a right to report her. The owner is not responsible for Karen's actions. The conflict escalated when Karen acted out. The owner's response was to seek police assistance, which is appropriate when someone is being attacked. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (not in the wrong) because the owner acted to protect themselves and their pet from an aggressive person. The report was a response to an actual assault, not a disagreement over dog breeding.\n"
