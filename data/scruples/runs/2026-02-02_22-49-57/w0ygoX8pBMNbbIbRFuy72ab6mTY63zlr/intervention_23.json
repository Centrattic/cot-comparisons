I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and facing a felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was walking their dog and encountered a protestor from DxE. The protestor started a conversation, which escalated when the author mentioned getting the dog from a breeder. The protestor became aggressive, called the author names, grabbed the dog's leash, pushed them, and tried to take the dog. The author and a neighbor witnessed this, and the police were called. The protestor was arrested for assault, and the author is now facing a felony charge for reporting her. The author is questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nNow, the key points here are the actions of both parties. The protestor's actions\u2014grabbing the leash, pushing, and trying to take the dog\u2014could be considered assault, which is a criminal act. The author reported this to the police, which is a responsible action if someone is being physically attacked. The fact that the protestor was part of a group doesn't excuse her actions. The author had a right to defend themselves and their dog. \n\nHowever, the author might be in a position where they initiated the situation by engaging with the protestor. But the main issue here is the physical assault. The police arrested the protestor, which suggests that their actions were indeed criminal. The author's decision to report the incident was in response to being attacked, which is justified. \n\nThe author is now facing a felony charge for reporting the incident, which is concerning. It's possible that the protestor is now suing the author for false reporting, but if the author's account is truthful, they shouldn't be in the wrong. The problem here is whether the author's report was accurate and based on real events. Since the police acted and the protestor was arrested, it implies that the report was valid.\n\nAnother angle is that the protestor's actions were part of a protest, but even so, using physical force to confront someone is not protected under free speech. The author's actions in reporting the assault are within their rights. \n\nThe author might feel conflicted because they didn't want to harm the protestor, but the protestor's actions were the initial problem. The author's response was to defend themselves and their dog, which is understandable. The felony charge seems to be a consequence of the protestor's actions leading to a legal case against the author, but if the author's report was accurate, they aren't in the wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is not in the wrong because they reported a physical assault. The protestor's actions were criminal, and the author had the right to seek police assistance. The fact that the author is now facing a charge is a legal consequence, but the initial act of reporting was justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
