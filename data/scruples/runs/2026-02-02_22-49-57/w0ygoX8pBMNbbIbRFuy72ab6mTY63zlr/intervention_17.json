I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that they reported a vegan activist, Karen, to the police, which led to her arrest and a potential felony charge. The main question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nFirst, the user gives some background. They were walking their dog in a neighborhood with a lot of health-conscious people and vegan restaurants. They encountered a protest by DxE. Karen approached them, started talking about their dog, then escalated to a confrontation about dog breeding. She grabbed the leash, pushed them, and tried to take the dog. The author reported her, leading to her arrest.\n\nSo the key points here are: was the author justified in reporting Karen? Let's break it down. \n\nKaren's actions: She grabbed the leash and pushed the author. That sounds like assault or at least battery. The author mentions that the police arrested her and revoked the protest permit. The police probably saw it as a criminal act because she physically attacked someone during a protest. \n\nThe author's actions: They reported the incident. They didn't provoke Karen first; they were just walking their dog. When Karen became aggressive, the author tried to walk away but she kept following, leading to the physical altercation. Then they went to the police, which is a normal response to an assault. \n\nThe author also mentions feeling bad about other protesters being affected, but the police only revoked Karen's permit, not the entire protest. So it's possible that the police determined Karen was acting outside the bounds of the protest, maybe inciting violence or committing a crime, which is separate from the protest itself.\n\nNow, considering the charges against Karen: fifth-degree felony, possible prison time. Depending on the jurisdiction, assault or battery can be a felony, especially if there's intent to harm. If Karen pushed the author and tried to take the dog, that could be considered a felony. So the author's report led to a justified arrest if Karen committed a crime. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were defending themselves. They didn't initiate the confrontation. They reported a crime. Their motivation might be questioned\u2014maybe they were upset about the vegan comments\u2014but the physical attack is a separate issue. The fact that they had a neighbor witness supports their account. \n\nHowever, one could argue that maybe the author overreacted to Karen's words and escalated the situation. But Karen's physical actions are what led to the arrest. The author didn't provoke the physical attack. Also, they went to the police to report the assault, which is the right thing to do. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. They were a victim of an assault, reported it, and the outcome is a legal consequence for Karen's actions. The author's actions were appropriate in seeking help from the police after being attacked.\n"
