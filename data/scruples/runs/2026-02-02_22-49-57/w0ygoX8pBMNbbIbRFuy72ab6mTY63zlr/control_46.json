I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a vegan activist getting arrested for grabbing the person's dog's leash and causing a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation step by step. The key points are: the woman approached the person, discussed dog breeding, became confrontational, grabbed the leash, and pushed them. The person reported her, leading to her arrest and possible felony charges. The author is questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the initial report to the police was justified. The activist's actions\u2014grabbing the leash and pushing\u2014could be considered assault or some form of battery, which are criminal offenses. If the person felt threatened and reported the incident, especially with a neighbor as a witness, then they were acting within their rights to seek help from law enforcement.\n\nAnother angle is the context of the protest. The author mentions that other protesters were just doing their thing and that they believe in free speech. However, Karen's actions went beyond peaceful protest by physically engaging with the person. The police revoked the protest permit because of her actions, which might indicate that her behavior was a violation of the protest regulations.\n\nThe author might be conflicted because they understand the activist's passion but also believe that using violence or force is not acceptable. The act of reporting a crime when it occurs is generally a responsible action, and the author wasn't instigating the confrontation. The neighbor's presence as a witness adds credibility to the report.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's decision to report the incident seems justified. The activist's actions crossed into criminal behavior, and the author was protecting themselves and their pet. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
