I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist to the police is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation between the author and Karen, a protester from DxE. The key points here are the actions taken by both parties and whether the author's report to the police was justified.\n\nFirst, the author was walking their dog when Karen approached and started a conversation. Karen then made a comment about dogs in shelters being gassed, which the author found uncomfortable. The author explained their breeder choice, but Karen escalated the situation by calling the author names, grabbing the dog's leash, and trying to take the dog. The author and a neighbor intervened, and the police were called. Karen was arrested, and the author is now facing a potential felony charge for reporting her.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspects: Did Karen commit a crime? Assault? Battery? Grabbing someone's leash and trying to take the dog could be considered assault or interference with property. If the police arrested her, that suggests they saw some criminal act. However, the author initiated the report, and the question is whether they were justified in doing so.\n\nBut wait, in some jurisdictions, citizens can report crimes they witness. If Karen's actions were criminal (like assault), then reporting her isn't wrong. However, if the author's report was based on a misunderstanding or if Karen's actions weren't illegal, the author could be at fault. The author mentions feeling torn because other protesters were peaceful, but Karen's actions were separate.\n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling bad about revoking the protest permit. That might imply that the police decided to revoke the permit because Karen's actions disrupted the protest, not the author. So the author's report led to Karen's arrest, which was a direct result of Karen's actions. The author didn't provoke her into acting, so they might not be at fault.\n\nHowever, the author's initial reaction to Karen's comments by walking away and then engaging in conversation could be seen as contributing. But Karen escalated it by grabbing the leash. The police's decision to arrest Karen suggests they agreed with the report. The author is now facing a felony charge, which is a consequence of the legal system's process, not necessarily their fault unless they lied or fabricated the report.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the line is thin. If Karen's actions were indeed criminal, the author did the right thing. But if the author's report was overreacting to a verbal disagreement, that's different. However, given Karen's physical actions (grabbing the leash, trying to take the dog), it's a physical altercation, which is a criminal matter.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting a crime they witnessed. The key here is whether Karen committed a crime, which the police determined by arresting her. The author's report was a legal action based on observing a crime. So the answer is B (No).\n"
