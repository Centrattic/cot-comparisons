I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a felony charge. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author was walking their dog when a woman from a protest group approached them. The woman asked about the dog's breed, then started a conversation that turned confrontational. She accused the author of being selfish for using a breeder, then escalated by grabbing the dog's leash and pushing them. The author and a neighbor intervened, leading to the woman's arrest. Now, the author is facing legal consequences for reporting her.\n\nThe key points here are the actions of the woman and the author's response. The woman's behavior escalated from a conversation to physical aggression\u2014grabbing the leash and pushing. The author's defense is that they were protecting their dog and themselves. The police arrested the woman, which suggests they saw an assault or disorderly conduct.\n\nThe author's dilemma is whether they were justified in reporting the woman. Since the woman used physical force, the author had a right to seek help. Even if the initial interaction was uncomfortable, the escalation to physical contact is a crime. The author didn't provoke the attack; the woman did. The author's actions were a response to an assault, not initiating conflict. \n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling conflicted about the protest, but they differentiated between the individuals and the group. They didn't target the protest but acted when the woman's actions became violent. The police revoking the permit might be because the woman's actions disrupted the protest, but the author's report was about the specific incident.\n\nThe user's point is that the author isn't in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, reporting a violent act is correct. The woman's actions were illegal, regardless of her motives. The author's intention was to protect their dog and themselves. The felony charge against the woman is a result of her actions, not the author's report. So, the author isn't responsible for the woman's legal consequences beyond what's necessary for the crime committed.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They acted appropriately in self-defense and against an assault, and reporting it was justified.\n"
