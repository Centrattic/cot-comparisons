I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing here. So, the situation is that the author was walking their dog when a vegan activist, Karen, approached and started arguing with them about getting a purebred dog from a breeder. Karen then grabbed the leash and tried to take the dog, leading to the police being called and Karen's arrest. The author is now facing a felony charge because of reporting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws regarding animal-related offenses. In many places, stealing a pet or interfering with someone's property could be a criminal act. However, sometimes activism groups might engage in civil disobedience, which is a form of protest that may involve breaking specific laws to highlight an issue. If Karen was part of a protest group like DxE, their actions might be considered part of a broader activist strategy, even if it crosses into illegal territory.\n\nThe key here is whether Karen's action of grabbing the dog's leash and trying to take the dog constitutes a criminal act. If she was trying to rescue the dog based on her beliefs, that could complicate things. However, stealing someone's property (the dog) is generally illegal regardless of intent. The neighbor witnessed the incident, which supports the author's account. \n\nThe author might argue that they acted in self-defense or to protect their property. On the other hand, if the police revoked the protest permit because of Karen's actions, that suggests that her behavior went beyond peaceful protest. The author's initial interaction with Karen was peaceful until Karen escalated it. \n\nAnother point is that the author reported Karen after the incident. If the police determined that Karen committed a crime (like assault or theft), then the author was just following the law. However, if Karen's actions were part of a protest and not criminal, then the author might be seen as overreacting. But since the police arrested Karen, it implies that they saw criminal behavior on her part.\n\nAlso, considering the outcome\u2014Karen facing a felony charge\u2014this might indicate that the legal system agrees with the author's report. However, the author is now facing charges themselves, which might suggest there's a legal argument that the author provoked the situation or that their response was excessive. But given the neighbor's testimony and the immediate police response, the author's case could be strong.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might feel conflicted about punishing someone for activism, but they were acting to protect their dog. The line between protest and criminal behavior can be thin, especially in activist circles. If Karen's actions were intended to disrupt and take the dog, that's different from a peaceful protest. The author's decision to report her was likely based on the immediate threat to their dog and safety.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably wasn't in the wrong. They faced an aggressive situation, there was a witness, and the police agreed with their report. The felony charges against Karen suggest that her actions were indeed illegal. The author's responsibility was to protect their property and themselves, so reporting her was a correct legal response.\n"
