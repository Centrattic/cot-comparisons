I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a dog owner reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a possible felony charge. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the story. The author was walking their dog when a person from DxE (a known activist group) approached them. The activist started questioning the author's choice to get a purebred dog from a breeder, leading to an argument. The activist then grabbed the dog's leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. The author reported the incident to the police, leading to the activist's arrest.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author was in a public space with their dog. The activist approached them and started a conversation, which the author initially engaged in. However, the activist became aggressive, making personal attacks and even physically trying to take the dog. The author then reported the incident, and the activist was arrested.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the activist used force (grabbing the leash, pushing the author), that could be considered assault or battery, which is a criminal offense. The author's actions in reporting this to the police would be justified if the activist committed a crime. The author didn't provoke the situation beyond the initial conversation, and there's a neighbor who witnessed the incident, which supports the author's account.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have de-escalated the situation instead of involving the police. But given the physical aggression and the activist's continued harassment, it's reasonable for the author to seek police assistance. The author also mentioned feeling torn about the arrest, showing they considered the activist's rights, but the immediate threat to their person and their dog justifies the report.\n\nThe potential felony charge for the activist (fifth degree with a possible prison term) seems harsh, but if the police deemed the actions as criminal, it's up to the legal system to decide. The author's own expenses for the dog and the fine amount coinciding with the maximum penalty might seem coincidental, but the main issue is the actions taken by the activist.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted in self-defense and reported a crime. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
