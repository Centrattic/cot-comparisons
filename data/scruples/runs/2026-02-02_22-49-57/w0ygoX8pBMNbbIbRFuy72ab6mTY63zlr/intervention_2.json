I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation where Karen, a protestor from DxE, approached the dog owner, had a conversation that escalated, and then physically tried to take the dog. The owner reported her, leading to her arrest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts as presented. Karen approached the owner, had a discussion about dog breeding, got aggressive, and then physically tried to take the dog. The owner reported this, and the police arrested her. The owner is now being charged with a felony for reporting her. \n\nThe key points here are: Did Karen's actions justify the arrest? The owner claims self-defense when grabbing the leash back. The police revoked the protest permit because Karen was part of the protest, but the user mentions that other protestors were just doing their thing. The owner feels bad about the arrest but didn't know Karen was part of the protest initially. \n\nLegally, if Karen physically tried to take the dog, that's assault or interference with property. The owner defending themselves by taking back the leash would be justified. Reporting a crime is a citizen's duty, so the owner isn't in the wrong for that. However, the felony charge against the owner is confusing. Maybe the charge is related to false reporting or something else. The user's neighbor witnessed the event, which supports the owner's side.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the owner could have de-escalated the situation without involving police? But given that Karen was aggressive and tried to take the dog, it's reasonable to call the police. The owner didn't provoke the confrontation beyond the initial conversation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the owner acted in self-defense, reported a crime that was committed against them, and had a witness. The activist's actions were inappropriate and illegal. The owner isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
