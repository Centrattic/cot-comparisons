I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to understand the situation as described. The user was walking their dog when they encountered a protestor from DxE. The protestor started talking to them about their dog, then escalated the conversation by making a comment about dogs in shelters. The author explained their breeder choice, and the protestor became aggressive, grabbing the leash and trying to take the dog. The author and a neighbor intervened, and the police were called, leading to the protestor's arrest.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The key points here would be about the use of force and the appropriateness of reporting the protestor. The protestor's actions\u2014grabbing the leash and pushing the author\u2014are physical acts that could be considered assault or battery, depending on the jurisdiction. If the police arrested her, they likely saw it as a criminal act. The author's actions were to defend themselves and their dog, which seems reasonable. They didn't provoke the situation initially.\n\nHowever, some might argue that engaging with a protestor in a public demonstration area could be seen as interacting in a context where tensions might rise. But the protestor's actions were unprovoked aggression towards the author and their property (the dog). The author was just walking their dog and trying to de-escalate when possible. Reporting a crime to the police is a civic duty, especially when there's a threat of harm.\n\nThe user is concerned that maybe the protestor was just passionate and not deserving of jail, but the physical violence done here is a separate issue from the protest itself. The author didn't start the conflict and acted to protect themselves and their dog. So, I think the author is not in the wrong here. Their actions were defensive and appropriate given the situation. The answer should be B.\n"
