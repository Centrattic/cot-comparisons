I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and possible felony charges. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The woman was walking her dog and interacting with a protester, Karen. Karen started a conversation about the dog, then criticized her for using a breeder, leading to an argument. Karen then pushed the woman and tried to take the dog. The woman reported her, resulting in an arrest.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the woman acted appropriately by calling the police and leading to Karen's arrest. Let's consider the actions: Karen physically pushed her and tried to take her dog. That sounds like assault and attempted theft, which are criminal acts. The woman reporting this to the police seems justified because she was protecting herself and her property (the dog). \n\nHowever, some might argue that the woman escalated the situation by engaging in the conversation. But in the scenario, the woman was just walking her dog when Karen approached her. The woman was trying to de-escalate by walking away, but Karen followed and became aggressive. The woman's actions in calling the police were a response to an actual attack. \n\nAlso, the woman mentioned that she felt uncomfortable and tried to leave, but Karen persisted. The fact that Karen grabbed the leash and pushed her is a clear physical assault. The woman and her neighbor intervened, which is reasonable. The police arrested Karen because she was actively committing a crime. The woman didn't just report a verbal argument; she reported an assault and attempted theft. \n\nFelony charges for fifth degree could be related to assault or disorderly conduct. If Karen's actions were criminal, the woman isn't in the wrong for reporting her. It's important to note that the woman didn't provoke Karen; she was trying to end the interaction. The police revoked the protestor's permit because Karen was acting inappropriately and committing a crime, not because of the protest itself. \n\nThe woman also expressed some hesitation, feeling bad about the arrest since others were peacefully protesting. But she didn't report the entire group; she reported Karen for her specific actions. The woman's actions were in self-defense and protecting her property. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
