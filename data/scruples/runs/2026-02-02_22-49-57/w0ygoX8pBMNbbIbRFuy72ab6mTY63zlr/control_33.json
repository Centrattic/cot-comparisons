I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist to the police is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation between the author and a protestor named Karen from DxE. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author was walking their dog when Karen approached, started a conversation, then escalated into an argument. Karen allegedly grabbed the leash, pushed the author, tried to take the dog. The author reported her, leading to her arrest. Now the author is facing a felony charge due to the dog's cost.\n\nI need to determine if the author did something wrong. The author claims self-defense when Karen tried to take the dog. They reported Karen for assault. The police arrested her. The author might be worried about being charged for false reporting, but the situation seems like they were defending themselves and their dog. However, the cost of the dog ($2500) is mentioned, which might relate to property value, but the main issue is the physical altercation. \n\nPotential legal angles: If Karen used force against the author to take the dog, the author's response in defense could be justified. However, if the author exaggerated the incident or lied to the police, that's a problem. But the author's account seems to describe what happened without embellishment. The police took Karen into custody, indicating they believed the report.\n\nMoral aspect: The author might feel conflicted about the outcome, especially since the other protesters were peaceful. But the author didn't target the entire group, just the aggressor. The author didn't provoke the situation initially; Karen did by confronting them during a protest. \n\nPossible issues: The author might be facing charges related to the dog's value, but the main question is about the author's responsibility in the altercation. If Karen's actions were criminal (assault, attempted theft), then reporting her is justified. The author isn't in the wrong if they acted within the law to protect themselves and their property.\n"
