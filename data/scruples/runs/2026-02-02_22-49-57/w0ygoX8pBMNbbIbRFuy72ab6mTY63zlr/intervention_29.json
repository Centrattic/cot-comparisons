I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist (Karen) to the police is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation where Karen grabbed the person's dog leash and tried to take the dog. The person then reported her, leading to her arrest and a possible felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The person was walking their dog in a neighborhood with a vegan bistro and DxE protesters. Karen approached, started a conversation about the dog, then escalated by accusing the person of being selfish for getting a purebred from a breeder. The person tried to leave, but Karen followed, got aggressive, called them names, grabbed the leash, pushed them, and tried to run with the dog. A neighbor helped, and the police were called. Karen was arrested, and the protest's permit was revoked.\n\nNow, the key points here are the person's actions versus Karen's. The person reports the incident to the police because they were physically attacked, their dog was involved, and a neighbor witnessed it. The person wasn't trying to suppress free speech; they just reported a crime. They seem to have acted in self-defense and to protect their dog. \n\nPossible angles where the person might be wrong: Did they overreact? Maybe they shouldn't have called the police over a verbal confrontation? But Karen's actions included physical aggression (grabbing the leash, pushing), which justifies involving law enforcement. Also, the person was trying to leave and was physically assaulted. \n\nAnother point: The person mentions feeling a bit torn because they believe in free speech, but Karen was part of a protest that had a permit. However, Karen's actions were not peaceful protest; she was violent. The police revoked the permit because of her actions, which might be an overreaction from the authorities, but the person didn't cause that. \n\nIs the person in the wrong? They followed through with the report because of a legitimate threat to their safety and their dog's. The felony charge against Karen might be for assault or battery. The person's actions were in self-defense and reporting a crime. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
