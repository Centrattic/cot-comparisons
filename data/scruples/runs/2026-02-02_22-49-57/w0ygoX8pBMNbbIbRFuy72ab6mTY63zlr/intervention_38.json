I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who reported the vegan activist to the police was in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation where the activist, Karen, approached the dog owner and escalated the interaction by grabbing the dog's leash and pushing them. The dog owner then reported her, leading to her arrest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts as presented. The owner was walking their dog, a purebred from a breeder, which Karen criticized. Karen then accused the owner of being selfish and called her names, leading to a physical grab of the leash and a push. The owner then reported this to the police, resulting in Karen's arrest. The owner feels conflicted because they believe in free speech but also think Karen might face a felony charge.\n\nThe key points here are whether the owner acted appropriately in reporting Karen. The owner was a victim of assault (pushed and leash grabbed) and had a neighbor who witnessed the event. The police responded and arrested Karen after hearing both sides. The owner didn't initiate the conflict; Karen did. The owner was trying to walk away and had to defend themselves and their dog.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any ambiguity. The owner admitted they weren't vegan but limit meat consumption, which might show they weren't entirely hostile. Karen's actions were unprovoked aggression. The owner's response was to seek police help, which is a standard reaction to assault. The owner also mentioned not wanting to report her but did because of the assault. The charge against Karen might be justified based on assault laws, especially if there's a witness (the neighbor) corroborating the story.\n\nIs there any fault on the owner's part? The owner didn't provoke Karen. They answered her questions but set boundaries when she became aggressive. The owner didn't physically retaliate beyond reclaiming the leash. The police were called appropriately. So, it seems the owner acted within their rights to protect themselves and their dog. The felony charge against Karen might be for assault, which is a valid offense. The owner's intent was to report a crime, not to target someone for their beliefs. The owner's actions don't seem to be in the wrong here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
