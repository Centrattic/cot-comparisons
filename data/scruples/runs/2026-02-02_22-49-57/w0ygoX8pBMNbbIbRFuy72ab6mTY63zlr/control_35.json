I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist to the police is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the incident: The person was walking their dog when a protester approached. The protester started a conversation, then escalated by making a comment about dogs in shelters. The user responds, then the protester becomes aggressive, grabs the dog's leash, pushes the user, and tries to take the dog. The user calls the police, leading to the protester's arrest. The user is now facing a court case and is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the key points here are the actions of the protester. The user claims that the protester tried to grab the dog, pushed them, and was being aggressive. Assault is a criminal offense, so reporting that would be justified. However, the user also mentioned that they felt bad because the other protesters were peaceful. \n\nThe question is about whether the user is at fault. The main factors here are whether the protester's actions constituted a crime (assault, maybe) and whether the user had a reasonable response. If the protester tried to take the dog, that's a clear case of attempted theft or assault. The user's action of reporting this to the police and having her arrested would be justified in self-defense and protecting their property (the dog). \n\nPossible counterarguments: Was the user provoked? They were being harassed by the protester. However, the escalation happened when the protester grabbed the leash and pushed the user. The user's response was to call the police, which is standard. The user also mentions that they were scared and unsure about the legal consequences for the protester but felt justified in the context of self-defense.\n\nIn terms of legal responsibility, if the protester committed an assault, the user has a right to report it. The user isn't at fault here because they acted to protect themselves and their dog. Even though they might feel bad about the outcome, the initial act of reporting a crime is not wrong. The other protesters weren't targeted, so the user isn't responsible for the broader protest's actions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
