I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a potential felony charge.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was walking their dog when a protester, Karen, approached. There was a disagreement about purebred dogs and animal shelters. Karen escalated the situation by grabbing the dog's leash, pushing the author, and trying to take the dog. The author called the police, and Karen was arrested. The author is now facing a court date and possible charges themselves.\n\nSo, the key points here are the actions of both parties. The author is reporting a physical assault. Even though the initial conversation might have been about their views on dogs, the critical part is Karen's physical actions. Grabbing someone's leash and pushing them could be considered assault or battery, depending on the jurisdiction. The police arrested her, which suggests they found probable cause.\n\nThe author's intent was to report the assault. They didn't provoke Karen first; they were trying to walk away when she escalated. The neighbor witnessed the incident, which supports the author's account. The fact that Karen was part of a protest but didn't have a permit revoked by the police\u2014wait, actually the police revoked the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them. That might mean the protest was legal, but Karen's individual actions were problematic. The author didn't target the entire group, just the woman who attacked them.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say the author shouldn't have reported her because it was a disagreement about animal ethics. But the line was crossed when physical violence occurred. The author's right to protect themselves and their property (the dog) is important. Also, the police took action, indicating that Karen's actions were criminal.\n\nAnother angle: The author might be facing charges because they reported the incident. But since Karen was the aggressor, the author acted in self-defense. The outcome for the author in court would depend on the evidence, but the act of reporting a crime isn't inherently wrong. The author might have a legal defense here.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is not in the wrong because they reported a criminal act (assault) after being physically attacked. The initial conversation was a disagreement, but the escalation was due to Karen's actions. The author had the right to seek police assistance when confronted with violence.\n"
