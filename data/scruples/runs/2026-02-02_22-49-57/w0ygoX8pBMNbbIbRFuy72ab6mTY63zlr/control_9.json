I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a possible felony charge. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the sequence of events. The author was walking their dog when a woman from DxE, Karen, started talking to them. Karen asked about the dog's breed, then brought up the issue of shelter dogs being gassed. The author explains they chose a breeder for specific traits. Then Karen accused them of being selfish, followed them, called them names, grabbed the leash, pushed them, and tried to take the dog. The author got help from a neighbor and reported the incident to the police, resulting in Karen's arrest. The police revoked the DxE permit because of her actions.\n\nNow, the key points here are whether the author's actions were justified in reporting Karen. The police arrested Karen for the assault and harassment, which suggests that her actions were criminal. If the author was a victim of assault (pushing and trying to take the dog), then reporting it would be appropriate. The neighbor's presence as a witness adds credibility to the author's account.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue about the motivation. The author mentions feeling uncomfortable and maybe a bit defensive about their breeder choice, but Karen escalated the situation by physically attacking. The author didn't provoke her beyond explaining their decision. The police's involvement leading to an arrest indicates that Karen's actions were considered criminal, so the author's report was valid.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author had a vendetta or if Karen's actions weren't actually criminal, then it might be different. But given that the police took action and revoked the permit, it seems like the author was justified. The author also felt conflicted, indicating they didn't want to harm the other protesters just because of one person's actions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author wasn't in the wrong. They were reacting to an assault and trying to protect their dog. The answer should be B.\n"
