I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the user is in the wrong here. The situation involves a vegan activist, Karen, who confronted the user about getting a purebred dog from a breeder. The interaction escalated into a physical altercation where Karen tried to take the dog and ended up getting arrested. The user is now facing a felony charge because of reporting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user was walking their dog in a public area where a protest was happening. Karen approached them, started a conversation, and then escalated it by making accusations about dog shelters and breeders. The user claims they explained their reasons for using a breeder, but Karen kept following them, yelling, and eventually tried to take the dog. The user then called the police, leading to Karen's arrest.\n\nThe key points here are the escalation of conflict. Was Karen's behavior justified? She approached the user, engaged in a conversation, and then made aggressive comments. The user tried to walk away but Karen continued to follow and harass them. When the user tried to leave, Karen physically grabbed the leash and tried to take the dog. That's a clear physical threat and assault.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if someone attempts to take another person's pet by force, that's a criminal act. The user acted in self-defense and to protect their property (the dog). Reporting Karen to the police was necessary to stop the immediate threat. The user didn't instigate the confrontation; they were responding to Karen's aggressive actions.\n\nHowever, the user might be questioned about why they didn't try to de-escalate the situation before involving the police. But given that Karen was trying to take the dog, which is a clear act of theft or assault, the user had a right to involve authorities. The police's decision to revoke the protest permit for Karen's group might be a matter of public order, but the user's actions were in defense of their property and personal safety.\n\nThe user also mentions feeling conflicted about the other protesters, but that's separate from the specific incident with Karen. The user didn't target the entire group, just the individual who physically attacked them.\n\nIn terms of legal responsibility, the user isn't the one who committed an assault or attempted theft. Karen's actions were criminal, and the user took appropriate steps to report it. The user isn't in the wrong here because they responded to an unlawful act by a third party.\n"
