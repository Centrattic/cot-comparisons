I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation where Karen, a protestor from DxE, approached the person while they were walking their dog. The interaction escalated when Karen grabbed the dog's leash and tried to take the dog, leading to her arrest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The key here is whether the person had a valid reason to report Karen. The police arrested her, and she's facing a felony charge. The act of grabbing someone's dog and trying to take it could be considered assault or theft, depending on the jurisdiction. The fact that there's a neighbor who witnessed the incident supports the person's side.\n\nThe person mentions they didn't know Karen was part of the protest initially. Karen's actions were aggressive and possibly illegal, so reporting it to the police was a reasonable response. The user is questioning if they did the right thing by reporting her, especially since they mention feeling torn about the arrest affecting the protest's free speech. However, free speech doesn't protect illegal actions. The police revoked the permit because Karen's actions were not peaceful protest but actual criminal behavior.\n\nThe user also mentions the cost of the dog and the potential legal consequences for Karen. That could be a factor in the court case, showing the value of the property involved. The person didn't provoke the situation; they were walking their dog and trying to leave when Karen followed and escalated it.\n\nIt seems like the person acted in self-defense and to protect their property (the dog). The police were involved, and there's a court date, so the legal system is handling it. The user isn't in the wrong for reporting a crime. However, there might be a nuance if the person's initial interaction was respectful. But given the escalation by Karen, the user did the right thing.\n"
