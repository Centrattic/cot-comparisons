I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was walking their dog in a neighborhood where a DxE (Direct Action Everywhere) protest was happening. The woman, Karen, approached the author and ended up getting arrested after a confrontation. The author is now facing a court date and is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was approached by Karen, who was part of the protest but not obviously so. Karen started a conversation about the dog being a purebred, mentioned that millions of dogs get gassed in shelters. The author tried to walk away, but Karen followed, called them names, and physically grabbed the dog's leash. The author and a neighbor then went to the police, leading to Karen's arrest. The author is upset because they support free speech and only reported Karen's aggressive actions, not the protest itself.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting Karen. Let's break it down. Did the author have a valid reason to report the incident? Karen grabbed the leash and pushed the author, which could be considered assault or theft. If the author and neighbor witnessed this, then reporting it to the police is a reasonable response. The author didn't provoke the situation; they were just walking their dog. Karen's actions were aggressive and possibly illegal, so the author acting in self-defense and seeking help from the police seems justified.\n\nThe author also mentions that they were aware of the purebred issue but chose a breeder for specific traits. Karen's reaction seems to be based on her activism against purebred breeding, but that doesn't make her actions acceptable. Even if someone is passionate about their cause, using physical force and harassment is not okay. The police revoked the protest permit, which might be because Karen's actions were outside the bounds of protected free speech. If the protest was peaceful, but one individual committed a crime, the author reporting that individual isn't wrong.\n\nThe author is facing a felony charge themselves, which is interesting. Maybe Karen is retaliating, or there's a charge related to the report. However, the details about the author's potential charges are a bit unclear. The key is that the author was acting within their rights to report a crime. The author didn't instigate the situation; they were victims of harassment and possible assault. The neighbor's presence supports the author's account, so they have a credible witness.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they responded appropriately to an aggressive and illegal act. Reporting it to the police is the right thing to do, especially when personal safety is involved. Free speech doesn't extend to physical violence, so the author isn't at fault for stopping that. The other protesters weren't involved, so the author didn't harm the entire protest, just the individual who attacked them.\n"
