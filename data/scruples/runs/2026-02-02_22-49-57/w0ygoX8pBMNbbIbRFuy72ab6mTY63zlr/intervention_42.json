I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a confrontation between the author and a vegan activist, Karen, during a protest. The key points are that Karen approached the author, engaged in a conversation about her dog, then escalated by grabbing the leash and pushing the author. The author reported her, leading to her arrest and potential felony charges.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Assault is typically a criminal offense. If Karen physically assaulted the author by pushing her and trying to take the dog, then that's a valid reason for the police to arrest her. The author didn't provoke the physical contact; they were just walking their dog. So from a legal standpoint, the author's actions in reporting the assault seem justified.\n\nEthically, the author might feel conflicted because they don't want to harm the activist's free speech rights. However, the other protesters weren't targeted; only Karen, who crossed the line by using violence. The author didn't start the conflict and was trying to walk away. Reporting a crime that was committed against them is a responsible action.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author could have avoided the situation by not engaging with Karen. But the conversation started innocently when Karen asked about the dog. The author didn't know Karen was part of the protest at first. The escalation was due to Karen's aggressive actions, not the author's provocation.\n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling torn because they respect free speech. However, the other protesters weren't harmed or arrested, indicating that only the person who committed an illegal act was held accountable. The author didn't target the group but an individual who violated the law.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were in self-defense and reporting a crime. They didn't act out of malice but to protect themselves and their dog. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
