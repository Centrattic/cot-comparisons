I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for reporting the vegan activist to the police and getting her arrested. The user wants a yes or no answer, A or B.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author was walking their dog in a neighborhood, encountered a woman from DxE (Direct Action Everywhere) protesting. The woman, Karen, initially complimented the dog, then started talking about shelter dogs being gassed. The author explained they used a breeder for specific traits. Karen then accused the author of being selfish, called her names, tried to grab the dog's leash, pushed her, and tried to take the puppy. The author and a neighbor intervened, called the police, and Karen was arrested. The author is now facing a felony charge from the incident because they reported her. They're questioning if they're at fault.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did Karen's actions constitute a criminal offense? The author claims she pushed her and tried to take the dog. Assault would typically involve some form of physical contact that's unlawful. Grabbing the leash and pushing could be assault or battery, depending on jurisdiction. The police arrested her, which suggests they saw it as a criminal act. The author might not be at fault here if Karen's actions were indeed criminal. \n\nBut wait, the author had a difference of opinion, and the conversation escalated. Did the author provoke it? They say they were walking away, Karen followed, and then she started yelling and tried to take the dog. The author's actions seem defensive. However, if the author reported Karen, leading to her arrest, and now the author is facing charges, maybe it's a case of the author retaliating or overreacting? \n\nAlso, the author mentions that Karen was part of a protest group. The police revoked their protest permit because of Karen's actions. The author might not have intended to disrupt the protest but acted in self-defense. However, if the author is facing a felony charge, perhaps because Karen is suing or there's a wrongful arrest issue. The author might be in the wrong if they used excessive force or if the police determined that Karen wasn't actually committing a crime. But the police did arrest her, which implies that they saw criminal conduct. \n\nAnother angle: The author's intent. They didn't start the conflict; Karen did. The author was trying to remove themselves from the conversation when Karen escalated it. The author's response was to involve the police, which is a standard procedure. If the police agreed that Karen's actions were criminal, then the author is justified. However, if the situation was a misunderstanding, the author might share some responsibility. But given the police's action, it's more likely the author isn't at fault. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently, like not involving the police if it was a minor dispute. However, given that there was physical assault (pushing and trying to take the dog), calling the police was appropriate. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
