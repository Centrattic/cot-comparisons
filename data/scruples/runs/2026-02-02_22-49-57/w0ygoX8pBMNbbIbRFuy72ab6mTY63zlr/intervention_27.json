I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who reported Karen to the police is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation between the author and a vegan activist, Karen.\n\nFirst, the author was walking their dog when Karen approached. She started talking about dog euthanasia in shelters, then escalated by calling the author names and trying to take the dog. The author claims Karen pushed them and grabbed the leash. The police were called, Karen was arrested, and now the author is facing a felony charge from Karen.\n\nThe key points here are: Did Karen's actions justify the arrest? The author reported her for assault, so the police need to determine if there was an actual crime. The author's version says Karen pushed them and tried to take the dog, which could be assault. Karen's side isn't known, but if she was part of a protest, maybe she was acting on passion, but physical contact could still be a crime.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they felt uncomfortable but walked away initially. Karen followed and escalated. The author then called the police after the physical altercation. The author might be concerned about being wrong if the police found Karen's actions just part of protest. However, if Karen used force, that's a separate issue from free speech.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if Karen indeed committed a crime. But if Karen's actions were part of a protest and not an assault, the author could be overreacting. However, since the police arrested Karen, it suggests they saw a crime. The author's intent was to report a crime, not to target the protest. The neighbor's testimony supports the author's account.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions were in self-defense and reporting a crime. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
