I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for reporting a vegan activist who got arrested. The situation involves a confrontation where the activist, Karen, tried to take the person's dog and was aggressive.\n\nFirst, the user was walking their dog in a public place. Karen approached, had a conversation, then got confrontational. She accused them of being selfish for getting a purebred and then physically grabbed the dog's leash. The user called the police, and Karen was arrested.\n\nNow, to determine if the user is in the wrong. Legally, if someone uses force or tries to take your property (the dog, which is considered property), you have the right to protect it. The user didn't provoke Karen first; it seems like Karen escalated the situation. The police arrested her, and the user might have a case for assault or theft attempt. \n\nEthically, the user was defending their dog. They didn't initiate the conflict. Reporting a crime when it happens is usually the right thing to do. The user also mentioned feeling conflicted about the arrest affecting the protest group, but they didn't target the whole group, just Karen's actions. \n\nPossible issues: Did the user have a duty to de-escalate? Maybe, but after Karen grabbed the dog and pushed them, self-defense and protecting property would allow for reporting. Also, the user didn't attack first; they called the police. \n\nThe answer seems to be B (not in the wrong), as they acted in self-defense and protected their property. The activist's actions were aggressive and illegal, so reporting her is justified. The user might feel guilty, but legally and ethically, they're in the right.\n"
