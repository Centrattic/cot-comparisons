I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the person was walking their dog and encountered a protester, Karen. They had a conversation where Karen started questioning their choice of getting a purebred dog from a breeder. The user explained they used a reputable breeder, but Karen got aggressive, called them names, and even tried to take the dog's leash, leading to a physical altercation with the neighbor's help. The user then reported her to the police, resulting in her arrest and a possible felony charge.\n\nNow, the key points here are the escalation of the conflict. Karen's actions went beyond just protesting or having a discussion. She physically tried to take the dog, which could be considered assault or attempted theft. The user acted in self-defense when confronted with an aggressive situation. Reporting the incident to the police was a responsible action, especially since there was a physical attack involved. The user also mentioned that other protesters were not involved, so they didn't report the entire group.\n\nHowever, the user might be concerned about the charges being too harsh, like a felony. But given that Karen physically assaulted them, the police might have a valid reason for the charges. The user's initial interaction was polite, but Karen escalated things. The user's decision to involve the authorities was justified to ensure their safety and the dog's safety.\n\nOn the other hand, the user should consider if there was any provocation from their side. The user was walking their dog, and Karen approached them. The user stood their ground, and when attacked, they defended themselves. The police were involved promptly. The user didn't instigate the conflict; they were reacting to an aggressive person. \n\nIn summary, the user acted in self-defense and took appropriate steps to address an assault. Reporting the incident was the right thing to do. The charges against Karen might be a legal matter, but the user isn't in the wrong for reporting a violent act. So the answer should be B.\n"
