I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person was walking their dog when a vegan activist from DxE accosted them, leading to a confrontation where the activist tried to take the dog, got arrested, and now the author is facing a court case.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author bought their dog from a breeder, which is a choice they made after considering the breeder's reputation. The activist, Karen, starts a conversation, then accuses the author of contributing to the problem of shelter dogs being euthanized. The author responds that they chose a breeder for specific traits and uses a reputable one. Then, Karen gets aggressive, calls the author names, tries to grab the dog, and ends up getting arrested. The author reported her to the police, leading to her arrest and potential felony charge.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did the author act appropriately in reporting Karen? Was Karen's action a criminal offense? Was the author justified in involving the police?\n\nFrom the description, Karen pushed the author and tried to take the dog. Assault and attempted theft are criminal acts. The author and neighbor witnessed this and reported it. The police arrested Karen, which suggests that their actions were within the law. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The protest was about veganism and animal rights, but Karen's actions went beyond peaceful protest. She physically confronted the author, which is illegal regardless of the cause. The author didn't start the confrontation; they were defending their dog and themselves. The police revoked the protest permit because of Karen's actions, which indicates that the protest might have been in violation of their permit terms due to her behavior.\n\nThe author might feel conflicted because they understand free speech and protest rights, but when someone's actions cross into violence or property theft, it's their right to seek legal recourse. The author didn't instigate the conflict; they were victims of an aggressive act. Reporting a crime is a citizen's duty, so in that sense, the author was justified.\n\nBut there's also the question of whether the author's actions were proportionate. They didn't provoke Karen, and the police's response was appropriate. The court case now involves the author possibly facing charges, but given that Karen was the aggressor, it's unlikely the author is in the wrong. The author's main mistake might have been not de-escalating the situation earlier, but once violence occurred, reporting it was correct.\n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They were defending themselves and their dog from an aggressive individual whose actions were criminal. The answer should be B.\n"
