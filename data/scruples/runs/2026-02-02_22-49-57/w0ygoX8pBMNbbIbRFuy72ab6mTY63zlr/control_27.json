I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a possible felony charge. The situation involves the author walking their dog and getting into a confrontation with a protestor from DxE. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author was approached by Karen, who started a conversation about the dog. Then Karen brought up the issue of dogs being gassed in shelters, which made the author uncomfortable. The author tried to leave but Karen followed, leading to an argument where Karen grabbed the leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. The author called the police, and Karen was arrested. The police revoked the protest permit because of Karen's actions.\n\nNow, the key points here are whether the author did something wrong. The author reported a crime after being physically assaulted. The police intervened, and Karen was arrested. The author's actions resulted in a possible felony for Karen, including jail time and fines. \n\nThe user wants to know if the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were justified. The author was defending themselves against an attack. The police responded appropriately, and Karen's actions (grabbing the leash, pushing) could be considered assault. The author didn't instigate the conflict; they were trying to walk away. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author reported the incident to the police, leading to Karen's arrest. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's intent was to report an assault. The police handled the situation, so the author isn't the one who should be in trouble. \n\nPossible counterarguments could be that the author escalated the situation, but the main conflict was initiated by Karen. The author tried to de-escalate by walking away, but Karen continued. The author's actions in calling the police were a direct response to being attacked. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author acted in self-defense and reported a crime. Unless there's evidence of the author provoking the situation, which isn't indicated here, they aren't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
