I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is walking their dog when they encounter a vegan activist, Karen, from DxE. She starts questioning them about their dog's breed, then accuses them of being selfish for getting a purebred from a breeder. The conversation escalates when Karen grabs the dog's leash and pushes the author. The author then reports her to the police, leading to her arrest and potential felony charges.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. If Karen physically assaulted the author by grabbing the leash and pushing them, that's a criminal act. In most jurisdictions, assault and battery are criminal offenses. The author's decision to report this would be justified because they were a victim of an attack. The police arresting her seems appropriate if she committed a crime.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The author was in a public space, walking their dog, and was approached by someone who became aggressive. The author didn't provoke the situation; they were trying to leave when Karen escalated things. The act of reporting a crime to the authorities is a civic duty. Even if the author felt conflicted about the protest, their primary responsibility was to their own safety and the safety of others.\n\nThere's also the context of the protest. The user mentions that other protesters were just doing their thing, and the police only revoked the permit for Karen's group because of her actions. The author didn't target the entire protest but specifically reported Karen for her aggressive behavior. That seems fair because the other protesters weren't involved in the assault.\n\nThe user is worried about Karen facing felony charges. The facts here are that she physically attacked someone, which can indeed be a felony depending on the severity and local laws. The potential charges mentioned (felony fifth degree, prison time, fines) align with assault charges. The author's role was as a victim reporting a crime, which is not in the wrong.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if the author's initial interaction was entirely without fault. The user did talk to Karen when she first approached, but Karen's aggressive behavior followed. There's no indication the user was rude first beyond telling Karen to leave them alone when asked. The push and leash grabbing were initiated by Karen, so the author's response was defensive.\n\nThe user might feel some guilt because they support free speech, but that doesn't mean they have to tolerate criminal behavior. The arrest was specific to Karen's actions, not the protest itself. The user's report was about a crime, not the protest's message.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted appropriately by reporting a criminal act. They didn't instigate the conflict and were defending themselves against assault. The charges against Karen are a result of her actions, not the author's. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
