I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported the vegan activist to the police is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being approached by Karen, a protestor from DxE, who got confrontational and physically tried to take the author's dog. The author reported her, leading to her arrest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Karen approached the author during a protest. She started with a friendly question about the dog but then escalated by making a comment about shelter dogs, followed by accusing the author of selfishness. The author tried to walk away but Karen followed, got aggressive, called names, grabbed the leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. The police were called, and Karen was arrested.\n\nNow, the key legal points here are assault and battery. In many jurisdictions, assault is an unlawful attempt to injure someone, and battery is the actual harmful or offensive contact. Karen grabbing the leash and pushing the author would likely constitute both. The author reporting this to the police was a legitimate response to an assault. The police arresting her for disorderly conduct or a similar charge might be appropriate if there was a breach of protest permits, but the physical altercation is the main issue here.\n\nNext, the author's motivations. They mention feeling uncomfortable and trying to leave, but Karen escalated the situation. The author didn't provoke it; they were trying to be respectful initially. The act of reporting a crime isn't inherently wrong, especially when there's a threat to personal safety. The author also mentions regret about the other protestors, indicating they respect free speech but also their safety.\n\nThe author might be questioning if they overreacted, but given the physical aggression, it's justified to report. The possible felony charge against Karen (like fifth-degree felony) might be related to assault or disorderly conduct. The author's actions were in self-defense and protecting their dog. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
