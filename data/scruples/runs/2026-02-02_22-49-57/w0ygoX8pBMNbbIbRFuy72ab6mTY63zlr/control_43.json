I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves reporting a vegan activist to the police, which led to her arrest and a potential felony charge. The main question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts provided. The author was walking their dog when a woman from a protest group, DxE, approached them. The woman started a conversation about the dog's breed and then escalated into an argument about breeding dogs, with the woman accusing the author of being selfish and enslaving the dog. The situation escalated to the woman grabbing the leash and trying to take the dog, leading the author to call the police.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the woman's actions of grabbing the leash and trying to take the dog. That seems like a physical altercation or assault. The author reported her, leading to an arrest. Now, the author is facing a court case. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if someone attempts to take another person's property (in this case, the dog) by force, that's likely a crime. The author's action of reporting a crime that was committed against them is generally within their rights. However, there might be nuances. For example, did the author provoke the situation? The woman was part of a protest group, but she approached the author first. The conversation seems to have started amicably but then turned confrontational when the woman accused the author of unethical breeding.\n\nThe author's response when the woman started yelling and grabbing the leash was to involve the police. If the woman's actions were indeed criminal (assault, theft attempt), then reporting her is justified. However, if the woman's actions were protected speech or part of a protest, maybe the author overreacted. But grabbing someone's dog and trying to take it isn't just speech\u2014it's physical conduct that could be criminal.\n\nAnother angle: the author might be facing a charge because the woman could claim false reporting or something similar. The author's fear of a felony charge might stem from the woman's side of the story. But the police arrested her, so they likely saw the incident as criminal. The neighbor witnessed the event, which supports the author's account.\n\nEthically, the author might feel conflicted about reporting a protestor, especially if they aren't fully in agreement with the protest's message. However, the act of reporting a crime is separate from the protest's beliefs. The woman's actions were separate from the protest's peaceful activities, and the author didn't target the entire group but an individual who committed a crime.\n\nPossible issues to consider: Was there any escalation from the author's side? The author did mention that when the woman started yelling, they kept walking away and asked her to leave them alone. The woman then escalated by grabbing the leash. The author didn't provoke the physical altercation. \n\nIn conclusion, the author acted in self-defense and to protect their property (the dog) by reporting a criminal act. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong.\n"
