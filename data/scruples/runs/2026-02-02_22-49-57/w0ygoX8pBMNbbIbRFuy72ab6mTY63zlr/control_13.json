I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they reported a vegan activist, Karen, to the police after she got into an argument with them and tried to take their dog. The user wants to know if they're at fault for causing Karen's arrest and facing a felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the events as described. The author was walking their dog when Karen approached and started a conversation. Karen then made a comment about dogs being gassed in shelters, which the author knew but explained their breeder choice. The author walked away, but Karen followed and started yelling, called them names, and tried to take the dog. The author's neighbor saw it happen. They reported it, and Karen was arrested.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did Karen commit a crime? The author claims she pushed them and tried to take the dog. If that's true, then assault and attempted theft could be applicable. The author's actions in reporting the incident to the police would then be justified, as they're reporting a crime. However, if the conflict was just a verbal disagreement without physical violence, then maybe the author escalated it by calling the police.\n\nBut according to the account, there was physical contact\u2014Karen pushed the author and tried to take the leash. The neighbor corroborated this. The police arrested her, which suggests they found probable cause. The author didn't instigate the physical confrontation; Karen did. The author's response was to seek police help, which is a standard action in such situations. \n\nThe author might feel some guilt because Karen was part of a protest, but the police revoked the DxE's permit because Karen was acting outside the protest's scope by engaging in physical altercations. The author isn't responsible for the other protesters; they just reported a crime. They might have felt conflicted about reporting someone for a felony, but if Karen's actions were criminal, then the author isn't at fault for standing up for themselves.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They reported a crime that was committed against them. The answer should be B.\n"
