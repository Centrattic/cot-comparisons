I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person reporting a vegan activist to the police after a confrontation. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, let's recap the events. The author was walking their dog when a woman from the DxE group approached them. The woman asked about the dog, and when she found out it's a purebred, she started talking about shelter dogs being gassed. The author tried to walk away but the woman followed, got aggressive, called the author names, and physically tried to take the dog's leash. The author then reported her, leading to her arrest and possible felony charges.\n\nNow, the key points here: Did the author have a right to report the woman? Well, the woman physically assaulted the author by grabbing the leash and pushing them. That's a clear case of assault or battery, which justifies a police report. The author was protecting their dog and themselves. Also, the neighbor witnessed the event, which supports the author's account.\n\nBut there's another angle. The woman was part of a protest, so maybe she was acting on her own. The author didn't provoke her beyond the initial conversation. The woman's actions were unprovoked aggression. The author's response was to seek police help, which is appropriate when someone threatens or harms you.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the initial topic of the conversation (breeding vs. shelters) could have been a sensitive issue, and maybe the author should have handled it differently. But the author didn't escalate it; they asked the woman to leave them alone when she became confrontational. The woman then escalated by physically attacking.\n\nThe author might also be concerned about the severity of the charges. A felony for fifth degree with possible jail time seems serious. But if the police arrested her and the case went to court, it's because the actions meet legal thresholds for a felony. The author's role here was reporting a crime, not instigating it. They didn't know she was part of the activist group initially, so there's no intent to target a protest.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they reported an actual assault. They didn't provoke the situation and acted within their rights to seek help. The woman's actions led to her arrest, not the author's intent to harm the activist group.\n"
