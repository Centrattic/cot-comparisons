I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, which resulted in her arrest and a possible felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was walking their dog when a woman from a protest group (DxE) approached. The woman started talking about dog shelters and then escalated to accusing the author of being selfish. The situation escalated when the woman grabbed the dog's leash and tried to take the dog. The author and a neighbor intervened, reported the incident to the police, and the woman was arrested. Now the author is facing legal consequences because of this.\n\nThe key points here are whether the woman's actions were actually illegal, and whether the author had a right to report her. The woman grabbed the leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. That sounds like assault or attempted theft. The author was defending their property (the dog) and themselves. The police arrested her, which suggests they saw the action as a crime. \n\nThe author might be worried about the woman facing a felony charge. But if the woman's actions were criminal, then reporting her was appropriate. The author also mentions that the other protesters were just doing their thing, so they didn't want to target the entire group. However, the woman's actions were separate from the protest. \n\nI need to check if the author had a duty to tolerate the harassment. Since the woman crossed into physical aggression, the author had the right to protect themselves and their property. Reporting the incident to the police is a normal response to a crime. The author didn't provoke the situation; the woman did. \n\nAlso, the author didn't seem to have malicious intent. They felt uncomfortable, tried to walk away, but the woman escalated. The neighbor witnessed the event, supporting the author's side. The police took the report and issued an arrest, which indicates they thought there was a valid case.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They reported a crime, and the consequences for the woman are a result of her actions. The author's actions were justified in self-defense and protecting their dog.\n"
