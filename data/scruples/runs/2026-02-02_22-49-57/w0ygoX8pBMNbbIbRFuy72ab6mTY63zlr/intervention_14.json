I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a person reporting a vegan activist to the police after an altercation. The key points are:\n\nFirst, the author was walking their dog and had a conversation with Karen, a DxE protester. Karen approached the author, commented on the dog, and then escalated the conversation by bringing up issues about shelter dogs. The author explained their reasoning for getting a breeder, but Karen pushed further, leading to a confrontation where she grabbed the dog's leash and tried to take it. The author then reported her to the police, leading to Karen's arrest and potential felony charges.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. To determine this, I need to consider the actions of both parties. Karen's actions seem to be the trigger here. She approached the author, had a conversation, then became aggressive by grabbing the leash and trying to take the dog. The author and their neighbor were involved in the situation, and the police were called. \n\nThe author's defense is that they were acting in self-defense and protecting their dog. The police arrest Karen, which suggests they found her actions warranted. However, the author feels conflicted because the protest was about free speech and they might feel bad that the entire protest's permit was revoked. \n\nBut legally, if Karen physically assaulted the author by grabbing the leash and trying to take the dog, that's a criminal act. The author had the right to report this. The problem is whether the author's initial interaction with Karen was appropriate. Did the author provoke Karen by engaging in conversation? The author explains they were just walking the dog when Karen approached them first. The author's response to Karen's questions seems reasonable; they were defending their choice to use a breeder. Karen's escalation into aggression is what led to the arrest.\n\nAnother point is that the author reported Karen immediately after the incident. The police's decision to revoke the protest permit might be due to Karen's actions being a violation of the protest rules, not the author's reporting. The author might have done the right thing in reporting a crime, even if they had mixed feelings about the protest.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue of proportionality. The charges against Karen are a felony, which is a serious charge. If the incident was a minor altercation, maybe the charges are excessive. But if Karen's actions were aggressive and threatening, then felony charges could be justified. The author mentions that Karen was arrested and the police took action, indicating that her actions were considered criminal.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions in reporting a crime seem justified. Karen's actions were the problem. The author didn't instigate the violence; they were defending themselves and their dog. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
