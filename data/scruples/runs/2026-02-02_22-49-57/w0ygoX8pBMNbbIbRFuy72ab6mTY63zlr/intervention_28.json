I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation where the activist, Karen, approached the dog owner during a protest. The owner says Karen grabbed the dog's leash, pushed them, and tried to take the dog. The owner then reported the incident, leading to Karen's arrest and potential felony charges.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If Karen physically assaulted the person by grabbing the leash and pushing them, that could be considered assault or battery, which are criminal offenses. In many jurisdictions, assault is any intentional act that causes another person to reasonably fear immediate bodily harm, while battery is the actual harmful or offensive contact. If Karen's actions meet these definitions, the owner was justified in reporting her.\n\nThe owner also mentions that a neighbor witnessed the event. That's important because it supports the credibility of the report. The police revoked the protest permit for DxE because Karen was part of the group, but the owner clarifies that they don't blame the other protesters and support free speech. This shows the owner tried to report only the specific individual involved in the misconduct.\n\nHowever, there's a potential gray area. The owner was walking their dog in a public place where a protest was happening. Karen's initial interaction was innocuous, asking about the dog, but escalated when she accused the owner of being selfish and then attempted to take the dog. The owner's response was to walk away, which is a reasonable reaction to an uncomfortable situation. When Karen continued to harass and then used physical force, the owner's decision to involve the police seems appropriate.\n\nAnother angle is the owner's motivation. They mention they bought the dog for $2500, which might influence their emotional state, but it's not illegal to be protective of one's property or pet. The key here is whether the force used by Karen was justified. Since Karen grabbed the leash and pushed the owner without provocation beyond a verbal argument, it's likely unlawful.\n\nPotential counterarguments could be that the owner provoked Karen by being a breeder, but the owner stated they used a reputable breeder, which is a legal method of acquiring a pet. The protest's focus on shelter animals doesn't negate the legality of using a breeder. The owner's right to defend their property and person is a valid legal defense.\n\nIn terms of the outcome, Karen facing a felony charge might be excessive if the incident was a minor assault, but the severity of the charges would depend on local laws. However, the owner's role in reporting a crime they witnessed (or were a victim of) is within their rights. They didn't instigate the situation but responded to an immediate threat.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, the owner acted within their rights by reporting the assault. They had a credible witness and faced an aggressive situation that warranted police intervention. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
