I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and potential felony charges. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the key events: The author is walking their dog when a woman from DxE (Direct Action Everywhere) approaches. The woman starts talking about purebreds and shelters, then accuses the author of being selfish for using a breeder. The conversation escalates, the woman grabs the dog's leash, pushes the author, and tries to take the dog. The author and a neighbor then report the incident to the police, leading to the woman's arrest.\n\nThe author is now facing a court date where the woman might get a felony charge, prison time, and a fine up to $2500. The author is torn about whether they did the right thing, especially since they mention supporting free speech but also being a victim of assault.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault here. Let's consider the legal aspects. If the woman physically assaulted the author by pushing them and trying to take the dog, that's a criminal act. In many jurisdictions, assault can be a felony, especially if it involves injury or threats. The author reporting a crime that occurred is generally their right. However, there might be nuances. Did the author provoke the situation? The woman started by talking about dog breeding, but the author didn't instigate the physical contact. The woman's actions were the direct cause of the arrest.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be questioned about their own role. Did they escalate the situation? The woman was confrontational, but the author was trying to walk away. The fact that the author had a neighbor as a witness supports their version of events. Also, the woman's actions (grabbing the leash, pushing) are clear physical aggression, which is a crime regardless of the reason behind it.\n\nThe author's motivation is also a factor. They report the incident because they were a victim of assault, not because of the ideological disagreement. The vegan activist's beliefs don't excuse criminal behavior. So legally, the author is within their rights to report a crime.\n\nEthically, some might argue that the author could have de-escalated differently, but given the physical assault, reporting it is the responsible action. The author also mentions feeling conflicted about the arrest affecting the protest, but that's about balancing free speech with personal safety. The police decision to revoke the permit might be separate from the author's actions.\n\nPotential issues: If the author's report was malicious or exaggerated, that would be wrong. But based on the story, the author acted in self-defense after an attack. The neighbor's testimony supports their account. So the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
