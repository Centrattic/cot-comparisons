I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person was walking their dog, and a vegan activist (Karen) approached them. They had a conversation where Karen accused the author of contributing to the problem of shelter dogs being euthanized by getting a purebred from a breeder. The author tried to explain their reasoning, but Karen got aggressive, called them names, grabbed the dog's leash, pushed them, and tried to take the dog. The author and a neighbor intervened, and they reported Karen to the police, leading to her arrest and potential felony charges.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If Karen physically assaulted the author by grabbing the leash, pushing them, and trying to take the dog, that could be considered assault or battery, depending on the jurisdiction. The author reporting her to the police and providing a statement would be their right if they were a victim of a crime. The police revoked the protest permit because Karen was part of a group, but that might be a separate issue. The author might not be at fault here because they were protecting themselves and their dog from an attack.\n\nSecond, the ethical angle. Karen was part of a protest, so she might have been there to voice her opinions. However, she crossed the line by engaging in physical confrontation. The author didn't provoke her beyond answering her questions about their dog. The author's actions were in self-defense and defense of their property (the dog). The author also considered free speech by not targeting the other protesters, which shows they didn't want to escalate the situation beyond what was necessary.\n\nThird, the potential charges against Karen. If she was charged with a felony, that might be a bit harsh depending on the severity of her actions. But if she physically attacked someone, even if it was during a protest, that's a criminal act. The author's role was to report the crime they experienced, which is within their rights.\n\nHowever, could there be a misunderstanding? The author might have overreacted if Karen's actions weren't actually threatening. But given the description\u2014grabbing the leash, pushing, trying to take the dog\u2014it seems like an actual assault occurred. The presence of a neighbor as a witness also supports the author's account.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting an assault. They were defending themselves and their dog. The charges against Karen, if based on the described actions, are justified. The author's hesitation and feeling torn might indicate they're considering the broader context of the protest, but legally and ethically, they acted appropriately to protect themselves from an attack.\n"
