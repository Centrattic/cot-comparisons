He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because customers are leaving. \n\nFirst, the author's situation: After their father's death, they're managing a car dealership. They hired a manager, Amy, who hired Anna, a trans sales rep. The author claims that customers leave when they see Anna, leading to profit drops. They suggested moving Anna to another role, but Amy called them transphobic.\n\nThe key points here are legal and ethical considerations. Legally, in the U.S., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on sex, which includes transgender individuals. So, firing or demoting someone solely because they are transgender is illegal. The EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) has stated that discrimination against trans people is a form of sex discrimination. Therefore, the author's suggestion to move Anna could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nEthically, the author is facing a conflict between their business interests and their employee's rights. While they argue that the business is losing money, the ethical stance would support protecting employees from discrimination. The author is not in a position to make decisions that affect others' employment based on their personal biases, even if those biases are about customer preferences.\n\nThe author claims to have no issue with trans people, but their action is based on the belief that the trans employee is causing business losses. However, this reasoning is flawed because it's the customers' prejudice that's the issue, not the employee's identity. The business should not discriminate against employees to accommodate customers' biases.\n\nAdditionally, the author's sister is mentioned, but that's not relevant here. The main issue is the treatment of Anna. The author might consider alternative solutions, like addressing customer complaints without discriminating against Anna. For example, providing training to employees to handle such situations or focusing on improving customer service to retain clients without compromising employee rights.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong both legally and ethically by suggesting that Anna should be moved due to her gender identity, which is protected under anti-discrimination laws.\n"
