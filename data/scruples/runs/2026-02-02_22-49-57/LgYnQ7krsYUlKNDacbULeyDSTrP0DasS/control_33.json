He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a car dealership that the author is now managing after their father's death. They hired a manager, Amy, and there's a trans sales rep named Anna. The author is considering moving Anna to another job because customers are leaving when they see her, which is affecting profits. The author claims they're not transphobic but are concerned about the business's success.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In the US, employment discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020). That means it's illegal to discriminate against an employee because of their gender identity. So, if the author wants to move Anna to a different position, especially one that's non-sales, that could be seen as discriminatory unless there's a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason.\n\nThe author argues that it's a business decision to retain customers. However, the EEOC and similar bodies emphasize that businesses can't make decisions based on stereotypes or prejudices, even if they claim it's for business interests. The author's concern that customers are leaving because Anna is trans is a business impact, but that doesn't necessarily make it a valid reason to discriminate. Also, the author hasn't tried other solutions, like educating customers or training Anna to address the issue without firing her.\n\nAnother angle is the author's intent. They say they have nothing against trans people and believe in respecting them. However, the action they're considering (moving Anna) could still be discriminatory regardless of intent. The law doesn't just look at intent but also at the impact of the decision.\n\nAdditionally, the author's sister is mentioned but isn't relevant to the main issue here. The key points are the legal protections for trans individuals, the business justification, and the potential for discrimination.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned to save the business, may still be in violation of anti-discrimination laws. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong from a legal and ethical standpoint.\n"
