He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep. The author says they have nothing against trans people, but customers in a conservative area are leaving when they see Anna, the trans sales rep, causing a drop in profits. They suggested moving Anna to another job, and Amy, the manager, called them transphobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In the US, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on sex, which includes gender identity. So firing or moving an employee because they are trans is illegal. The author is suggesting moving Anna to another position, which could be seen as discrimination. Even if the author's intention is to save the business, the action itself might be discriminatory.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author claims to respect trans people but is making a decision based on customers' prejudices. While their intention is to maintain business, it's a conflict between business needs and individual rights. The author might be conflating personal bias with business strategy, even if it's not their own bias. By attributing the loss of customers to Anna's gender identity, they might be enabling discrimination against her.\n\nAnother point is that the author is the new owner, and their father wanted them to run it. However, their solution is to discriminate, which could have legal repercussions. The author might be missing alternative solutions, like retraining staff, changing customer interactions, or addressing the root cause of customer discomfort without punishing Anna.\n\nSo even if the author's intention is to save the business, the action of moving Anna due to her gender identity is likely discriminatory. They are in the wrong because they are allowing customers' biases to affect an employee's position, which is against the law and ethical standards.\n"
