He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a trans woman, Anna, working as a sales rep in a car dealership in a conservative state. The author, who is taking over after his father's death, is told that customers are leaving when they see Anna, leading to a drop in profits. He suggested moving her to another job, but Amy (the manager) called him transphobic. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, including the US, employment discrimination based on gender identity is illegal. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to include gender identity. So, firing or demoting someone because they're trans could be discriminatory. The author's reasoning is business-related\u2014customers are leaving, so their presence affects profits. But legally, that's not a valid reason. Employers can't discriminate based on protected categories, even if it affects business.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. While the author claims he has no issue with trans people and is trying to save his dad's business, the action still leads to discrimination. It's a classic case of the \"business necessity\" defense, which might not hold up if there's a direct link to protected characteristics. The author might argue that customer comfort is a priority, but that's a form of catering to discriminatory behavior, which is against equal opportunity laws.\n\nAnother point is the role of Amy, the manager. She hired Anna for valid reasons (her skills), so the author's request to move her could undermine her authority. Also, Amy called him transphobic, which suggests she's aware of the potential for discrimination. The author might not realize that his action is discriminatory despite his intentions.\n\nHowever, the author's position is that he's trying to run the business without losing customers. But the law doesn't protect businesses from losing customers due to discrimination against protected groups. The business can't justify harmful behavior towards a protected class as a business decision. They might need to find other solutions, like training staff to handle customer complaints without discriminatory practices, or finding ways to retain customers without compromising their values.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the author's intent is to save the dealership, the action of moving Anna based on her gender identity is discriminatory and likely illegal. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
