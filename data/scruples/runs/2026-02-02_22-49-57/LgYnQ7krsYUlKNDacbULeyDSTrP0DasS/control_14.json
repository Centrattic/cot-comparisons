He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because customers are leaving. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's father passed away, and he's taking over the dealership. He's not running it full-time, instead hiring a manager. The manager hired Anna, a trans woman, as a sales rep. The author feels that customers are leaving because Anna is trans, leading to lower profits. He suggested moving her to another job, but the manager called him transphobic.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author claims he has no issue with trans people and respects them. But he's making a business decision based on customer behavior. However, there's a conflict between his business goals and the rights of Anna. Legally, in the US, it's prohibited to discriminate based on gender identity. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act covers that. So, even if customers are uncomfortable, the dealership can't legally discriminate against Anna for being trans.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author is prioritizing profit over the rights of his employee. Even if the customers are being bigoted, the business shouldn't accommodate that by discriminating against Anna. He's essentially asking to remove a qualified employee because some customers have prejudices, which is discriminatory.\n\nThe author might argue it's a business loss, but that's not a valid defense against discrimination laws. The business should find other solutions, like improving customer service or addressing the root of customer discomfort, rather than firing a trans employee. Plus, the author isn't the one who hired Anna; the manager did, and he's overriding that decision based on his own assumptions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's making a discriminatory decision under the guise of business necessity, which is not legally or ethically acceptable.\n"
