He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because some customers are leaving, leading to a drop in profits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Supreme Court in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), prohibits employment discrimination based on gender identity. So, firing or moving an employee because they are transgender is illegal. The author's suggestion to move Anna to another job could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The author claims to respect trans people but is making a business decision based on customer reactions. However, the customers are discriminating against Anna, not the other way around. The author is essentially prioritizing the comfort of transphobic customers over Anna's rights. That could be ethically questionable.\n\nThen there's the business perspective. The author is concerned about profits and customer loss. While it's true that some customers might leave because of Anna, the dealership could be losing potential customers who support inclusive businesses. There's a growing market that values diversity and inclusion, so this might be a missed opportunity.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that Amy hired Anna for valid reasons (confident, charming). The author is now suggesting moving her due to customer discrimination, which contradicts the initial hiring decision. That might be inconsistent in business strategy.\n\nThe author's responsibility as the new owner is to uphold non-discrimination policies, especially in a business setting. Even if the customers are conservative, the business should not accommodate their bigoted preferences at the expense of an employee's rights.\n\nAdditionally, the author's approach might not solve the problem. Customers might still leave upon seeing other trans employees or even cisgender employees who don't fit their expectations. It's not a sustainable solution and could lead to further legal issues.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong both legally and ethically. The decision to move Anna is discriminatory, even if framed as a business decision. The correct approach would be to address customer discrimination through education or other means that don't harm an employee's position.\n"
