He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because customers are leaving. \n\nFirst, the author says they have no issue with trans people and respect them. But they're in a conservative area where some customers are uncomfortable because the sales rep is trans. The author argues that this is causing a loss of customers and profits, so they suggested moving Anna to another role. Amy, the manager, called them transphobic.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. In the US, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on gender identity. So firing or demoting someone for being trans is illegal. The author isn't saying to fire her, but to move her to a different role. Would that still be discrimination? If the role change is based on her gender identity, even if well-intentioned, it might still be considered discriminatory.\n\nThe author's reasoning is about business losses due to customer preferences. However, businesses can't make decisions based on discriminatory practices towards employees. Even if customers are biased, it's the business's responsibility to address customer issues without discriminating against employees. Maybe there are other solutions, like training staff to handle customer objections or changing customer service approaches instead of moving the employee.\n\nThe author also mentions that profits have dropped. But they need to consider if the discrimination could lead to legal problems or damage the dealership's reputation. Plus, the transphobic reactions from customers are the customers' problem, not the employee's. The business should not accommodate bigoted customers at the expense of fair employment practices.\n\nSo, even though the author claims good intentions, the action is discriminatory. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
