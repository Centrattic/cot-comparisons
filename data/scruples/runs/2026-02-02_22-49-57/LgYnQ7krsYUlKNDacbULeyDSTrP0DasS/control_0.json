He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans woman as a sales rep because customers are leaving.\n\nFirst, the author's position is that they respect trans people but are making a business decision based on customer preferences and profit. They mention the dealership is in a conservative state where some customers are uncomfortable with a trans sales rep, leading to lost business. The author's sister isn't involved, and they wanted to honor their dad's wishes by managing it, even though they work in NYC.\n\nThe key points here are discrimination based on gender identity and business practices. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on gender identity, so firing or moving an employee because they're trans could be illegal. The author is suggesting moving Anna to a different role, which could be seen as discrimination if it's done because of her gender identity. Even if the customers are the ones leaving, the business can't justify discriminatory practices based on that. \n\nHowever, the author's intention is to save the business, not to harm Anna. But the law doesn't allow for such exceptions. The manager called the author transphobic, which might be accurate because the action is based on Anna's gender identity. The author might not be malicious, but the act itself is discriminatory. The business's solution should be to address customer bias, maybe through training or other means, rather than firing or demoting an employee. \n\nSo, even if the author's reasoning is about business loss, the action is unlawful and unethical. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
