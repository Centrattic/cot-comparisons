He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because customers are leaving. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author inherited a car dealership, hired a manager, and the manager hired a trans female sales rep named Anna. The problem is that in their conservative state, customers are leaving when they see Anna, leading to a drop in profits. The author suggested moving Anna to another role, but Amy (the manager) called them transphobic.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing business over keeping Anna as a sales rep. Legally, in the U.S., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on gender identity. So, firing or moving Anna because of her gender identity could be illegal. But the author isn't doing that; they're suggesting moving her due to customer reactions. However, if the reason is based on her gender identity, even if it's because of customer transphobia, it could still be considered discriminatory. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author is making a business decision based on potential losses. But they are allowing bias against trans people to affect their business decisions. Even if the customers are the ones with the bias, the author is perpetuating that by changing roles to accommodate the transphobic customers. This could be seen as discriminatory because they're prioritizing the comfort of a subset of customers over an employee's right to work in their chosen role.\n\nAdditionally, the author claims they have no issue with trans people, but their actions might still be harmful. It's not about their personal feelings but the systemic impact of their decision. By moving Anna, they're contributing to a hostile work environment for trans employees and possibly violating anti-discrimination laws.\n\nSo, even if the intention is to save the business, the action is discriminatory. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
