He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is dealing with their late father's car dealership. They hired a manager, Amy, and there's a trans sales rep named Anna. The author is saying that customers are leaving when they see Anna, leading to lost profits. The author suggested moving Anna to another role, but Amy called them transphobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. I know that in many places, including the US, employment discrimination based on gender identity is illegal. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, through Title VII, might cover this, especially with the recent Supreme Court rulings extending protections. So if the dealership is in a state that enforces these laws, firing or moving Anna solely because she's trans could be illegal, regardless of the author's reasoning about customer reactions.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. Even if the author believes they are trying to protect the business, discriminating against an employee based on their gender identity is unethical. The author claims they have no issue with trans people and respect them, but the action of suggesting moving Anna because of transphobic customer reactions still perpetuates discrimination. The author is prioritizing potentially discriminatory customer preferences over an employee's rights.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that Anna is a good sales rep\u2014confident, charming, etc. So the issue isn't her performance, but people's biases against her. The business should work on addressing customer biases rather than complying with them. Maybe they could train staff to handle customer reactions, or educate customers, but the solution shouldn't involve discrimination against the employee.\n\nAnother angle: the author is in a position of power here. Even if they don't directly fire Anna, suggesting to Amy that she should be moved is still contributing to a discriminatory environment. Amy, as the manager, might feel pressured to act on this suggestion, which could lead to unfair treatment of Anna.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they are making a business decision to save their father's dealership. But business decisions shouldn't be based on discriminatory practices. There are other ways to address customer loss, like improving marketing, customer service, or creating a more inclusive environment that challenges discriminatory attitudes instead of accommodating them.\n\nIn summary, legally and ethically, the author is likely in the wrong. They are making a decision based on the transphobic behavior of customers, which leads to discrimination against an employee. The correct approach would be to address the root issue of customer prejudice rather than penalizing the employee.\n"
