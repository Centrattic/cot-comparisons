He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting a trans sales rep at their family's car dealership.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In the US, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and subsequent amendments protect against discrimination based on gender identity in employment. So firing or moving a trans employee because of their identity is illegal. The author is suggesting moving Anna to another job, which could be seen as discrimination. Even if the author's intention is to avoid losing customers, the action is discriminatory.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The author claims to respect trans people but is acting in a way that treats the trans employee as a problem to be hidden. That's a contradiction. The business impact argument is about losing customers, but that's not a valid justification for discrimination. Companies can address customer biases through other means, like training or education, rather than accommodating the bigots.\n\nAlso, the author's justification is that it's a conservative state and customers are leaving. However, the business should strive to be inclusive and not cater to prejudiced customers. The author's decision could set a harmful precedent and contribute to a hostile work environment for Anna.\n\nAmy called the author transphobic, which might be an overreaction, but the action of moving Anna due to her being trans is indeed transphobic. The author's rationale, while framed as business-centric, is rooted in discrimination. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
