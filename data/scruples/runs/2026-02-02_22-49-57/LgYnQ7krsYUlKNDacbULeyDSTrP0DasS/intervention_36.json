He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because of customer reactions in a conservative area. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In the US, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on gender identity. So, firing someone just because they are trans is illegal. That's a key point here. The author is suggesting moving Anna to another role, which might be seen as a way to avoid direct discrimination but still indirectly penalize her for her identity.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author claims to respect trans people but is making a business decision based on customer biases. Even if the customers are the ones acting transphobically, the business is still discriminating against Anna by not allowing her to be a sales rep where she's hired for. The author is prioritizing profit over an employee's rights, which could be ethically questionable.\n\nThe author argues that profits have dropped, but that's a business decision influenced by customer prejudices. Discriminating against an employee to appease customers is not acceptable. The business could explore other solutions, like training staff to handle customer concerns or improving customer service elsewhere. \n\nAmy hired Anna for her skills, which are important for a sales role. If the issue is the customers' reactions, the problem lies with the customers, not Anna. The author's solution to move her might be a form of subtle discrimination. \n\nSo legally, the author is violating anti-discrimination laws. Ethically, they're making a decision based on prejudice. Even if the intention is to save the business, the action is discriminatory. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
