He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because customers are leaving. \n\nFirst, the author's main argument is that they don't have anything against trans people but are concerned about losing customers in a conservative state, leading to a drop in profits. They want to move Anna to another role to save the business.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in the U.S., the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other federal laws prohibit discrimination based on gender identity in employment. So firing or demoting Anna because of her gender identity could be illegal. The author is suggesting moving her to a non-customer-facing role, which might be a way to avoid direct discrimination, but still raises ethical issues.\n\nEthically, even if the author claims no personal bias, the decision is based on customers' prejudices, which could be seen as perpetuating discrimination. It's important to consider that businesses can't always cater to prejudiced customers without compromising values. However, the author is trying to balance business sustainability with their father's legacy.\n\nThe answer might depend on perspective. Legally, the author is likely in the wrong. Ethically, it's a gray area because they're trying to protect the business but at the expense of an employee's role based on customers' biases. The key point is that the author is using a discriminatory factor (trans identity) to make a business decision, which is problematic even if not done with malice.\n"
