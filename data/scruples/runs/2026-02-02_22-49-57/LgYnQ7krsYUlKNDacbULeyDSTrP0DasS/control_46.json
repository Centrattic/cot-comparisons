He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans sales rep because some customers are leaving.\n\nFirst, the context: The dealership is in a conservative state. The author, as the heir, is concerned about losing customers and profits because Anna, the trans sales rep, is visibly trans. The manager, Amy, hired her for her skills but the author wants her moved to another role.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited in many places. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in the US protects against such discrimination. So, moving Anna due to her gender identity could be illegal.\n\nEthically, the author is prioritizing business profits over inclusivity. While the author claims to respect trans people, the action taken (requesting Anna's reassignment) is based on discriminatory reasons. Even if the author's intention is to prevent losing customers, the business should not accommodate bigoted customers by discriminating against employees.\n\nMoreover, the author's argument about customers leaving is a form of \"reverse discrimination,\" which isn't a valid reason to discriminate against an employee. The responsibility of the business is to serve all customers without excluding any group, even if some choose to leave. The business isn't obligated to cater to discriminatory preferences.\n\nThe author's sister is mentioned as not being in business, but that's irrelevant here. The core issue is the author's decision to act against a trans employee's role, which is discriminatory regardless of the reasoning.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because their action is discriminatory and violates both legal and ethical standards, even if they have good intentions.\n"
