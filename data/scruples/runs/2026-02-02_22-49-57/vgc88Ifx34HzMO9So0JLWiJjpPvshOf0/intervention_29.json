Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to his fianc\u00e9e. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author knew his fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to ease her concerns about \"overloading the baby.\" They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, she's bringing up her opposition again, specifically against the Hep B vaccine at birth. He's a healthcare worker concerned about the risk of the baby contracting Hep B, even though it's unlikely. He's given her an ultimatum: the baby can wait a month before starting vaccinations, but he won't go beyond that. She's now upset, calling him manipulative and abusive. He's frustrated because she's not budging despite evidence from WHO and CDC. He's considering breaking up if she doesn't accept the compromise.\n\nSo the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me think about the factors here. They had discussed this before, and both agreed on vaccination. Now she's backtracking. He's given her a reasonable compromise, but she's not accepting it. He's also a healthcare worker, so his concerns about health risks are valid. On the other hand, she's not accepting the compromise and is escalating the conflict. But maybe he's being too rigid? Or is he justified in standing his ground on the health of their future children?\n\nIn relationships, compromise is important, but so is respecting each other's values. If they had a prior agreement, and she's now changing her stance without valid reasons, maybe the author is justified. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as manipulative, especially in a relationship. But in this case, he's setting boundaries based on his own principles and health concerns. The fianc\u00e9e isn't willing to meet him halfway, so he's trying to find the middle ground. The key here is whether the compromise he offered is reasonable. He allowed a one-month delay, which is a middle ground between her wanting no vaccines and his wanting standard schedule. If she can't accept that, maybe he's not in the wrong for not backing down further. He's also providing evidence and data to support his position, which shows he's trying to reason with her. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. He tried to find a compromise, presented evidence, and is standing by his values. The fianc\u00e9e isn't willing to budge, so he's setting a boundary. It's a tough situation, but he's not wrong for wanting his children to be vaccinated.\n"
