Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is unvaccinated and against vaccinating their future children, and the author is giving her an ultimatum. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they discussed alternative schedules before, and the fianc\u00e9e was okay with the kids being vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more against it. The author is a healthcare worker, so they have strong feelings about vaccines. They're saying they won't go beyond a one-month delay in starting the vaccine schedule because of the risks involved. The fianc\u00e9e is now accusing the author of being manipulative and abusive for giving an ultimatum.\n\nThe author is trying to balance respecting the fianc\u00e9e's beliefs while adhering to their own strong stance on vaccines. They've tried to compromise by allowing a delayed schedule but now the fianc\u00e9e is doubling down on her anti-vax views. The author is considering walking away, which is causing conflict.\n\nNow, the key question: Is the author in the wrong? \n\nWell, the author is standing by their principles because they're in a healthcare field, which likely reinforces their trust in medical science. They've tried to negotiate and compromise before, but the fianc\u00e9e's position has hardened. The ultimatum is about non-negotiable boundaries. Some might argue that giving an ultimatum is extreme, especially in a relationship. But others might see it as justified when it comes to health and safety of future children. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e was informed of the author's stance from the start and agreed to work towards vaccination. Now she's not buying into the compromise, which could be seen as a shift in her position. The author is trying to protect the child's health, which is a parent's responsibility. However, using an ultimatum could be seen as coercive, but given the context of child-rearing decisions, it's a serious matter.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They've made their stance clear, tried to find middle ground, and are now setting a firm boundary. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart might be the issue here. While the ultimatum is harsh, it's about a critical health decision for their children. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
