Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the fianc\u00e9e is unvaccinated and against vaccinating their future kids, while the author is a healthcare worker who supports vaccines. They had discussions before getting engaged about alternative schedules. The author proposes an ultimatum: either follow the vaccine schedule (starting with Hep B at birth) or the fianc\u00e9e would have to accept a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is now upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive, and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author made their stance clear from the start of the relationship. They even mentioned that when they first decided to be in a relationship, they told her their position on vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e agreed to work towards it, but now she's changed her mind. The author is a healthcare worker, so they have a professional background that informs their stance. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, is skeptical of vaccines, believing they're a hoax and that Big Pharma is involved. She's not swayed by data or evidence presented to her.\n\nThe key points here are consent in a relationship regarding major life decisions. When entering into a committed relationship, especially engagement, partners are expected to discuss and agree on significant issues like childcare. The author tried to compromise by suggesting an alternative schedule initially, but now they're firm on the one-month delay. The fianc\u00e9e is now upset, feeling coerced, but the author is standing their ground because the issue is non-negotiable for them.\n\nI need to assess whether the author is being unreasonable. Since the author is clear about their position from the start and the fianc\u00e9e later changed her position, maybe the author isn't at fault. However, giving an ultimatum about ending the relationship over this could be seen as extreme. But considering that the fianc\u00e9e is not open to discussion and the author has valid health and safety concerns (as a healthcare worker), it might be justified. The author isn't forcing her to vaccinate, but setting a boundary that they can't go beyond a one-month delay. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to meet in the middle and her change of stance after agreeing to work towards it might place the responsibility more on her. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of mutual respect and communication. The author communicated their stance early on, and the fianc\u00e9e might not have fully considered the implications of her position. However, relationships require flexibility. If the author is unwilling to adjust further, but the fianc\u00e9e is unwilling to meet the author's minimum requirement, it's a conflict of values. In such cases, it's not necessarily the author's fault if the fianc\u00e9e can't accept the compromise. The author is protecting their values and the child's health, which is a valid concern. \n\nI should also consider cultural and personal beliefs. The fianc\u00e9e's distrust of vaccines is a strong stance, but the author has professional expertise and access to data. The author isn't pushing for the standard schedule in full but is allowing some flexibility. Given that, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary they can't cross. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be more about the ultimatum style rather than the content, but the author has a right to make decisions regarding their child's health based on their values and profession. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because they communicated their position early, tried to find a middle ground, and now are firm on their non-negotiable due to health concerns. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart and refusal to accept the compromise could be her fault, but the question is about the author's fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
