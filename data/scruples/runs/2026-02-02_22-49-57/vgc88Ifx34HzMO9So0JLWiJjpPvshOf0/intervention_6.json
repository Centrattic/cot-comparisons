Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is unvaccinated and against vaccinating their future children. The author, who is a healthcare worker, has a firm stance on vaccines and set an ultimatum: the baby can't go more than a month without starting the vaccine schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is now upset, calling the ultimatum manipulative and abusive, leading to the question of whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author knew the fianc\u00e9e's stance before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more against it, and the author set a limit. The fianc\u00e9e is reacting strongly, leading to conflict.\n\nI should consider both sides. The author prioritizes their values and health concerns, especially as a healthcare worker. They're trying to protect the child from preventable diseases, using data from WHO and CDC. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, has conspiracy theories (like Big Pharma) and doesn't believe vaccines work, despite evidence. The author tried to find a middle ground by allowing a deferred schedule but has a limit.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Ultimatums in relationships can be sensitive. However, if both parties have discussed this before and the author presented their non-negotiable line, it's about personal values. The author isn't forcing the fianc\u00e9e to vaccinate herself but the child. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance post-engagement is a key point. The author's stance is about their own children's health, which is a personal choice.\n\nBut wait, is it fair to walk away over this? Some might argue that a relationship requires compromise. However, if core values are at stake, like the health of their children, it's a significant factor. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence might indicate that her position isn't flexible, making compromise impossible. The author isn't forcing the issue but setting a boundary. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be about feeling pressured, but the author's position is based on prior agreement and professional experience.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person setting boundaries is seen as less at fault if they've discussed it beforehand. The author tried to find a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9e's accusations of manipulation and abuse might be an emotional response rather than a factual one. The author's actions are within their right to prioritize their values, even if it leads to the end of the relationship. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
