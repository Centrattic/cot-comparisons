Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9e and vaccines. The author knew she was unvaccinated before proposing and they had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated in some way. Now, after being engaged a month, she brings up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author sets an ultimatum: either they follow a modified schedule with a one-month delay, or the author can't continue the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is a healthcare worker, which might make them more concerned about vaccine safety and efficacy. The fianc\u00e9e's stance has changed from being willing to work towards vaccination to being strongly against it. The author has tried presenting data from WHO and CDC, but the fianc\u00e9e still refuses, citing conspiracy theories and misinformation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum. On one hand, having strong beliefs about your children's health is understandable. The author made their stance clear from the start of the relationship and tried to find a compromise. They might feel that their boundaries are valid, especially considering their profession. On the other hand, ultimatums in relationships can be seen as controlling or manipulative, especially if one partner's non-negotiables affect the other's choices.\n\nBut in this case, the author had prior agreement that the children would be vaccinated. The fianc\u00e9e's recent change of heart might have broken that mutual understanding. The author's compromise was to delay the first vaccines by a month. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal could be seen as not respecting the earlier agreement they had. Also, the author is trying to balance their professional knowledge with the fianc\u00e9e's beliefs, which are based on misinformation.\n\nHowever, giving an ultimatum can strain a relationship. Even if the author's stance is based on health reasons, the way they're enforcing it might be seen as extreme. But considering the fianc\u00e9e's shift in position and the potential health risks, the author might feel it's necessary. The key is whether the author is being reasonable in their expectations and if the ultimatum is a fair response to a broken agreement.\n\nIn terms of ethics, both partners have a right to their beliefs, but when it comes to children's health, parental decisions can have real consequences. The author is trying to protect the child's health based on their own expertise. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal is based on unfounded claims, which complicates things. The author's compromise might be the best middle ground they could find.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They set boundaries based on prior agreements and their professional judgment. The fianc\u00e9e's resistance is based on misinformation and a change of heart, which the author is addressing through an ultimatum. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
