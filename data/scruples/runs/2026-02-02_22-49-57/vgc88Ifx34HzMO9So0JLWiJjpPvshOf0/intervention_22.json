Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is opposed to vaccines, and the author sets an ultimatum about vaccinating their future children. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling him manipulative and abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author knew she was unvaccinated before proposing and they discussed alternative schedules. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month, she's more against it, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and sets a limit: the baby can't go past one month without starting a schedule. He's firm because he can't compromise on safety, citing data and public health info. She's now upset, saying he's being abusive. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion. So, I need to weigh both sides. From a logical standpoint, the author is standing by a decision he discussed upfront. He's made his stance clear before the engagement, and now is setting a boundary. However, ultimatums can be seen as controlling, even if the subject is important. But considering the health of the child, vaccines are a public health issue, and the author is a healthcare professional. The fianc\u00e9e's initial agreement and subsequent change of heart might complicate things.\n\nLegally, in the US, both parents have a right to make medical decisions for their children, but if one parent is against vaccines, it's a conflict. However, most states require vaccines for school, and courts often side with vaccination in cases of parental conflict. So the author might have a stronger legal position here.\n\nEmotionally, setting an ultimatum could strain the relationship. But the author says he doesn't want things to end and is trying to find a middle ground with a deferred schedule. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence might be the root of the problem. The author isn't forcing his views on her but is setting a boundary for their child's health.\n\nIn terms of manipulation or abuse, it's a gray area. Ultimatums can be seen as a form of pressure, but if it's about protecting a child's health, some might see it as justified. The fianc\u00e9e's initial agreement and current stance could be inconsistent. The author is trying to uphold an agreement they made.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing by his principles and the child's health, which is a significant responsibility. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to compromise despite prior agreement might leave the author in the right. So the answer should be B.\n"
