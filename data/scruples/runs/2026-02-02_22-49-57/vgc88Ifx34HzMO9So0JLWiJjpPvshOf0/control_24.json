Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9e who is against vaccinating their future children, and the author gives an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules from another country, agreeing that kids would get vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially Hep B at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and sets an ultimatum: either start with the Hep B vaccine at birth or a delayed schedule for the first month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive. The author is now seeking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author overstepped by giving an ultimatum on vaccines. Let's break it down. The author made a compromise initially by considering an alternative schedule from another country. They tried to find middle ground. But then the fianc\u00e9e's stance hardened. The author, in their role as a healthcare worker, is prioritizing child health based on their profession. The ultimatum is setting a boundary: either follow the Hep B vaccine at birth or delay for a month. The author isn't entirely against vaccines, just wants a modified schedule. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is against vaccines entirely, calling them a hoax and not trusting big pharma. She's not budging despite evidence.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The author is standing their ground on a non-negotiable issue for them. They communicated their stance early in the relationship, and the fianc\u00e9e initially agreed. Now she's changed her position. The ultimatum is a way to enforce their boundaries. But is it manipulative or abusive as she claims? It depends on context. Ultimatums can be seen as controlling, but if it's about a core value (child's health), some might see it as justified. The author is trying to find a compromise but can't go beyond their limit. However, the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any vaccines at all is a deal-breaker for the author. The author isn't forcing them to follow the full schedule but is allowing for a delay. So, the author is not entirely in the wrong if they're protecting their values and health concerns. On the other hand, the ultimatum could be seen as too rigid, but given the fianc\u00e9e's extreme stance, the author might have no choice. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
