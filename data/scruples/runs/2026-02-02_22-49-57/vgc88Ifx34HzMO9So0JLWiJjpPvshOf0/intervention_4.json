Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a healthcare worker who's engaged to someone who's unvaccinated. They had discussed alternative schedules for their future kids, maybe from another country, to ease her concerns about \"overloading the baby.\" They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is against vaccines entirely, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author gives her an ultimatum: either vaccinate the kids or the relationship ends. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. The author is a healthcare worker, so they have a strong stance on vaccines, and they've presented data to counter her claims, but she's not budging. The author is considering walking away if she doesn't agree.\n\nFirst, the author brought up the topic of vaccines before proposing, which is good. They discussed and found a middle ground initially. The fianc\u00e9e's current stance is more against vaccines now, which the author finds concerning. The author's ultimatum is a one-month delay before following an alternative schedule, but the fianc\u00e9e refuses. The author is a healthcare worker, so they have a professional perspective. The fianc\u00e9e's arguments are based on conspiracy theories (Big Pharma, vaccines don't work) and misinformation. The author tried to present data (like WHO, CDC, Japan's whooping cough situation) but she's not convinced.\n\nNow, the key points here: Did the author act in the wrong by giving an ultimatum? In relationships, especially when there are fundamental disagreements about child-rearing, it's a major decision. The author is standing by their convictions, which is understandable given their profession. However, ultimatums can be seen as extreme. The fianc\u00e9e felt pressured and accused the author of being manipulative. But the fianc\u00e9e also changed her stance after agreeing to work towards vaccination. The author had tried to compromise before but now is setting a firm line, which might be necessary given the risks involved in not vaccinating children.\n\nOn one hand, the author is protecting future children's health. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's autonomy in her beliefs is being challenged. However, when it comes to medical decisions for children, both parents have a role. If one parent is completely against vaccination, and the other sees it as essential for the child's health, it's a significant conflict. The author's stance is that they can't compromise further, which is their right, but the method of using an ultimatum might be seen as harsh. Yet, considering the importance of vaccinations for public health and the child's well-being, the author's position is defensible. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any vaccination despite evidence could be seen as putting the child at unnecessary risk. So, the author might not be in the wrong here because they're prioritizing the child's health, even if the approach led to a breakup. Alternatively, some might argue that the ultimatum is too drastic, but given the stakes (child's health), it's a justified stance. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
