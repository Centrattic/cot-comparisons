Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong regarding an ultimatum over vaccines with their fianc\u00e9e. The answer options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before they got engaged. They discussed alternative vaccine schedules, and he proposed following some other country's schedule. He's a healthcare worker concerned about the risks of not vaccinating. She's now against Hep B at birth, even though there's no medical reason she could be a carrier. He gives her an ultimatum: either start the vaccine schedule within a month or he'll leave. She's accusing him of being manipulative and abusive.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. My job is to evaluate both sides. \n\nFrom his perspective, he's standing by his commitment to vaccinate their future children, which he's been clear about from the start. He's willing to compromise on the schedule but has a limit. As a healthcare worker, he's aware of the risks of not vaccinating. Her stance is shifting, and she's not budging despite evidence. \n\nFrom her side, she's being accused of being anti-vax and not considering his position. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as extreme, especially in a relationship. But if he made his position clear from the beginning and she agreed, he might be justified in setting a boundary.\n\nFactors to consider: Did he give her enough time to adjust her stance? Did he present evidence and still face resistance? Is an ultimatum a reasonable step when both sides are unmoving? \n\nIn relationships, ultimatums can be seen as harsh, but when it's about a non-negotiable issue that affects health and safety, some might find it justified. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to consider evidence and her initial agreement now being disregarded may weaken her position. \n\nHe's trying to protect future children, which is a parent's duty. Her changing stance might indicate a lack of commitment to their prior agreement. \n\nHowever, the method of handling it\u2014giving an ultimatum after a month\u2014could be problematic. Maybe he should have given her more time or tried more mediation. But given the circumstances, his stance might be reasonable. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's protecting his values and the child's health, especially when she's not compromising. The answer would be B.\n"
