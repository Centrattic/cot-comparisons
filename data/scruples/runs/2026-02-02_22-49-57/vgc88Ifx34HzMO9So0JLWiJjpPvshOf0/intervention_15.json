Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who is a healthcare worker and wants their kids to be vaccinated. They knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing, and they discussed alternative schedules. They agreed that the kids would follow some sort of vaccination schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is bringing up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author sets an ultimatum: the baby can't start any alternative schedule for the first month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive. She had previously agreed to work towards vaccination, but now she's not. The author is a healthcare worker and cites data from WHO and CDC, but she still refuses, thinking vaccines are a hoax and don't work. The author is considering walking away if she doesn't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is wrong. The key points are mutual agreement before marriage, the author's stance as a healthcare worker, the fianc\u00e9e's sudden change in position, and the ultimatum given. The author mentions they discussed alternative schedules and came to an agreement. The fianc\u00e9e is now opposing it, even with evidence presented. The author's limit is a one-month delay, which seems reasonable given their health job. But is an ultimatum in a relationship wrong? \n\nOn one hand, making a decision about medical care for children is a significant issue. Both parents should ideally agree, but if there's a fundamental disagreement, it's hard to proceed. The author isn't forcing vaccines but setting a boundary. On the other hand, ultimatums can be seen as controlling. However, in this case, it's about a core value (child's health) and the fianc\u00e9e is not budging despite prior agreement. The fianc\u00e9e is changing her stance without valid medical reasons, relying on anti-vaxxer beliefs. The author's position seems justified because they've tried to meet halfway with an alternative schedule but now the fianc\u00e9e is in complete denial of medical evidence. \n\nBut maybe there's another angle. Should the author have been more flexible? However, the fianc\u00e9e is not only unvaccinated but also holds strong anti-vaccine views, which could pose risks. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about disease transmission. The ultimatum is a way to set a boundary. It's possible that the author is right in maintaining their stance because the health of the children is paramount. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be overblown, but the author isn't the one causing the issue here. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They tried to compromise, presented evidence, and set a reasonable limit. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal is based on misinformation and a change of heart. The author is standing by their commitment to their children's health, which is a valid reason for the ultimatum. So answer B.\n"
