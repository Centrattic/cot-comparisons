Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (they refer to themselves as \"I\") is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e is unvaccinated and initially agreed to an alternative schedule. They had a discussion and came to an agreement that their kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, she's brought it up again, strongly opposing the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and wants to follow a schedule. They set a limit of a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive for giving ultimatums. The author is confused because the fianc\u00e9e initially agreed but now is refusing. \n\nThe author presented their stance, showing they tried to compromise by allowing some delay. They provided data and evidence but she's not budging. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author isn't forcing vaccines but setting a boundary. They allowed a compromise initially but now the fianc\u00e9e is backtracking on her agreement. The author's reasoning is based on health and safety, using their own experience as a healthcare worker. They also mention that the fianc\u00e9e was against vaccines from the start, bringing up conspiracy theories about big pharma. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e is upset about the ultimatum. The author is giving her a choice: accept the compromise or leave. Ultimatums in relationships can be stressful, but if both parties had previously agreed to some vaccination plan, then the author is following through. The fianc\u00e9e changed her mind after accepting the initial agreement. \n\nThe key points here are prior agreement and the author's right to set a boundary. The author isn't being rigid but has set a reasonable limit. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance without discussing it first could be seen as the problem. Also, the author is trying to balance their concerns with the fianc\u00e9e's, giving her some leeway. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence and their prior agreement might be where the issue lies. The author isn't wrong for holding to their boundary, especially after the fianc\u00e9e agreed initially. So, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
