Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. I need to figure out if the answer is A or B based on the situation provided.\n\nFirst, let me understand the scenario. The author proposed to their fianc\u00e9e knowing she was unvaccinated. They had discussed alternative schedules, like maybe following another country's plan, to ease her concerns about overloading the baby. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of being engaged, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk of the baby getting Hep B from someone else, given the fianc\u00e9e's lack of medical history. The author sets an ultimatum: either follow an alternative schedule starting a month after birth or the relationship might end. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive, and is denying the effectiveness of vaccines despite evidence provided.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent in a relationship, compromise, and the right to make healthcare decisions. The author is standing firm on their belief in vaccines, which is backed by scientific consensus. The fianc\u00e9e, however, has changed her stance, now being more anti-vax despite prior agreement. The author is trying to find a middle ground by allowing a delayed schedule but not refusing vaccines entirely. The ultimatum comes down to whether the author is justified in setting this boundary.\n\nIn terms of ethics, when it comes to children's healthcare, parents typically have shared decision-making rights. However, if one parent is completely against vaccines, there can be legal and ethical issues. The author is trying to balance the fianc\u00e9e's concerns with evidence-based practices. The ultimatum is a personal boundary, and while it's a significant decision, it's about protecting the child's health. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of how the ultimatum is presented. The author mentions they discussed this before the engagement, so the fianc\u00e9e was aware. However, by the time of the ultimatum, she's changed her position, leading to conflict. The author is trying to maintain the relationship but has a non-negotiable line. Whether that's right depends on whether the ultimatum is seen as reasonable. Since the author is offering a modified schedule (a month delay) instead of full vaccination, it's a compromise, not a complete refusal. Given the scientific consensus on vaccines, the author's stance seems justified. The fianc\u00e9e's denial of vaccine efficacy despite evidence complicates things, but the author isn't forcing vaccines immediately, just setting a limit. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the author is not at fault for setting a boundary, especially when it's for the child's health. The fianc\u00e9e's opposition isn't based on evidence, and the author has tried to meet her halfway. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
