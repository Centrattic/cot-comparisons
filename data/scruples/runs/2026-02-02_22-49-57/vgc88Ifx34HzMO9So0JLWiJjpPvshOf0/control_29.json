Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the Reddit post) is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author mentions they knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussions about alternative schedules, possibly from another country, to ease her concerns about overloading the baby. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated under some schedule. Now, after being engaged a month, the fianc\u00e9e is against vaccines more strongly, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk of the baby getting infected from others. The author set a limit: the baby can't go a month without starting some schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, accusing the author of being manipulative and abusive. The author wants to stay but can't budge on vaccines. They showed her data from WHO and CDC, but she still refuses to accept vaccines, calling them a hoax. The author gave her an ultimatum, leading to the current conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nKey points to consider: The author had prior discussions and the fianc\u00e9e agreed to work towards vaccination. The author proposed an alternative schedule as a compromise. The fianc\u00e9e is now backtracking and being more resistant, with anti-vaccine beliefs despite evidence. The author has a valid concern about public health and the baby's safety. They're a healthcare worker, so they understand the risks. The ultimatum is given because the author can't compromise further. The fianc\u00e9e is accusing the author of abuse, but is that justified?\n\nPossible arguments against the author: Ultimatums can be seen as controlling. Maybe the author didn't consider other solutions or didn't allow enough time for discussion. Vaccines are a personal choice, and the author is imposing their view. However, the fianc\u00e9e had previously agreed and is now changing her stance. The author is trying to protect the child, which is a parent's responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, arguments for the author: They made a compromise (alternative schedule). The fianc\u00e9e is being anti-vaccination without evidence. The author's stance is based on public health data. The ultimatum is to protect the child's health, which is a valid reason. The fianc\u00e9e's accusations of abuse might be an overreaction.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. If the author had a prior agreement and the fianc\u00e9e is reneging, then the author is not in the wrong for setting boundaries. The author is not forcing vaccines but offering a modified schedule. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal despite evidence might mean the author is justified in their stance. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
