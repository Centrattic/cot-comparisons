Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before they got engaged. They discussed alternative schedules, and the author was okay with that as long as the kids got vaccinated eventually. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is against vaccines, especially Hep B at birth, and the author is giving her an ultimatum: either accept a deferred schedule with a one-month delay or it's over. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive. The author is a healthcare worker and cites data, but she doesn't budge.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author made their stance clear from the start, proposed a compromise (alternative schedule with a delay), and now the fianc\u00e9e is rejecting that. The author is willing to walk away if she can't agree. The question is whether this ultimatum makes the author at fault.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the author is standing by their values and health beliefs, which they communicated early on. They tried to find a middle ground. On the other hand, giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be seen as extreme, especially if it's a non-negotiable issue. But vaccines are a significant health matter, and the author is concerned about their child's safety. \n\nI also need to think about consent and autonomy. The fianc\u00e9e might feel her views are being dismissed. But the author is also asserting their right to have their children vaccinated. There's a balance between respecting each other's beliefs and making decisions for the child's welfare. \n\nThe author is a healthcare worker, which might inform their trust in vaccines, while the fianc\u00e9e's skepticism is based on misinformation. However, relationships require compromise. The author tried to meet her halfway, but she's not budging. The ultimatum is a last resort to protect their values. \n\nIs it wrong to set a firm boundary? Maybe not, especially if the author made their position clear from the start. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after agreeing earlier. The author isn't forcing her to get vaccinated; they just want the child to be. The ultimatum is about the child's care, not the fianc\u00e9e's own vaccination. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. They communicated their stance, tried to find a compromise, and are standing firm when the other person isn't willing to meet them halfway. Relationships require mutual respect and agreement on major issues. If both can't agree on a child's medical care, it's a valid reason for the relationship to end.\n"
