Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who's unvaccinated and their engagement. The author knew about this before proposing and they had discussed alternative vaccine schedules for future kids. But now, after getting engaged, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines and even the Hep B vaccine at birth, which the author wants to stick to a modified schedule. The author, a healthcare worker, is firm on vaccinating the kids, giving an ultimatum: either follow a modified schedule starting at one month or the author would walk away. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive.\n\nHmm, the author is standing by their conviction about vaccines, which are a personal belief. They made their stance clear from the start of the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e agreed initially but now is backtracking. The author is trying to find a middle ground by allowing a delayed schedule but has a limit. The fianc\u00e9e's opposition is based on misinformation, like thinking it's a big pharma scam and vaccines don't work. The author is providing data to counter that, but it's not working.\n\nIs the author wrong for setting a firm boundary? Well, in a relationship, both partners should respect each other's non-negotiables. The author made their position clear early on. The fianc\u00e9e changed her mind after the engagement, which might have been a red flag. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as extreme, but if this is a core value for the author, maybe they're not wrong. The fianc\u00e9e might be in the wrong for not sticking to her initial agreement or not being honest about her stance. \n\nBut considering the emotional aspect, relationships require compromise. The author is trying to find a middle ground but the fianc\u00e9e isn't budging. The author's healthcare background adds credibility to their stance. The fianc\u00e9e's arguments are based on conspiracy theories and misinformation. So maybe the author is not in the wrong here. The key points are mutual respect and the initial agreement. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart after engagement is problematic. So the answer is B.\n"
