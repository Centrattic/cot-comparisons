Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after giving a vaccine ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nSo the background: The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated when they got engaged. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country. The author is a healthcare worker and is pro-vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e is now more against vaccines, especially the Hep B at birth. The author offered a compromise of waiting a month before starting any schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive. The author is considering ending the relationship over this.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the ethics here. The author is setting a boundary based on their strong belief in vaccines. They tried to find a middle ground (alternative schedule, some delay). The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance, becoming more anti-vax despite being presented with evidence. The author is a healthcare worker, so they probably have a professional reason to support vaccines. \n\nIs it wrong to set such a boundary? Well, when it comes to medical decisions, especially for children, parents often have to agree. If one parent is anti-vax and the other is pro, this can lead to conflict. The author is trying to protect the child's health, which is a valid concern. However, giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be a big deal. But in this case, it's about the child's well-being, which parents are responsible for. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e changed her position after the engagement. The author had previously discussed this, and she agreed to work towards vaccination. Now she's not. That's a change in stance, which the author might not be willing to accept. The author tried to meet her halfway but she's not budging. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is trying to protect the child's health. The fianc\u00e9e is being anti-vax despite evidence. The author's compromise (waiting a month) is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because she feels pressured, but the author is standing by his non-negotiable line. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. They're making a decision based on their beliefs and trying to protect the child. The fianc\u00e9e's resistance is problematic, especially after agreeing before. The author isn't forcing her to vaccinate, but is setting a boundary for the child's treatment. So the answer would be B.\n"
