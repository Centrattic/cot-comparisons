Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum over vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, the background: The author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules, possibly from another country, to make her feel more comfortable. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated under some schedule. Now, a month into engagement, she's more opposed, especially to Hep B at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risk and sets an ultimatum: the baby can get a delayed but still a schedule starting within a month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive, and the author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author had prior discussions and an agreement. They set boundaries based on their own health care knowledge and risk assessment. The fianc\u00e9e's stance has become more extreme, dismissing evidence and data. The author is trying to find a middle ground with a modified schedule, but the fianc\u00e9e isn't budging. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The author is standing by their initial agreement and their own values. They're not forcing vaccination but are offering an alternative schedule as a compromise. However, the fianc\u00e9e is not willing to accept any vaccination, according to the TLDR, but the author says they offered a modified schedule. Wait, the TLDR says the author offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum. So, maybe the fianc\u00e9e isn't completely against all vaccines but wants a different approach. \n\nBut the author is giving an ultimatum, which is a significant step. Ultimatums can be problematic in relationships because they leave no room for discussion. However, the author mentions they've tried to reason with data from CDC and WHO, and she's not budging. So, the author is trying to protect their children's health, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they're trying to uphold their values and protect their child. On the other, giving an ultimatum might be seen as inflexible. However, the author had prior discussions and set expectations early in the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to work towards it but is now backtracking. \n\nIn terms of ethical or moral wrong, it's about respecting each other's boundaries. If the author made it clear from the start, and the fianc\u00e9e knew, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The ultimatum is a consequence of the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to compromise. However, the author could be seen as not respecting the fianc\u00e9e's autonomy if the ultimatum is too rigid. But since they offered a modified schedule, it's a compromise. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They tried to find a middle ground and set a boundary to protect their child's health. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any vaccination, despite the compromise, might be the root of the issue. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong)."
