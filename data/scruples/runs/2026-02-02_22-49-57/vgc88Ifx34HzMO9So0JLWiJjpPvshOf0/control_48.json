Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9e who's unvaccinated and the author is giving an ultimatum about vaccinating their future children.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions they discussed alternative schedules before proposing, but now the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed. The author is a healthcare worker, which probably influences their stance. They set a limit of a one-month delay before starting vaccines, and the fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative or abusive.\n\nThe key points here are consent and ultimatums. The author says they discussed this before the engagement, but now the fianc\u00e9e is changing her stance. The author is standing their ground, not willing to compromise further. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's arguments are based on distrust in the system (big pharma, vaccines don't work), despite data provided. The author is concerned about risks of not vaccinating, citing disease probabilities. \n\nIs the author wrong for setting boundaries? If they had a prior agreement and she's now backtracking, maybe the author is justified. But giving an ultimatum could be seen as extreme. However, considering the author's profession and the health risks involved, they might have a valid reason. \n\nOn the other hand, forcing someone into a specific medical decision for their children can be seen as coercive. The fianc\u00e9e might feel her autonomy is being violated. But since they're planning to have children together, both have a say. The author's stance is about protecting the child's health, which is a parent's duty. \n\nThe question is whether the ultimatum crosses a line. If they had agreed on vaccines before, and she's now reneging, the author isn't wrong for holding up their end. But if the fianc\u00e9e never truly agreed and the author pressures her, that's different. However, the author mentioned she initially agreed to work towards vaccination, so maybe she's not in good faith now.\n\nIn terms of ethics, parents do have the right to make medical decisions for their children. If the author is a healthcare worker, their knowledge might make them more concerned. So, the author isn't in the wrong for standing by their principles, especially if they communicated their stance early on. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart after agreement could make the author justified in their ultimatum.\n"
