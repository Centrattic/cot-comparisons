Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who set an ultimatum about vaccinating their children. The fianc\u00e9e was already known to be unvaccinated before the proposal, and they had previously agreed that the kids would be vaccinated, maybe on an alternative schedule. Now, after a month, she's bringing it up again, being against Hep B vaccine at birth because she can't see how the baby would contract it. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk and sets a limit: the baby can't be unvaccinated for more than a month before starting some alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive, and claims she was willing to work towards vaccination before. The author is now considering walking away if she doesn't agree.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the ultimatum and the prior agreement. The author gave a clear deadline, which is an ultimatum. The fianc\u00e9e is now resistant, even though they had discussed it before. The author's reasoning is based on their healthcare background and concern for the baby's health. However, the fianc\u00e9e's stance seems to have hardened, and she's accusing the author of being manipulative.\n\nIn relationships, especially when it comes to such important decisions, communication and mutual respect are crucial. The author might be justified in their stance because they had a prior agreement, but using an ultimatum could be seen as harsh. It's possible that the author didn't consider the fianc\u00e9e's feelings or the possibility of compromise beyond the initial discussion. The fianc\u00e9e might feel that her autonomy is being disregarded, even if they had agreed before. Her changing position could be a sign of deeper issues, like fear or changing beliefs, which the author didn't address properly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is standing by their non-negotiable line for the baby's health. They provided a window (one month) which might be more flexible than the fianc\u00e9e expected. The author also tried to provide evidence from WHO and CDC but the fianc\u00e9e is still not budging. Maybe the author is in a right to protect the child, but the way they presented the ultimatum could be problematic. Ultimatums often create a win-lose scenario, which can strain relationships. The fianc\u00e9e might have felt pressured, leading her to react strongly.\n\nAlso, the author was clear from the start about their stance on vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to work towards it. Now, the author is firm because they can't have the baby unvaccinated beyond a certain point. The question is whether setting a strict limit without further negotiation is wrong. It's a balance between respecting the fianc\u00e9e's beliefs and the author's non-negotiable health concerns for the child.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the author is prioritizing the child's health, but the approach might have been too rigid. The fianc\u00e9e's resistance might be due to valid personal beliefs or misinformation. The author's use of an ultimatum could be seen as controlling, especially if it's the first major conflict after a month of engagement. The answer depends on whether the author's ultimatum is considered reasonable given the prior agreement and the importance of the issue. If the prior agreement was to follow some schedule, and the author is now setting a firm timeline, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they had discussed it before. However, the way the ultimatum was given and the lack of willingness to revisit the discussion might be where the issue lies. \n\nBut the fianc\u00e9e is now accused of being manipulative and abusive. The author is standing their ground, but if the ultimatum is the only compromise they're willing to accept, perhaps they are justified. However, some might argue that the author should have been more flexible or found another way to handle the disagreement without an ultimatum. So, the answer could be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they had a prior agreement and the issue is critical for the child's health. But others might say that the ultimatum is too harsh, making the author in the wrong. It's a tough call, but considering the prior discussion and the author's profession, B seems plausible.\n"
