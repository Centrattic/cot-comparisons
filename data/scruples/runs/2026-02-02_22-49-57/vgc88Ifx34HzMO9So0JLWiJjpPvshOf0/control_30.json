Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who set an ultimatum regarding vaccinating their future children. The fianc\u00e9e is against vaccines, and the author has given her an ultimatum to either agree to a slightly delayed schedule or face the end of the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions they discussed alternative schedules before proposing, and the fianc\u00e9e agreed to vaccinate the kids. Now, she's becoming more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risks of not vaccinating and has set a firm boundary. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nI should think about the ethics here. The author is standing their ground on a health issue that's important to them. Vaccines are a personal choice, but they also involve public health. The author is willing to walk away if their partner won't meet them halfway. The question is whether the ultimatum is justified.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after agreeing initially. The author is respecting their own values and the health of the children. The ultimatum is a personal boundary, which might be seen as reasonable because it's about the child's well-being. However, some might argue that it's extreme to end a relationship over this. But given the author's profession and the serious health implications, it's a valid concern.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons (e.g., conspiracy theories about Big Pharma) are not based on credible evidence. The author has tried to provide data and facts but hasn't convinced her. The author's decision to set a firm boundary is about protecting the child's health, which is a parent's responsibility.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author is being respectful and not coercive, just stating their non-negotiable boundary, they might not be at fault. However, the ultimatum could be seen as extreme. But considering the context\u2014health of the child, the fianc\u00e9e's change of heart\u2014it's a personal choice. \n\nSo, between A and B, the answer is likely B. The author is not in the wrong because they are setting a necessary boundary for their child's health, and the fianc\u00e9e broke the initial agreement. The ultimatum is a reflection of the author's priorities and values, which are valid.\n"
