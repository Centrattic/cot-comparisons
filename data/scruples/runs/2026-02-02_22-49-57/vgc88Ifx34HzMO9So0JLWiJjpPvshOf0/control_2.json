Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. The situation involves a disagreement over vaccinating their future children.\n\nFirst, the author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussions about alternative schedules, possibly from other countries, to address her concerns about \"overloading the baby's body.\" They agreed the kids would be vaccinated but with some flexibility. However, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e becomes more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk of transmitting Hep B and sets a limit: the baby can't go a month without starting some schedule. The fianc\u00e9e now accuses the author of manipulation and abuse for giving an ultimatum. The author feels justified, having tried to present evidence from WHO and CDC, but the fianc\u00e9e remains unconvinced. The author is considering walking away if their stance isn't accepted.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The key points are: mutual agreement initially, the fianc\u00e9e's change in stance, the author's ultimatum, and the fianc\u00e9e's reaction.\n\nThe author tried to compromise by allowing a modified schedule. They set a boundary based on their professional concerns. Ultimatums in relationships can be problematic if they're controlling, but here it's about a non-negotiable issue for the author. The fianc\u00e9e, however, changed her stance after agreeing previously. The author's actions might be seen as standing by their values, but giving an ultimatum can strain relationships. However, both parties have the right to their beliefs, and the author isn't forcing vaccination but setting a limit. The fianc\u00e9e's accusations of manipulation and abuse might be valid if the ultimatum is perceived as coercive. But the author's stance is about their child's health, which is a significant concern. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid points, but the author is asserting their boundaries. The answer hinges on whether setting a non-negotiable limit is wrong. Since the author tried compromise and the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
