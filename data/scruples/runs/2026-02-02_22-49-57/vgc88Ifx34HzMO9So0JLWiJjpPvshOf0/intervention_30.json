Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me start by going through the details provided.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9 who is a healthcare worker. He knew his fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and they had discussed alternative vaccine schedules. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated but with some adjustments. Now, after being engaged for a month, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, specifically the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author sets an ultimatum: either follow a modified schedule starting at one month or he can't continue the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling him manipulative and abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is being reasonable. He's a healthcare worker, so he's likely aware of the importance of vaccines. He's given his fianc\u00e9e a compromise before (alternative schedules from different countries), but now she's more opposed. The author is setting boundaries based on his own health and safety concerns, especially in his profession. The Hep B vaccine at birth is standard in the US partly because healthcare workers can potentially carry it, even if unlikely. The author is trying to mitigate risk.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's stance has changed. Initially, she was willing to work towards vaccination, but now she's against them entirely, citing Big Pharma conspiracies and denial of vaccine efficacy. The author has tried presenting data, but she's not budging. He's given her a clear ultimatum, which she's now taking issue with, calling it manipulative.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. He's standing by his decision to have vaccinated children, which he's communicated from the start. The ultimatum is about sticking to his non-negotiable boundary. However, giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be seen as extreme, but if both parties had discussed it beforehand and the author made his position clear, maybe it's justified.\n\nOn one hand, he's respecting his own values and health concerns. On the other, the fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured if she wasn't expecting such a strict stance. However, since they discussed it before engagement and she agreed, maybe it's fair. Also, the author is not refusing vaccines entirely but allowing a modified schedule. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge and conspiracy theories complicate things.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, setting boundaries is okay, but the method of delivering ultimatums can be a point of contention. However, the author's profession and personal beliefs add context. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance after agreeing before might be a red flag for the author, leading him to make a firm decision.\n\nSo, considering all factors, I think the author isn't in the wrong. He's stood by his decision after prior agreement and is protecting his health and the child's. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to compromise now might make her the one at fault. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
