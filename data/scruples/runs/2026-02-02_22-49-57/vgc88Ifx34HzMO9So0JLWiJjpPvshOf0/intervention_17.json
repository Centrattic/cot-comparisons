Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, some background: The author knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules, like maybe following a different country's plan, to ease her concerns about overloading the baby. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month, the fianc\u00e9e is bringing it up again, being extremely against Hep B at birth and questioning the necessity. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the baby's safety and risk of exposure. They set a limit of a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is now upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive for giving an ultimatum. The author wants the relationship to continue but is willing to walk away if she doesn't agree.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nHmm. The author made a decision based on their professional background and health concerns. They tried to compromise by allowing an alternative schedule and a one-month delay. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, has strong anti-vaccine beliefs and isn't budging despite evidence. The author is standing by their decision because vaccines are a non-negotiable for them. Ultimatums can be a sensitive topic in relationships, but in this case, the author's stance is about their children's health. \n\nBut is giving an ultimatum on such a personal and important matter considered wrong? It depends on cultural and personal values. In a relationship, both partners have rights to their beliefs, but when it comes to health decisions for children, there might be a point where one's values can't be compromised. The author tried to meet in the middle, but the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept even a modified schedule might be the issue here. \n\nThe key points are: the author had prior discussions, tried to find a middle ground, and set a reasonable limit. The fianc\u00e9e's sudden change in stance and refusal to accept the compromise could be the root problem. The author isn't forcing the traditional schedule but allowing a delay. So, in this context, the author's stance seems justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
