Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their fianc\u00e9e over vaccines. So first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author mentions they knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had previously discussed alternative schedules, maybe from other countries, to make her comfortable. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after being engaged a month, she's bringing it up again, being against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. She's not in a medical facility, no lab records, so the baby wouldn't be exposed. The author, being a healthcare worker, wants to minimize any risk of the baby getting sick from others. They set an ultimatum: the baby can't go unvaccinated past one month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive. She initially agreed to work towards vaccination but now isn't. The author tried showing data from WHO, CDC, statistics on disease vs. vaccine complications, but she's still against vaccines, thinking it's a Big Pharma scam. The author is now considering walking away if she doesn't agree.\n\nNow, to decide if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are consent, communication, and ultimatums in a relationship. The author had prior discussions and set boundaries. They offered a compromise with a delayed schedule. However, ultimatums in any relationship can be heavy, especially when it's about personal beliefs and future children. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance, maybe feeling pressured. The author's stance is firm due to their profession and risk aversion. But is giving an ultimatum wrong? It depends. If both sides had equal input and the decision is about a child's health, it's a tough spot. The fianc\u00e9e feels the author is being controlling, but the author has valid concerns. Legally, parents have rights, but in a relationship, both should agree. If the fianc\u00e9e is nonvax and the author is pro-vax, a significant disagreement exists. The author tried to meet halfway. However, forcing a partner into a decision they're uncomfortable with might be seen as controlling. But the author is standing by their principles. The question is whether being firm on this issue without coercion is wrong. The author didn't force her to get vaccinated, just set a limit on the baby's vaccination schedule. The fianc\u00e9e might feel her autonomy is invaded, especially if she's against vaccines for personal reasons. The author's actions might be seen as reasonable if they had prior agreements and are protecting the child's health. However, if the ultimatum is making her feel pressured, maybe the approach is harsh. But the author isn't forcing her to vaccinate; they're stating their maximum limit. So, it's a complex situation. The answer hinges on whether the author overstepped by setting a firm boundary or if they're within their rights to prioritize their child's health as per their beliefs. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they communicated and set boundaries, but it's a close call. So the answer would be B.\n"
