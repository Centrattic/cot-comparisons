Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is engaged and wants their kids to be vaccinated. They had already discussed an alternative schedule with their fianc\u00e9e before getting engaged. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed to vaccines, especially the Hep B shot at birth. The author gives an ultimatum: either the baby gets vaccinated by one month or they follow an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author is firm on vaccinations, which is their right as a parent. They even proposed a middle ground with a delayed schedule. They mentioned being a healthcare worker, which probably reinforces their trust in vaccines. But the fianc\u00e9e is changing her stance, which could cause conflict. The author is setting a boundary, which is understandable, but is it overstepping?\n\nNow, the key points: Did they have a prior agreement? Yes, before engagement they talked about following some alternative schedule but agreed on vaccinations. Now the fianc\u00e9e is not buying it anymore. The author is giving a time limit for vaccination, which is a form of ultimatum. The fianc\u00e9e feels pressured and accuses the author of being manipulative.\n\nIs the author wrong for setting a firm boundary on something they consider important? Parents do have the right to make healthcare decisions for their children, but when it's a joint decision with a partner, conflict arises if one isn't on board. The author is trying to protect the child's health based on their profession and research. However, using an ultimatum could be seen as coercive, but it's also about non-negotiable values. The fianc\u00e9e's stance is based on misinformation, which the author has tried to address with data but she's not budging.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The author tried to find a middle ground but is now at a breaking point. The question is whether setting a firm limit is wrong. If the author is willing to walk away over this, maybe they're standing up for their beliefs, which isn't inherently wrong. However, the way it's framed as an ultimatum might be seen as harsh, especially if the fianc\u00e9e hasn't had time to process or change her mind. But considering the health of the child, the author's stance is protective. It's a tough spot. The author isn't forcing the fianc\u00e9e to get vaccinated themselves, just deciding on the child's healthcare. So maybe they aren't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
