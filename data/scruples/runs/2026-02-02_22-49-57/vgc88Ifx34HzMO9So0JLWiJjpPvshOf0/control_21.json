Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is against vaccines, and the author is giving her an ultimatum. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they discussed vaccines before getting engaged, and they agreed that the kids would be vaccinated, maybe on an alternative schedule. Now, after a month, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author is a healthcare worker, so they're concerned about risks and want to follow a schedule, allowing a one-month delay at most. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the ultimatum manipulative and abusive. The author is conflicted because they don't want the relationship to end but can't compromise further.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the initial agreement versus the current stance. The fianc\u00e9e changed her position after the engagement. The author set a firm boundary, which the fianc\u00e9e perceives as controlling. The author is using data and facts, but the fianc\u00e9e still isn't convinced, even with evidence. The author is a healthcare professional, which might add weight to their concerns. But is an ultimatum fair?\n\nWell, the author says they discussed this before proposing, and the fianc\u00e9e agreed. Now she's backtracking. The author is trying to find a middle ground, like a delayed schedule. But the fianc\u00e9e is now more adamant. The author is giving her a choice: accept the one-month delay or the relationship ends. Is that too much?\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their beliefs and wants to protect their future children. On the other hand, giving an ultimatum can feel controlling, especially if the fianc\u00e9e feels she wasn't heard. But the author already compromised by allowing an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to even consider the Hep B vaccine, despite the author's reasoning, shows she's not willing to meet halfway anymore.\n\nThe author's stance is about health and safety, which is a big deal. They're using evidence, which the fianc\u00e9e dismisses, citing conspiracy theories. That's a red flag in relationships. If someone is unwilling to listen to facts, it's hard to reconcile differences. The author is standing firm because they can't compromise on something so critical for their child's health.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They tried to find a middle ground, presented facts, and set a clear boundary when the fianc\u00e9e refused to budge. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart after agreeing before is a problem. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
