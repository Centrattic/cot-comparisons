Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9e who proposed to their partner while knowing they were unvaccinated. They had discussed alternative vaccination schedules before the engagement, agreeing that the kids would get vaccinated but maybe on a different schedule. Now, after a month of being engaged, the fianc\u00e9e is bringing up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk of the baby getting Hep B and wants to follow a schedule, giving a one-month buffer before starting any alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive for giving an ultimatum. The author is confused because they had previously agreed, and the fianc\u00e9e now seems more adamant against vaccines, despite data and examples like Japan's whooping cough cases and measles outbreaks. The author is considering walking away if the fianc\u00e9e doesn't agree.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author had prior discussions and set boundaries. They made their stance clear from the start. The fianc\u00e9e initially agreed but is now pushing back. The author is a healthcare worker, so they have professional reasons to trust vaccines. The issue is about a medical decision with significant public health implications. The author is giving a compromise (one-month delay) but the fianc\u00e9e is not accepting it. The author is using data and references to reputable sources to support their position, but the fianc\u00e9e is dismissive, even going as far as believing vaccines are a hoax and don't work. The author feels they can't compromise further and is willing to end the relationship.\n\nNow, considering ethical and relationship dynamics. In a relationship, both parties need to respect each other's core values and non-negotiables. The author's stance on vaccines is a non-negotiable because of their professional background and health concerns. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, has strong anti-vaccine beliefs despite evidence. The author is trying to find a middle ground (alternative schedule with a delay) but when that's rejected, they set a boundary. \n\nBut is setting an ultimatum wrong? Some might argue that being firm on a non-negotiable issue isn't wrong, especially when it's about the child's health. Others might think that using an ultimatum is too harsh if there's still room for discussion, but in this case, the author has already compromised. The fianc\u00e9e's stance is causing conflict and the author is protecting their values.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept evidence and her conspiracy theories (like Big Pharma) are problematic. The author is trying to ensure the child's safety, which is a parent's responsibility. The author isn't forcing vaccines but is setting a limit. \n\nIn terms of relationship advice, if both partners can't meet in the middle on a critical issue, it might be a sign of incompatibility. The author isn't being manipulative; they're standing by their principles. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might stem from fear or misinformation, but the author isn't responsible for that. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the author is not in the wrong. They've communicated their stance, offered a compromise, and now are upholding their boundaries. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept even a modified schedule after prior agreement is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
