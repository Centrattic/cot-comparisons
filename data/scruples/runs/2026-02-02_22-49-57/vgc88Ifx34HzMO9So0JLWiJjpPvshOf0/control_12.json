Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. The background is that the fianc\u00e9e is unvaccinated and is against vaccinating the children, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is pro-vaccines and has set a limit of a one-month delay before following an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is now upset, calling it manipulative and abusive, even though they had discussed this before getting engaged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made their stance clear from the start of the relationship. They discussed the issue before proposing and had agreed on some alternative schedule. Now, after being engaged for a month, the fianc\u00e9e has changed her mind and is more opposed than ever. The author is standing firm because they can't compromise further on their health beliefs, especially given their job in healthcare.\n\nThe question is whether setting such an ultimatum is wrong. From the author's perspective, they've tried to find a middle ground by allowing a delayed schedule. They provided evidence from WHO and CDC, but the fianc\u00e9e remains unconvinced. The author is a healthcare worker, which adds weight to their concern about risks, even if small.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e feels pressured, and the author is being accused of manipulation and abuse. The ultimatum could be seen as a last resort, given the importance of vaccines to the author. But relationships require compromise, and maybe the author didn't leave enough room for negotiation.\n\nHowever, the author tried to meet halfway and now is setting a clear boundary. If the fianc\u00e9e refuses to meet the author's minimum requirement, then the author is not in the wrong for not backing down. They can't force someone to agree with their health decisions, especially when it's a core value. The fianc\u00e9e's unwillingness to budge despite evidence might indicate she's not open to compromise, which is her issue.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they made their position clear, tried to find a solution, and are now setting a firm boundary. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is extreme, and the author's decision is based on their professional and ethical beliefs.\n"
