Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is unvaccinated and against vaccines, and the author is giving an ultimatum about their future child's vaccination schedule. The author mentions they had prior discussions and agreed on some alternative schedule. Now the fianc\u00e9e is opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth, and the author is giving her an ultimatum: either accept the delayed schedule or break up. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made it clear from the start that they wanted their children vaccinated. The fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to work towards that but now is against it. The author is a healthcare worker, so they have a professional stake in preventing disease spread. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are based on distrust in big pharma and beliefs that vaccines don't work, despite evidence. The author is giving a compromise (delaying vaccines by a month) but the fianc\u00e9e is not accepting, leading to conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a rights perspective, each person has the right to make their own medical decisions, but when it comes to children, parents have a responsibility to act in the child's best interest. The author is prioritizing the child's health based on medical guidelines. The fianc\u00e9e's stance is based on misinformation or conspiracy theories. The author is giving a compromise, but the fianc\u00e9e isn't budging. The author is not forcing vaccination immediately but is setting a boundary. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any vaccination schedule might be the issue here. The author is trying to protect the child, which is a parent's duty. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting this boundary. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be due to her own rigid stance. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
