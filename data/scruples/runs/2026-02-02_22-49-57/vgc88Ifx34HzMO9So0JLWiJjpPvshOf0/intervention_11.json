Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The question is about whether giving an ultimatum over vaccines to a fianc\u00e9e is acceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules and agreed the kids would be vaccinated. After engagement, the fianc\u00e9e became more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and set a firm line: letting the baby go one month before starting an alternative schedule. Now the fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. The author is confused because they thought they had an agreement before, but she's changed her stance. They provided data but she's still against it. The author is considering walking away if she doesn't agree.\n\nSo, the key points here are: prior discussion and agreement, the fianc\u00e9e's change of heart, the ultimatum given by the author, and the fianc\u00e9e's reaction. The author's position is that they're standing firm on their values regarding vaccination, which they consider important for the children's health. The fianc\u00e9e feels pressured and it's causing conflict.\n\nNow, to decide if the author is wrong. In relationships, both partners should respect each other's values and boundaries. The author made their stance clear from the start and tried to compromise by offering an alternative schedule. However, when the fianc\u00e9e changed her position, the author set a clear boundary. But the ultimatum might be seen as extreme. Even though the author had valid reasons, using an ultimatum can be seen as inflexible, especially in a committed relationship where both partners need to negotiate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is prioritizing the children's health based on their profession and understanding of medical data. The fianc\u00e9e's stance is against evidence-based medicine, which the author has tried to address with data without success. The author's ultimatum might be a way to ensure their values are upheld in their children's upbringing.\n\nBut is it wrong? It's a tough call. The author is standing up for their beliefs, which is important. However, relationships require flexibility and mutual respect. If the fianc\u00e9e genuinely changed her mind and the author isn't willing to adjust, it could be seen as the author not respecting her autonomy or being too rigid. However, the author did set boundaries early on, which is fair.\n\nConsidering all this, maybe the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They made their expectations clear and tried to find a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart complicates things, but the author's decision to set a firm line is about their child's health, which is a significant concern. The question is whether an ultimatum is acceptable. In some contexts, it's a way to enforce personal boundaries, especially around health. However, in a relationship, ultimatums can be damaging. But given the circumstances, the author's position seems justified. So, leaning towards B.\n"
