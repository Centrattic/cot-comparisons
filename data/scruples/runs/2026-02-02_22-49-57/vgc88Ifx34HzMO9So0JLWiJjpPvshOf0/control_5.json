Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e over vaccines. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the background: The couple had discussed vaccine schedules before marriage, agreeing that the kids would be vaccinated but maybe following an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is now more opposed, especially to Hep B at birth, even though she has no risk factors. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and has set a firm line\u2014vaccinating within a month, otherwise the author might walk away. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author made their stance clear from the start, and they had an agreement. However, the fianc\u00e9e changed her position, becoming more anti-vax. The author is a healthcare worker, so their concerns about safety and public health are probably valid. They're not saying no vaccines at all, just a slight delay. But the ultimatum is a big deal in a relationship. \n\nOn one hand, the author is standing by their values and health beliefs. On the other hand, relationships require compromise. By giving an ultimatum, the author is essentially saying the marriage depends on this issue. That might be seen as too rigid, especially if the fianc\u00e9e's stance is based on misinformation. However, the author has tried to provide evidence, but the fianc\u00e9e isn't budging. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if a person in a relationship cannot compromise on a core issue, is it their fault? The author isn't forcing the fianc\u00e9e; they are stating their non-negotiable line. It's their right to have boundaries, especially regarding their children's health. However, relationships need mutual respect. If the author is using this to control or manipulate, then yes. But based on the description, the author is trying to protect the child's health, which is a parent's responsibility. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's initial agreement and subsequent change in stance might complicate things. The author had communicated their position from the start, so the fianc\u00e9e might not have realized the author was so firm. But the author also made the choice to propose knowing the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated and had discussed alternative schedules. \n\nIn the end, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary on something they consider vital. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge, despite evidence, is a problem. The ultimatum is a last resort, which isn't uncommon in such cases. So, answer B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
