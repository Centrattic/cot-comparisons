Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong regarding the vaccine ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author proposed to their fianc\u00e9e knowing she was unvaccinated. They had discussed alternative schedules before, maybe even a different country's schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine for newborns. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the baby's health and the risk of disease, so they set an ultimatum: no more than a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive for giving an ultimatum, even though the author had previously stated their stance on vaccines.\n\nThe key points here are consent in a relationship, compromise, and the use of ultimatums. The author had made their position clear from the start, but the fianc\u00e9e's stance has hardened. The author is trying to find a middle ground with the one-month delay, but the fianc\u00e9e refuses to budge. The author is a healthcare worker, which might add weight to their concern. However, ultimatums can be seen as controlling, even if the issue is critical.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author is standing firm on their medical beliefs, which is valid. However, giving an ultimatum because of a core value difference (vaccines) can strain a relationship. The fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured, especially since she initially agreed to work towards vaccination but now is more against it. The author's use of the ultimatum might be seen as a deal-breaker, but is that the right approach?\n\nIn relationships, major issues like healthcare for children need mutual agreement. If one partner is unwilling to compromise on something that's a non-negotiable for the other, it could lead to the relationship ending. The author's stance is that they can't compromise further, which is their right, but whether that makes them the asshole depends on perspective. Some might say it's reasonable to walk away from a relationship where a partner is unwilling to meet them halfway on such a critical issue. Others might argue that giving an ultimatum is too harsh, especially if the fianc\u00e9e's beliefs are deeply held.\n\nThe author did offer a compromise (one-month delay), which is a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept that might lead others to side with the author. However, the ultimatum aspect\u2014saying \"take it or leave it\"\u2014could be seen as not allowing further discussion, which is a red flag in some contexts. But in cases where the issue is about the child's health, it's more of a non-negotiable for the author.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they've set clear boundaries based on their professional and personal beliefs. However, using an ultimatum might be seen as extreme, but given the importance of the issue, it's understandable. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be considered over-the-top if the author had already made their stance clear. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
