Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's take a look at this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e over vaccines. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author mentions they knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month, the fianc\u00e9e is more against it, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, being a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and sets a limit: the baby can't go a month without starting some schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative, and the author is considering walking away.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the ultimatum. The author is standing by their decision because of their strong belief in vaccines, which they've had since the start. The fianc\u00e9e's stance has become more anti-vax, despite prior agreement. The author is trying to find a middle ground with a delayed schedule but is firm on the one-month limit.\n\nIs the author right to do this? Well, in a relationship, both parties should respect each other's values and boundaries. The author made their stance clear from the beginning, and the fianc\u00e9e agreed. Now she's not honoring that agreement. The author is protecting their future child's health based on their knowledge and job. The ultimatum is a hard line, but the author is trying to compromise (alternative schedule with a one-month delay). The fianc\u00e9e, however, isn't budging and has changed her position more drastically than before.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and compromise. The author isn't forcing vaccines but setting a limit. The fianc\u00e9e's arguments seem unfounded (like the Hep B claim), and the author has provided evidence (WHO, CDC) which she's ignoring. The author isn't wrong for having strong beliefs and setting a boundary, especially when it's about their child's health. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction seems to be the problem\u2014she's not respecting the agreed-upon compromise and is now escalating the conflict.\n\nAdditionally, the author is a healthcare worker, so their concerns about safety and risks are professional as well as personal. The fianc\u00e9e's claims about big pharma and vaccines not working are conspiracy theories, which the author has tried to counter with data. It's the fianc\u00e9e who's not being flexible here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They've tried to find a middle ground, set clear boundaries, and are standing by their decision after prior agreement. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance and refusal to honor the compromise is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
