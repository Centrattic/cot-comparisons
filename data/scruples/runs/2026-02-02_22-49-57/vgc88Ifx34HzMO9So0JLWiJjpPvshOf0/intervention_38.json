Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author proposed to their fianc\u00e9e knowing she was unvaccinated. They had previously discussed alternative vaccine schedules, maybe following another country's approach. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated in some form. Now, a month into engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk of the baby getting Hep B from others, since the fianc\u00e9e has no medical history or exposure. The author's max is a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative, and he wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe author provided background: they had discussed this before, and the fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to work towards vaccination. Now she's changed her mind. He tried showing data from WHO, CDC, Japan, etc., but she still believes vaccines are a hoax. He's giving her an ultimatum to agree or else the relationship ends.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the author is standing by a decision they made early on, based on health concerns. They tried to compromise by allowing a delay. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance, which complicates things. The author is in a healthcare role, which might inform their perspective. The fianc\u00e9e's stance seems more anti-vax now, despite prior agreement. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they tried to find a middle ground. They made their stance clear from the start. If someone can't compromise on a core value, especially regarding health, it's a valid reason to end a relationship. The fianc\u00e9e is now rejecting the agreement they had. The author isn't forcing vaccines but setting a boundary. \n\nBut maybe the ultimatum is too harsh? However, the author states they tried to find a compromise. The fianc\u00e9e isn't budging, and the author's position is about their children's health. It's a personal choice, but when it comes to medical decisions for offspring, it's a big deal. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They tried to meet halfway, made their position clear, and the fianc\u00e9e isn't compromising. Ending the relationship over fundamental disagreements on child health is understandable. So answer B.\n"
