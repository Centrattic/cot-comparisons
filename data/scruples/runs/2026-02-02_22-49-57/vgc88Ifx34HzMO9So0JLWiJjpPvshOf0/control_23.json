Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully. The person wrote about a situation where they set an ultimatum regarding vaccines for their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, they mention that they knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules, maybe using a different country's schedule, so she feels more comfortable. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated under some plan. Now, after a month of engagement, she's bringing up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author is a healthcare worker and wants to avoid any risk, even though they acknowledge the risk is low. They set a limit: the baby can't get vaccinated until one month old, then follow an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. The author is confused because she had previously agreed to work towards vaccination, but now she's against it. They tried showing her data from WHO and CDC, but she's still not convinced, believing it's a big pharma scam and vaccines don't work.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The author set a boundary because of their strong belief in vaccines. They tried to compromise by allowing a delayed start but not skipping entirely. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is now against vaccines altogether. The author is a healthcare worker, so they have personal reasons to avoid risking the baby's health. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after agreeing previously. \n\nOn one hand, ultimatums in relationships can be tough. If she had agreed before, maybe the author's ultimatum is a bit harsh now. But on the other hand, the author has a valid concern for their child's health. Vaccines are proven effective, and the author is a healthcare professional, so their stance is informed. The fianc\u00e9e's beliefs are based on misinformation or conspiracy theories, and the author is trying to protect the child. \n\nBut setting an ultimatum can be seen as manipulative, especially if the fianc\u00e9e feels pressured. However, in this case, the author is standing by their non-negotiable position due to health reasons. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart might have been a deal-breaker. \n\nThe key points are: prior agreement, change in stance, ultimatum based on health concerns, and the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept evidence. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they tried to compromise and have a legitimate reason based on their profession and understanding of health. The fianc\u00e9e's intransigence is based on misinformation. So the answer is B.\n"
