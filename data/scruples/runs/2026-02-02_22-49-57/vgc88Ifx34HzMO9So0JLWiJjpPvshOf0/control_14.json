Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is against vaccinating their future children, and the author is giving her an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions they knew she was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more opposed, especially to Hep B at birth. The author, being a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and wants to start vaccinations within a month. He gives her an ultimatum, which she's calling manipulative and abusive. She initially agreed to work towards it but now isn't. He's researched data, shown her evidence, but she's still against vaccines, claiming it's a big pharma ploy and vaccines don't work. He's willing to walk away if she doesn't agree.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, making decisions about children's health is a big deal. The author is setting a boundary he's comfortable with, which is important. However, giving an ultimatum in a relationship is a significant step. The fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured, especially if she previously agreed but changed her mind. But she's also being firm in her stance despite evidence. \n\nIn relationships, major disagreements can lead to hard choices. The author is trying to protect his values and the child's health. But is it fair to force her to choose between the child's vaccination or the relationship? Some might argue that while health is crucial, the ultimatum is extreme. Others might say he's within his rights to set non-negotiables for his children. \n\nThe key points are whether the author's stance is reasonable and if the ultimatum is justified. Since he's a healthcare worker, his concerns about safety are valid. He's also given her options (alternative schedules with a delay), not zero vaccines. However, she might feel he's not respecting her views enough. But considering she changed her mind after agreeing initially, he's standing his ground. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on cultural or personal values. If the community values vaccination and parental rights, the author might be seen as not wrong. But if there's a push for respecting a partner's changing views, maybe he is. However, since the child's health is involved, he might not be in the wrong. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance.\n"
