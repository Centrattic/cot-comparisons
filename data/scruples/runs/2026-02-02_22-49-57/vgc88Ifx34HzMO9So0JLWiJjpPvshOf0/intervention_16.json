Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. The author is a healthcare worker who has always been pro-vaccine and proposed a modified schedule to accommodate the fianc\u00e9e's concerns. They gave a month before starting a different schedule, but the fianc\u00e9e is now against any vaccines, calling the author manipulative and abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The fianc\u00e9e agreed initially to work towards vaccination but is now refusing. The author has tried to present data and evidence, but the fianc\u00e9e remains unconvinced, even claiming vaccines are a hoax. The author is firm on their stance because of their profession and the risk involved, especially with Hep B. They set a clear boundary and are willing to walk away if the fianc\u00e9e can't accept it.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is wrong. The key points are consent in the relationship, mutual agreement on parenting decisions, and the use of an ultimatum. The author proposed a compromise before the engagement, but the fianc\u00e9e is now not honoring that agreement. The author's stance is based on their professional judgment and concern for the child's health. However, using an ultimatum can be seen as extreme, but in this case, it's about a non-negotiable issue for the author. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart might be a problem, but the author is standing by their principles. It's a tough situation where both parties have valid points, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting clear boundaries on a matter they consider critical.\n"
