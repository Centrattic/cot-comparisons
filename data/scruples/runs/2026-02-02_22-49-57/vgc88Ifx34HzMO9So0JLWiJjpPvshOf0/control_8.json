Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e about vaccines. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and they had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and has set a limit: the baby can't wait more than a month before starting some alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement versus the current stance. The author had set a clear boundary based on their profession and beliefs. The fianc\u00e9e changed her position, becoming more anti-vax. The author is firm, citing data and the importance of vaccination, while the fianc\u00e9e is refusing to budge despite evidence.\n\nNow, considering the moral aspect. Is it wrong to set a non-negotiable limit on something as critical as child health? Vaccines are a public health issue with extensive research supporting their safety and efficacy. The author's stance is based on professional expertise and concern for the baby's health. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal might stem from misinformation, which the author has tried to address with facts but hasn't succeeded.\n\nHowever, ultimatums in relationships can be tricky. If the author is using a firm stance without room for discussion, it might be seen as controlling. But the fianc\u00e9e also agreed initially to work towards vaccination and now is not honoring that agreement. The author's concern is about the child's health, which is a parent's responsibility.\n\nPotential issues: Was the initial agreement clear? The author mentioned that the fianc\u00e9e had agreed in the past to work towards vaccination. Now she's backtracking. The author is respecting her desire for an alternative schedule but has a limit. The ultimatum is framed as a compromise (one month delay), but she sees it as manipulative. \n\nThe author isn't forcing her to vaccinate immediately but is setting a boundary. The fianc\u00e9e's strong opposition and refusal to consider evidence could be a deal-breaker. The author is prioritizing the child's health and their professional judgment. \n\nIn terms of fault, if the author had discussed this ultimatum earlier and was transparent, maybe they're in the right. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without prior warning. The author is not in the wrong for standing by their decision to protect the child's health, especially with the data on their side. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence might make her more at fault. However, giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be seen as harsh, but it's about a critical health issue. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). They are upholding a prior agreement and protecting the child's health based on professional knowledge.\n"
