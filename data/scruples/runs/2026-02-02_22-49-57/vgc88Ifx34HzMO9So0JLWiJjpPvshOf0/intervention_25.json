Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, the background: They were already discussing alternative vaccine schedules before getting engaged. The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated and had concerns about overloading the baby's body. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated, just maybe on a different schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk and wants the baby to start vaccines by one month old. He gives an ultimatum, and she's upset, calling him manipulative and abusive.\n\nThe author argues that he made his stance clear from the start. He's tried to find a middle ground with an alternative schedule but she's not budging. He's presented data from WHO and CDC, but she's still against vaccines, claiming they're a hoax and a big pharma scheme. He's a healthcare worker, so he understands the risks and benefits better. He's not forcing the Hep B vaccine but wants to delay it only by a month. \n\nNow, considering both sides. The fianc\u00e9e might feel that he's being controlling, especially if she's not convinced by the data. However, the author has made his position clear and tried to compromise. The key points are that they discussed this before engagement, there was prior agreement, and the ultimatum is based on the author's health care knowledge and risk assessment. The fianc\u00e9e's stance has changed, which complicates things. \n\nThe question is whether the ultimatum is wrong. If they had an agreement and she's now refusing to follow it, the author is within his rights to set boundaries. The Hep B vaccine at birth is a standard recommendation, and delaying it might not be a big issue if the baby isn't at risk. The author is trying to balance his concerns with her wishes. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's standing by his prior agreement and health concerns. He's given her a reasonable alternative, and she's not compromising. His ultimatum is about his non-negotiable point, which is reasonable since it's about his children's health. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any vaccination is where the conflict lies, not the author's decision to set a limit.\n"
