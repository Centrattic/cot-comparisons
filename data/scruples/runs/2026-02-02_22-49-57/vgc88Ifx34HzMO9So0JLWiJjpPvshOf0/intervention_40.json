Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. The author and fianc\u00e9e had previously agreed that the kids would be vaccinated, but now the fianc\u00e9e is more against it, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and wants a modified schedule but not to skip vaccines entirely. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive for setting the ultimatum.\n\nFirst, consider the context. They are engaged, so long-term commitments are at stake. The author had discussed vaccines before proposing and thought they had an agreement. The fianc\u00e9e's stance has become more rigid, even after seeing data and evidence. The author is standing firm because their professional experience likely gives them a strong conviction about vaccine importance. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence might indicate a fundamental disagreement in core values, which is hard to reconcile.\n\nThe ultimatum part is key. The author is saying that if she can't accept even a modified schedule, they can't move forward. Is that fair? Well, when you're planning to have children together, major decisions like vaccination schedules are critical. Both partners should be on the same page. The author tried to compromise by allowing a delayed schedule but has a limit. It's not about control but about protecting the child's health. The fianc\u00e9e, however, sees it as manipulation, but the author is setting boundaries based on their values.\n\nAnother angle: the fianc\u00e9e's initial agreement versus her current stance. She might not have realized how strong the author's position was, or maybe her views have changed. But once engaged, making life decisions like parenting styles should be mutual. The author isn't forcing vaccines but is clear about the non-negotiable aspects. The author's actions are about prioritizing their values, which is reasonable.\n\nHowever, giving an ultimatum can be seen as extreme. But in the context of a marriage where healthcare decisions are involved, it's understandable. The author is a healthcare professional, so their stance is informed. The fianc\u00e9e's rejection of evidence and conspiracy theories about vaccines suggest she isn't open to reason, making compromise difficult. The ultimatum is a last resort when dialogue isn't working.\n\nSo, balancing the need to protect the child's health against the relationship's future. The author isn't in the wrong for setting a limit they can't cross. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be emotional, but the author is justified in not accepting a position that could harm the child. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
