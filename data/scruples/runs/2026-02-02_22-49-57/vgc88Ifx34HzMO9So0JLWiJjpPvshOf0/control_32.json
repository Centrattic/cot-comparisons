Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is engaged and wants their children to be vaccinated. They knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing, and they had previously discussed alternative schedules, maybe even from another country. They agreed that the kids would get vaccinated under some schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is bringing up her opposition again, specifically to the Hepatitis B vaccine at birth. The author is a healthcare worker and is concerned about the risk of the baby getting diseases if unvaccinated, so they set a limit: the baby can't go unvaccinated for more than a month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive for giving an ultimatum. The author is confused because they thought they reached an agreement before, and now the fianc\u00e9e is not buying any of the data or arguments they present. The TLDR is that the fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax, the author offers a slightly delayed schedule as the maximum, and she's upset about the ultimatum.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. First, the author was aware of the fianc\u00e9e's stance before proposing, and they had a prior agreement. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is backtracking. The author is standing by their belief in vaccination, based on their healthcare background and data from reliable sources. The fianc\u00e9e is not only against vaccination but also holds conspiracy theories (like Big Pharma being involved). The author gives her an ultimatum but offers some flexibility (one month delay). However, the fianc\u00e9e is now upset and accusing the author of manipulation or abuse.\n\nOne angle is that the author is trying to protect the baby's health, which is a valid concern. Vaccines are generally safe and effective, as per WHO and CDC. The author is willing to compromise up to a point (alternative schedule with a one-month delay), which might not be a lot, but it's a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, seems to have changed her stance, which could be a problem. If they had an agreement, and she's now reneging on that, maybe she's the one in the wrong. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as extreme, especially in a relationship. It might depend on how the ultimatum was presented and whether it was fair.\n\nAnother point is that the author is a healthcare worker, which likely means they have more trust in medical science and public health guidelines. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept evidence and her strong anti-vaccine stance could put the child at risk. The Hep B vaccine at birth is a standard practice to prevent mother-to-child transmission, but the author notes the fianc\u00e9e isn't in a medical setting and has no risk factors. Still, the author is comfortable with the standard schedule and the small delay as a compromise. \n\nIs giving an ultimatum in the wrong? In relationships, ultimatums can be problematic because they force a choice, but if the issue is non-negotiable for one's health beliefs, it might be justified. The author is being upfront about their stance and the limits they're willing to accept. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction suggests she wasn't serious about compromising, which could mean she knew the author's line in the sand and is now backing out. But maybe the author should have considered other ways to handle it without an ultimatum, like continued dialogue or seeking counseling. However, the author has already tried presenting data and arguments, which the fianc\u00e9e is not accepting. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's accusations of manipulation and abuse are serious. The author might be seen as pressuring her into a decision, but since they had prior discussions and an agreement, it's a matter of following through. The question is whether the author's approach is reasonable. In this case, the author is setting a boundary based on their values and the baby's health, which is a common reason for such decisions. If the fianc\u00e9e can't meet that boundary, the author is left with the choice to walk away, which is their right in a relationship where core values are at stake.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They made an agreement, tried to find common ground, and are standing by their decision to ensure the child's health. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept this, despite prior agreement, might be the real issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
