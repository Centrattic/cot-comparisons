Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to address her concerns about overloading the baby. They had an agreement that the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is bringing up opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth, which she doesn't see as necessary because she's not positive for it. The author is a healthcare worker and is concerned about the risk of bringing diseases home. They set an ultimatum: the baby can't go a month without starting some schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is now upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive. The author is confused because the fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to work towards vaccination.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author had prior agreement, presented a compromise (alternative schedule with a one-month delay), and the fianc\u00e9e is changing her stance. The author is standing their ground, which the fianc\u00e9e sees as ultimatum-based.\n\nNow, considering ethics and relationships. In a relationship, both parties should respect each other's core values. Vaccines are a significant medical decision. The author's stance is based on public health data and their professional background. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is anti-vax, believing it's a hoax and that vaccines don't work, despite evidence. The author tried to meet her halfway with a modified schedule, but she's not budging. The ultimatum is the author's way of setting a boundary where they can't compromise further.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, everyone has the right to make healthcare decisions for their family, but when it comes to children, both parents typically have input. However, the author is trying to protect the child's health based on medical advice. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence might be seen as inflexible. The author isn't forcing her to agree but is saying that if they can't meet the compromise, the relationship can't proceed. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong because they've tried to find a middle ground and are now setting a firm boundary. The fianc\u00e9e is the one changing her position, not the author. The author's actions are about protecting their child's health, which is a valid concern. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
