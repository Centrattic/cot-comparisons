Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. I need to determine if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, I'll recap the situation. The fianc\u00e9e knew before the proposal that the author wanted their kids vaccinated. They discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to ease her concerns. But now, a month into the engagement, she's more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk of the baby contracting diseases, even if unlikely. The fianc\u00e9e is now calling the author manipulative and abusive for the ultimatum. The author set a limit of waiting a month before starting a modified schedule, but she's not budging despite evidence from WHO and CDC. The author is considering walking away if she doesn't agree.\n\nSo, the key points here are: prior agreement, change in stance, ultimatum given, and the fianc\u00e9e's reaction. The author is firm on vaccination, which is a personal health choice. The fianc\u00e9e's initial willingness to work towards it has shifted, and she's now anti-vax. The author is making their stance clear, which is a significant decision regarding their children's health.\n\nNow, considering the ethics and social norms. In relationships, major life decisions like parenting styles, especially medical ones, are important. Both partners should have mutual agreement. The author made their position clear from the start, and the fianc\u00e9e agreed. Now, she's not honoring that previous agreement. The author is trying to find a middle ground with an alternative schedule but has a limit. The question is whether setting that ultimatum is wrong.\n\nFrom a legal and parental rights perspective, both parents have a say in their children's health. However, the author is a healthcare worker, which might inform their decision. The fianc\u00e9e's stance is based on anti-vax beliefs, which are controversial and not supported by medical evidence. The author is prioritizing their values and the children's health, which could be seen as responsible. The ultimatum is a firm decision, but it's about a non-negotiable issue for the author.\n\nOn the other hand, relationships require compromise. If the author had given more leeway or was more understanding, maybe it would be different. But in this case, the author tried to meet halfway with alternative schedules but has a line in the sand. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence might be the root of the problem here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is standing by their values and the children's best interests. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart and refusal to compromise after agreeing initially might make the author not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
