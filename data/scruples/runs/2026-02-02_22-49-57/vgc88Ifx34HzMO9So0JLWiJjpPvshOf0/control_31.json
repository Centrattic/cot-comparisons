Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who's a healthcare worker. They knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules, agreed that the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially the Hep B at birth. The author gives an ultimatum: either they follow a modified schedule starting after a month or break up. The fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated and abusive, leading to the author's question if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, prior agreement, and the ultimatum. The author brought up the vaccination topic before the engagement and had an agreement. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is changing her stance, which the author can't accept. The author is in a healthcare field, which might influence their perspective on risk.\n\nI need to consider ethical aspects. Was there a mutual agreement initially? Yes. The fianc\u00e9e later changes her position, which the author isn't willing to compromise on. The author is setting boundaries based on their profession and beliefs. However, giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be seen as coercive, even if there was prior discussion. Also, the fianc\u00e9e's current stance might stem from misinformation, which the author has tried to counter with data but without success.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, ultimatums can strain trust and communication. Even if the author has valid reasons, forcing the fianc\u00e9e to choose between her beliefs and the relationship might be seen as manipulative, as she accuses. The author mentions that the fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to work towards vaccination, so maybe there was a miscommunication or misunderstanding about the extent of the compromise.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is standing firm on their non-negotiable stance for the children's health. They might believe it's a matter of principle, especially with their healthcare background. But relationships require mutual respect and compromise. If the fianc\u00e9e's beliefs are non-negotiable for her, and the author's are non-negotiable for him, the conflict is legitimate.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't in the wrong if they've been consistent and transparent from the start. However, the way they delivered the ultimatum could be problematic. There's a difference between setting boundaries and being coercive. The author might have tried to communicate their stance clearly, but the ultimatum could be seen as a power move rather than a collaborative decision-making process.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's change of heart might be due to deeper issues, like fear or mistrust in medical systems, which the author didn't address adequately. The author's approach of using data might not resonate emotionally, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, considering all these angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were clear about their stance beforehand and are standing by their principles. However, the method of delivering the ultimatum could be seen as harsh, but the core issue is a valid difference in values. Therefore, the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
