Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed an alternative vaccine schedule, maybe from another country. But after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is now more against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk and sets a limit: the baby can't start any alternative schedule beyond one month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive for the ultimatum.\n\nThe author is questioning if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nKey points to consider:\n\n1. **Prior Agreement**: They discussed vaccination before the engagement. The fianc\u00e9e agreed to some schedule. Now she's changing her stance. The author is standing by their principles here.\n\n2. **Healthcare Worker's Perspective**: The author is concerned about risks, even if low. As a healthcare worker, their concern is valid. They\u2019re not pushing for full vaccination but a delayed schedule as a compromise.\n\n3. **Ultimatum Given**: The author's maximum is a one-month delay. It's a compromise but a firm one. The fianc\u00e9e feels pressured, but the author states they\u2019re not willing to go beyond their limit.\n\n4. **Evidence and Reasoning**: The author cites WHO and CDC data, showing effectiveness and low risk. The fianc\u00e9e is anti-vax, citing conspiracy theories. The author has done their due diligence in presenting facts.\n\n5. **Communication and Respect**: The author mentions they discussed this from the start. The fianc\u00e9e agreed initially but is now backtracking. The author is clear about their stance, which is reasonable. However, ultimatums can be stressful, but it's their right to set boundaries.\n\n6. **Potential for Abuse**: The fianc\u00e9e labels the author as manipulative and abusive. But the author isn't forcing her; they\u2019re stating their non-negotiable line. The fianc\u00e9e has a choice to accept or leave. It's a matter of differing values.\n\n7. **Moral Responsibility**: The author is prioritizing the child's health based on their profession and evidence. The fianc\u00e9e's beliefs are against scientific consensus. The author isn't wrong for valuing evidence-based practices.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is setting a boundary based on their values and concerns. While ultimatums can be tough, it's not inherently wrong if both parties understand the consequences. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart complicates things, but the author isn't the at-fault party here. So the answer is B.\n"
