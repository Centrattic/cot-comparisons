Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who is unvaccinated and strongly against vaccines, even after the author gave some leeway with an alternative schedule. The author is a healthcare worker and they had previously agreed on following some schedule. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is against the Hep B vaccine and the author set an ultimatum: either have the baby start on a modified schedule within a month or the author can't continue the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has clear boundaries and values regarding vaccination, which is important for public health. They\u2019re in a position where they can\u2019t compromise further because of their profession and the health risks they\u2019re aware of. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e has her own beliefs, which are anti-vaccine, and she's changed her stance after the engagement.\n\nThe author gave her an offer to adjust the schedule, which might be a middle ground. But the fianc\u00e9e is now accusing the author of being manipulative or abusive for setting a firm boundary. The key here is whether setting a boundary in a relationship is wrong, especially on a core value like vaccination. Relationships require mutual respect and shared values. If one partner can't meet the other's non-negotiables, it's a tough situation, but it's not necessarily the author's fault for not compromising further.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e previously agreed to the author's stance on vaccination before the engagement. Now, she's backtracking, which might be the root of the problem. The author is standing by their commitment, which is valid. So, the author isn't wrong in setting that ultimatum. It's about maintaining personal values and ensuring the child's health, especially in a healthcare worker's environment. The fianc\u00e9e's resistance to evidence and the change in her position post-engagement complicates things, but the author's actions are about upholding their own boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
