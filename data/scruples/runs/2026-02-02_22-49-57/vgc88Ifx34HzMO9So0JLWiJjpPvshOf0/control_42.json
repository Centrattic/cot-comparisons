Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe from a different country, to make her feel more comfortable. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated, just maybe not the standard US schedule. Now, after getting engaged for a month, she's bringing up the Hep B vaccine again, specifically against giving it at birth. The author's stance is that they can't go beyond a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule. They are a healthcare worker, so they're concerned about protecting the baby from diseases, especially since the risk of bringing something home is low but they don't want that risk. The fianc\u00e9e is now upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive for the ultimatum. The author feels they've provided data from WHO, CDC, and examples like Japan and measles outbreaks, but she's still not convinced. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. From a factual standpoint, vaccines are a medical decision that parents typically make together. The author is standing their ground based on their belief in vaccination, which is supported by major health organizations. However, giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be a significant issue. Even if the topic is important, the approach might affect the relationship's dynamics. The fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured or that her autonomy is being disregarded. The key points here are whether the author is justified in their stance and if the ultimatum was appropriate.\n\nThe author mentioned that they had agreed on some sort of schedule before, but now the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed. The ultimatum is about the maximum delay, which the author is willing to accept. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge, despite previous agreement, could be a red flag. However, the author is giving her a choice to take or leave it, which might be seen as a last resort when compromise isn't possible. \n\nOn one hand, the author is protecting what they see as the child's health, which is a valid concern. On the other hand, the ultimatum might be perceived as controlling, especially in a relationship where both should ideally have a say. The fianc\u00e9e's initial acceptance and current change in stance could indicate that her views are not settled, which the author might not have fully considered. But the author is a healthcare worker, which likely informs their decision with professional experience. \n\nI think the main issue is whether the ultimatum is the right approach. While the author has a strong argument for vaccination, using an ultimatum in a personal relationship can be problematic. It might depend on the context of their discussions and how respectful they were. The author seems to have tried to find a middle ground (alternative schedule with a delay), but if the fianc\u00e9e is now doubling down on her refusal, the author's decision to set a firm boundary could be seen as standing up for their values. However, the term \"ultimatum\" and the fianc\u00e9e's reaction suggest that the author's approach may have crossed a line. \n\nIn relationships, major decisions should be made collaboratively. If the author made it clear from the start that vaccination was non-negotiable, maybe the initial agreement was a compromise. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is reconsidering, which the author might not be open to. The author's decision to walk away if the fianc\u00e9e doesn't accept their maximum delay could be seen as a legitimate step given the importance they place on vaccination, but it's also a significant decision that affects both parties. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They have a valid concern supported by evidence, but the ultimatum might be the problem. The answer would likely depend on whether the author was flexible in the past and if the fianc\u00e9e's stance is a recent, unanticipated change. Since the author had previously agreed to an alternative schedule and now is setting a firm boundary, maybe they're within their rights. But the way it's framed as an ultimatum could be seen as controlling. \n\nLooking at similar AITA threads, often the person who sets a hard boundary on a major issue isn't necessarily in the wrong, especially if they communicated it upfront. However, the method of communication matters. If the author gave her a chance to discuss and find another middle ground, but the fianc\u00e9e was unwilling, then it's more about her being rigid. But if the author didn't leave room for negotiation and forced the issue, that's where being in the wrong comes in. \n\nThe author mentions they've tried to discuss and provide data, and she's even more adamant now. They also mention that she's never worked in a medical facility, so maybe her concerns are based on misinformation. The author is a healthcare worker, so their perspective is informed by professional experience. Given that, they might feel strongly that vaccinating is the right choice. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's position is supported by medical evidence, using an ultimatum in this situation could be seen as a controlling move. However, if they had communicated their stance from the beginning and the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind later, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for upholding their boundary. The answer could be B (No), but it's a close call. The main factors are the prior agreement, the importance of the issue, and the method of the ultimatum.\n"
