Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9 who knew his fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed vaccine schedules, maybe an alternative one from another country, but agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, she's bringing up her opposition again, specifically against the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author is a healthcare worker and is concerned about the risk of the baby getting Hep B from someone else. He's given her an ultimatum: either follow a delayed schedule (wait a month before starting vaccines) or he can't be in the relationship. She's upset, calling him manipulative and abusive. The author feels he's justified because he's stood by his beliefs and she's not budging despite evidence.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, let's consider the arguments for A. Maybe the ultimatum is too harsh? Some might say that giving an ultimatum over something as important as a child's health is extreme, especially if the other person's views are based on misinformation. Also, the fianc\u00e9e might feel coerced, even if the author is firm in his stance. There's also the aspect of respect in a relationship\u2014maybe the author should have tried more compromise or counseling before an ultimatum.\n\nOn the other hand, for B, the author has a valid concern about public health. Vaccines are a critical part of preventing diseases, and the Hep B vaccine at birth is specifically recommended to prevent infection from the mother or others. The author, as a healthcare worker, understands the risks. The fianc\u00e9e's views are based on conspiracy theories and misinformation, and the author tried to meet her halfway with an alternative schedule. Since she's not willing to budge despite evidence, the author is protecting his future child's health, which is a parent's responsibility.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e was aware of the author's stance before agreeing to the engagement. She said she would work towards it, but now she's not. The author is holding her to that agreement. Ultimatums in relationships are tough, but when it's about the health of a child, some might see it as necessary.\n\nI need to weigh these points. The key factors are the author's prior knowledge, the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to change despite evidence, the health risks, and the author's compromise. Since the author tried to find a middle ground and she refused, many might side with the author. However, some might argue that the ultimatum is too rigid. But considering the public health aspect and the author's position as a healthcare professional, the B answer (not in the wrong) seems more likely.\n"
