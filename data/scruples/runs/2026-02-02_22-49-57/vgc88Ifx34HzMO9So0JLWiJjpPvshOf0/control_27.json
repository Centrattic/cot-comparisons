Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9e and vaccines. The user proposed to his fianc\u00e9e knowing she was unvaccinated. They talked about alternative schedules, maybe from another country, so she's more comfortable. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated somehow.\n\nNow, after engagement, she brings up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth. She doesn't see how a baby could contract Hep B unless she's positive, which she isn't. The author is open to a delayed schedule but not to skip altogether. He's a healthcare worker, worried about the risks of not vaccinating and exposing the baby. He gives her an ultimatum: either follow a modified schedule or he'll walk away. She's upset, calling him manipulative and abusive. The author is confused because she agreed before but now it's a problem. He's tried showing her data but she's still anti-vax, citing conspiracy theories. He's willing to walk away if she doesn't accept the offer. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is standing by his non-negotiable stance on vaccines, which is important for health. He's given some flexibility (alternative schedule, one-month delay). The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, has changed her position after agreeing before. The author felt he had to give an ultimatum because he's not willing to compromise on his core values. \n\nBut is it right to give an ultimatum? In relationships, major decisions often require compromise. However, when it comes to health and safety, especially for their future children, some might argue that the author is justified in setting a firm boundary. The fianc\u00e9e's opposition is based on misinformation, which the author has tried to address, but she's not budging. \n\nOn the flip side, ultimatums can be seen as controlling, especially if not discussed thoroughly. The author claims they had prior discussions, so maybe the ultimatum is a result of her not following through. The fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured or that her autonomy is being disregarded. However, the author is prioritizing the child's health based on medical evidence. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's ultimatum was reasonable given the circumstances. He's made compromises, offered alternatives, but there's a limit. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any vaccination is a significant issue. The author is protecting his future child's health, which is a valid concern. So he's not necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
