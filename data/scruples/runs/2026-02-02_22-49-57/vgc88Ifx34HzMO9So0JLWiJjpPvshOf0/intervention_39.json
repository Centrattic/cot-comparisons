Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated but with some flexibility. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to Hep B at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and has set a limit: the baby can't start any vaccine schedule later than one month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative or abusive, even though she previously agreed to work towards vaccination. The author is now considering walking away if she doesn't comply.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author had prior discussions and set boundaries based on their professional knowledge and health concerns. They tried to compromise by allowing an alternative schedule. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e feels pressured, and the ultimatum might be seen as controlling, even if based on valid health reasons. \n\nBut the key points are: they had prior agreement, the author is making a final decision based on their own research and profession, and the fianc\u00e9e is changing her stance. The author isn't forcing vaccines but setting a non-negotiable limit. Since the fianc\u00e9e had already agreed before, the author isn't wrong for following through. However, the ultimatum might be harsh, but given the author's stance on child health, it's their choice to make. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They had clear prior communication and are standing by their decision based on their beliefs and profession. The fianc\u00e9e changed her position, and the author is holding to their boundary.\n"
