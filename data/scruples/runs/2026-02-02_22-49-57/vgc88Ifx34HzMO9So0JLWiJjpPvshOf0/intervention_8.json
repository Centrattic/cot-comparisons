Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9 who proposed to their partner knowing she was unvaccinated and had some alternative views on vaccines. They had previously discussed a modified schedule, possibly following a different country's approach to reduce her concerns about overloading the baby. Their agreement was that the kids would be vaccinated but under some alternative schedule. Now, after a month of being engaged, the fianc\u00e9e has become more oppositional, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth, which she doesn't see the need for since she's not in a medical environment. The author, being a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk of bringing home diseases and has set a limit: the baby can't start vaccines for the first month, then a modified schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is now upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive for giving an ultimatum. The author is trying to hold the relationship together but can't compromise further on vaccines, as they\u2019ve presented evidence from WHO and CDC, but the fianc\u00e9e remains unconvinced. The author is asking if they're the asshole for walking away if the fianc\u00e9e doesn't accept their compromise.\n\nSo the key points here are: the author had prior discussions about vaccines before proposing, had an agreement, but the fianc\u00e9e's stance has changed. The author is trying to find a middle ground (delaying by a month), but the fianc\u00e9e refuses, leading to the ultimatum. The author is in a healthcare job, which adds credibility to their concerns about disease transmission. The fianc\u00e9e is dismissing scientific evidence, believing in conspiracy theories about vaccines.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? The options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nFrom my perspective, the author is trying to find a reasonable compromise. They had an initial agreement, but the fianc\u00e9e's position has shifted. The author is not entirely refusing vaccines but is allowing a delayed start. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, is completely opposed and dismissive of evidence. The author is standing by their principles, which are supported by scientific consensus. The fianc\u00e9e is labeling the author's ultimatum as manipulative, which might be a deflection since she's not budging on her anti-vaccine stance. The author's compromise is a middle ground, so the ultimatum is a last resort when the fianc\u00e9e refuses to meet them halfway.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here because they're trying to respect their partner's initial concerns but have set a limit based on their own professional and health knowledge. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any compromise and reliance on misinformation is the main issue. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
