Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving a vaccine ultimatum to his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that he knew his fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and they had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and set a one-month window before starting an alternative schedule. He's given her data from WHO and CDC, but she's not convinced, even accusing him of manipulation.\n\nHe's asking if he's in the wrong for standing his ground and giving an ultimatum. The key here is whether his actions are reasonable. He's clear about his stance on vaccines and had discussed it upfront. He's compromising by allowing a delayed start, which is a middle ground. His fianc\u00e9e's position has hardened, and she's not willing to budge despite evidence presented. \n\nHe's not forcing her to vaccinate herself but is setting boundaries for their children. The ultimatum is about their future kids' healthcare, which is a significant decision. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to consider the data and the change in her stance after agreeing initially might indicate she's not open to compromise. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, he's trying to protect the child's health, which is a parent's responsibility. The fianc\u00e9e's beliefs, while she has the right to hold them, could lead to potential health risks. The author is upholding his values and making it clear where he stands, especially given his profession. \n\nHowever, using an ultimatum can be seen as extreme. But since they're planning to have children, this is a critical issue where values clash. He's given her time and alternatives, but she's not cooperating. The author's actions are about ensuring his children's well-being, which might justify his stance. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. He's made reasonable compromises and is standing by his principles for the child's health.\n"
