Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post (AITA) is in the wrong regarding the vaccine ultimatum they gave to their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before they got engaged. They discussed alternative vaccine schedules, maybe from another country, to ease her concerns. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated in some way. Now, after a month of engagement, she's bringing it up again, being more against vaccines, especially the Hep B at birth. The author is a healthcare worker and wants to follow a schedule, giving a maximum of one month before starting any alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive, and saying she agreed before but now isn't.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they don't want the relationship to end but can't compromise on vaccines. They presented data from WHO and CDC, but she's still against it, thinking it's a big pharma scam. He gave her an ultimatum, and she's upset about it.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent, compromise, and whether the ultimatum is justified. The author mentions that they had a prior agreement, but now she's changing her stance. The question is whether the author is wrong for giving an ultimatum over something they previously agreed on.\n\nIn relationships, making decisions about children's healthcare is a big deal. Both partners have the right to their beliefs, but when it comes to medical decisions affecting a child, there might be legal and ethical considerations. The author is standing by their commitment to vaccination, which is supported by public health data. However, giving an ultimatum could be seen as controlling if one party isn't willing to listen or compromise beyond a certain point.\n\nBut the author also says they tried to accommodate by suggesting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, is completely against vaccines, even when presented with evidence. The author's stance is that they can't accept complete refusal, hence the ultimatum. \n\nIt's a tough balance. On one hand, forcing a partner to comply with medical decisions is a form of control. On the other, the author is prioritizing the child's health based on their profession and evidence. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart after initial agreement complicates things. \n\nIn terms of fairness, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they communicated their stance early and tried to find a middle ground. However, using an ultimatum might not be the healthiest way to resolve such a contentious issue. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction (calling it manipulative) suggests she feels pressured, which could be valid if the ultimatum is non-negotiable without considering her perspective.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is upholding their commitment to vaccination, which is a reasonable stance, especially given their profession. But there's a nuance here where the method of communication could be seen as harsh. However, since both parties are adults and had prior discussions, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries.\n"
