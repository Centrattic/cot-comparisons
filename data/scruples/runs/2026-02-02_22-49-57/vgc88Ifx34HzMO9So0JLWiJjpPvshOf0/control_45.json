Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9 proposed to someone who was unvaccinated. They discussed alternative schedules, like maybe another country's plan, to ease her concerns about overloading the baby. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially Hep B at birth, which she thinks is unnecessary. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and wants a modified schedule with a one-month delay. He gives her an ultimatum: accept this or he'll walk away. She's upset, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and mutual compromise. The fianc\u00e9 had mentioned his stance on vaccines from the start of the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e agreed to work towards it, but now she's not on board. He's given her a specific boundary, and she's rejecting it.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author has a strong stance based on evidence and his profession. He's given some flexibility with the alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is firm in her beliefs, even after presented with data. The ultimatum is a way to protect his values and the child's health. But is it too harsh?\n\nIn relationships, major decisions like healthcare require agreement. If both can't meet, it's a dealbreaker. The author isn't forcing her to vaccinate in a strict schedule but allowing a modified one. He's also given her time to adjust. However, the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence might be a red flag. \n\nBut is the ultimatum manipulative? He's stating his non-negotiables, which is part of a healthy relationship. However, the timing (after engagement) and the fact that she felt pressured could be problematic. It's possible he should have addressed this earlier, but he did mention his stance early on.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's accusation of abuse is a strong one. Ultimatums can sometimes be seen as controlling, but given the importance of child health and prior discussions, it's a matter of differing priorities. The author isn't in the wrong for standing by his beliefs, especially when he's made compromises. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any vaccination plan is the core issue here. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
