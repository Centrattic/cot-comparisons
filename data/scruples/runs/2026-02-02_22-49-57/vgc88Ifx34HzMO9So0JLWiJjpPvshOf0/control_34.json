Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the question is whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9e was already unvaccinated when they proposed. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to ease her concerns about overloading the baby. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated under some schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, she's bringing up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk of the baby getting Hep B, even if it's very low. He's setting a limit: the baby can't go unvaccinated for more than a month before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling him manipulative and abusive. She initially agreed to work towards vaccination but now refuses. He tried showing her data from WHO and CDC, but she still believes vaccines are a hoax. He's now at the point of considering walking away if she doesn't agree. So, is he wrong for doing this?\n\nHmm. Let's think about consent and communication. They had a discussion before getting engaged, and she agreed to work towards vaccination. Now, she's changed her stance. The author is standing by his convictions about vaccines, which he's researched and is in his profession. But is it right to give an ultimatum on such a personal decision? On one hand, he's respecting his own values and the health of their future children. On the other hand, relationships require compromise, and she's feeling pressured. But they had already discussed this, so maybe he's not wrong for holding his ground. Also, Hep B at birth is a standard practice because the risk is higher if the baby is unvaccinated immediately. She's not in a high-risk group, which he acknowledges, but he's still cautious. Maybe his reasoning is valid. However, the ultimatum might be seen as controlling. But given that they had prior agreement, perhaps it's within their rights to expect her to follow through. The key is whether the ultimatum is fair. Since they had a prior agreement, maybe he's not wrong. It's a tough call, but if both sides have discussed it and he's setting his boundaries based on prior agreement, he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
