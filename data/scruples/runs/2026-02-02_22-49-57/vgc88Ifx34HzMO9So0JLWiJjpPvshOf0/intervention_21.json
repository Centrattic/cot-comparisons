Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author giving an ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e regarding vaccinating their future children. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe following another country's approach. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated in some form. Now, after a month of being engaged, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to Hep B at birth, even though there's no risk. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about disease risks and doesn't want the baby unprotected. They set an ultimatum: either follow a slightly delayed schedule or the author would walk away. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nThe author is confused because they thought the fianc\u00e9e had agreed to work towards vaccination. Now she's not on board. The author has tried presenting data from WHO, CDC, and examples like Japan and measles outbreaks, but she remains unconvinced, believing vaccines are a hoax. The author is torn but stands by their stance.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let me consider different angles. The author is setting a boundary based on their values and the health of their future children. They offered a compromise (alternative schedule with a one-month delay), which is reasonable. However, ultimatums can be stressful in relationships. But in this case, it's about a fundamental difference in parenting. The fianc\u00e9e's stance has shifted, and she's not budging despite evidence. The author is standing by their principles, which are supported by medical consensus.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that giving an ultimatum is extreme. But considering the importance of vaccinations for public health and the child's safety, especially since the author is in healthcare, it's a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9e's beliefs are based on conspiracy theories and misinformation. The author's compromise might be seen as reasonable. It's a matter of conflicting values where both are unwilling to compromise. In such cases, setting a boundary might be necessary.\n\nI think the key is whether the ultimatum is justified. Since the author made a compromise and the fianc\u00e9e isn't willing to budge, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept even the modified schedule, despite the author's flexibility, might indicate the issue is more about the author's stance than the ultimatum itself.\n"
