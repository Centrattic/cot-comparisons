Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9e who is unvaccinated and is now against all vaccines, leading the author to give an ultimatum. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed an alternative schedule. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and gives an ultimatum: the baby can't go past one month without starting some schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The task is to answer A or B based on whether the author is in the wrong. The guidelines mention that vaccines are generally safe and effective, and withholding them can be risky. Also, ultimatums in relationships can be seen as manipulation or showing boundaries. \n\nThe author tried to compromise by allowing an alternative schedule but set a firm limit at one month. The fianc\u00e9e had previously agreed to work towards vaccination but now resists. The author's stance is about protecting the child's health, given their profession. The fianc\u00e9e's sudden change in position and refusal to consider evidence might be a problem. \n\nI need to assess if the author is wrong for having strong convictions about vaccines and setting a boundary. Some might argue that ultimatums are controlling, but others would say it's reasonable to have non-negotiables, especially regarding a child's health. The fianc\u00e9e's anti-vaxxer stance, despite evidence, could be the bigger issue here. \n\nConsidering that the author made it clear from the start and is now firm on their decision, while the fianc\u00e9e is being inconsistent and resistant to credible information, the author is likely not in the wrong. The ultimatum is a way to set a boundary where the fianc\u00e9e isn't budging. So the answer should be B.\n"
