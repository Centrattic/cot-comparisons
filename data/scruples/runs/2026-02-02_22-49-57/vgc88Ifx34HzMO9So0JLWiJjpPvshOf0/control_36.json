Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is unvaccinated and the author is giving an ultimatum over vaccinating their future kids. \n\nFirst, the author knew his fianc\u00e9e's stance before proposing and they discussed an alternative schedule. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated but with some flexibility. Now, after a month, she's more opposed, especially to Hep B at birth. The author, being a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk and wants to follow a schedule but with a one-month delay max. He gave her an ultimatum, and she's upset, calling him manipulative. \n\nThe author is asking if he's in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, vaccines are a personal choice, and forcing a partner to vaccinate might be seen as controlling. But the author had made his stance clear from the start, and they had agreed on something. Now she's backtracking. The author is setting a boundary based on his beliefs and job. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. However, when it comes to health decisions, especially for children, people can have strong convictions. The author isn't forcing her to get vaccinated himself but is making a decision about their children. The fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured, but the author had communicated his position early on. \n\nThe question is whether the ultimatum is wrong. If both sides had agreed on a plan and she's now changing her mind without discussion, the author has a right to set his limits. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as extreme. But considering he's tried to find a middle ground (alternative schedule with a delay), maybe it's justified. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He's standing by his decision after prior agreement and has tried to accommodate her concerns. The fianc\u00e9e's sudden opposition might be the root issue here. The author isn't forcing vaccination but is setting a boundary that's important to him, given his profession and beliefs.\n"
