Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who's against vaccines, and the author is giving her an ultimatum. \n\nFirst, the author knew she was unvaccinated before proposing and they had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more opposed, especially to Hep B at birth. The author wants to wait a month before starting any schedule. He's a healthcare worker, so he's concerned about risks. She's calling him manipulative and abusive for setting this ultimatum.\n\nThe author tried to find data from WHO and CDC to convince her, but she's still not convinced, citing Big Pharma conspiracies. He checked his insurance and found vaccines are almost free. He's given her his maximum flexibility, but she's upset and he's willing to walk away.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he set boundaries based on his beliefs and health concerns. Vaccines are a personal choice, but in some cases, societal norms and public health guidelines are strong. The author isn't forcing her to vaccinate himself but her children. Since they're planning to marry and have kids, it's a shared decision. However, giving an ultimatum might be too harsh. But considering she agreed to work towards vaccination before and now is refusing, maybe he's justified in setting limits. It's a tough call. The key points are mutual agreement before, her changing stance, and his compromise. If she's not willing to budge despite evidence, his ultimatum might be his only option. So, not sure if he's wrong, but maybe not.\n"
