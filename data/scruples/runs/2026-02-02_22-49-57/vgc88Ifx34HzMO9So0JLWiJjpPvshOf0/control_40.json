Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who doesn't want to vaccinate their future kids, and the author is setting a limit where if the fianc\u00e9e can't agree to some vaccination schedule (even with a delay), then they can't stay together. The fianc\u00e9e is now upset and accuses the author of being manipulative or abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health perspectives. The author is a healthcare worker, so they probably have a professional stake in vaccinations. The fianc\u00e9e is against vaccines, thinking they're a hoax, and the author has tried to compromise with an alternative schedule. The author mentions they agreed before getting engaged that the kids would be vaccinated, but now the fianc\u00e9e is backing out. \n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. When they got engaged, the author had already discussed this and gotten an agreement. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is changing her stance. The author is trying to enforce what they believe is a non-negotiable part of their future family's health. But the fianc\u00e9e feels pressured because of the ultimatum.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, ultimatums can be stressful. The author is using the breakup as leverage, which can be seen as manipulative. However, the author is standing their ground on something they consider essential. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, didn't stick to the agreement they made earlier. \n\nVaccine hesitancy is a real issue, but in this case, the fianc\u00e9e seems to hold strong anti-vaccine beliefs, which the author has tried to address with data. The author's offer of a delayed schedule is a compromise, but the fianc\u00e9e isn't budging. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a toss-up. The author is trying to protect their children's health, which is a valid concern. But using a breakup as the consequence might be harsh. However, if the agreement was made before the engagement, the author isn't necessarily wrong for expecting the fianc\u00e9e to honor that commitment. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The author might not have properly communicated the importance of vaccines from the start, but they did mention they discussed it before proposing. The fianc\u00e9e changing her mind later adds to the tension. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is trying to uphold a prior agreement, and while their method might be seen as harsh, their stance isn't without merit. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to compromise despite prior agreement could also place some responsibility on her. But whether the author is in the wrong depends on how society views ultimatums in relationships. \n\nSo, given that the author tried to find a middle ground and the fianc\u00e9e didn't honor the initial agreement, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
