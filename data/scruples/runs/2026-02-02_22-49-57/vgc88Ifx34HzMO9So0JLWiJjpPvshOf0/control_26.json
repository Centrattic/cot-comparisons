Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is against vaccines, and the author gives an ultimatum. The author says they discussed alternative schedules before, but now the fianc\u00e9e is more against it. The author is a healthcare worker, so they have concerns about disease risks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both were in agreement initially for following some schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is now more opposed, even bringing up the Hep B vaccine at birth, which the author finds hard to justify. The author gives a time limit for starting vaccines, and the fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are mutual agreement, the ultimatum, and the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to compromise. The author has clear reasons based on their profession and health data. The fianc\u00e9e has changed her stance and is not swayed by evidence.\n\nIn relationships, major issues like child-rearing decisions can be deal-breakers. Vaccines are a significant health issue. The author tried to find a middle ground (alternative schedule) but is now at their limit. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any compromise might be the root issue here.\n\nBut is the ultimatum fair? Some might say that giving an ultimatum on such an important matter is extreme, but others might argue that it's reasonable when there's a fundamental disagreement on child health. The author isn't forcing the vaccines but setting a boundary. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction suggests she's not willing to respect that boundary, which could mean she's the one in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they discussed this before engagement, so the fianc\u00e9e was aware. The ultimatum isn't out of nowhere. It's based on prior agreements. The fianc\u00e9e's sudden change in stance and not being open to discussion might be her fault.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like seeking counseling. But given the circumstances, the author is standing by their non-negotiable stance. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
