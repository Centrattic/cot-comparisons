Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the scenario again.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9 who knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative vaccination schedules, maybe from a different country, to ease her concerns about overloading the baby. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated in some form. Now, a month into the engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is bringing up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth. She doesn't see the risk of Hep B since she's never been in a medical facility, etc. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the baby's health and wants to avoid the risk of diseases, not just vaccine complications. The author gives an ultimatum: the baby can't wait more than a month before starting some alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive, and they're in a conflict about ending the relationship. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Both parties had discussed vaccines before, and the fianc\u00e9e agreed to work towards vaccination. Now she's changed her stance. The author is a healthcare worker, which might influence their stance on vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e is anti-vax, citing Big Pharma and the vaccines not working, despite evidence to the contrary. The author gives an ultimatum, which is a firm stance but not immediate full vaccination; they allow a one-month delay with an alternative schedule.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author had discussed and agreed on the terms beforehand. The fianc\u00e9e changed her mind, which might be a problem. The author is standing by their non-negotiable line here. But ultimatums in relationships can be problematic because they force others into binary choices. However, in this case, the author is trying to protect the child's health based on their professional background. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence could be seen as inflexible. However, the author's ultimatum might be seen as controlling if it's not allowing any compromise. But they did offer an alternative schedule with a delay. \n\nLegally and medically, vaccines are considered safe and effective, and not vaccinating can put the child at risk. The author is prioritizing the child's health. But in a relationship, both partners should respect each other's values. The author had warned the fianc\u00e9e about their stance before proposing, so she knew what to expect. If she's now unwilling to compromise, that's a problem on her side. However, the author's ultimatum could be seen as pressuring her, especially if she's not on board with any vaccines. But the author's position is based on their own research and medical knowledge.\n\nI think the key is whether the author gave a reasonable compromise. The author offered an alternative schedule with a one-month delay, which is a middle ground. If the fianc\u00e9e is still not accepting any vaccines, then the author is justified in walking away because they can't have a child without vaccines. The author isn't forcing immediate full vaccination but wants to start a schedule within a month. The fianc\u00e9e is the one not budging. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Their stance is to protect their child, which is a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9e is in the wrong for not honoring the prior agreement and being anti-vax despite evidence. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
