Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author, engaged to someone who is unvaccinated, had prior discussions about vaccine schedules, including alternative ones. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risks of not vaccinating and sets a limit: the baby can't go a month without starting some schedule. The fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated and the author is considering walking away if she doesn't agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a clear stance on vaccines, which they communicated early on. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is now more anti-vax, despite previous agreement. The author's ultimatum is based on their health concerns and profession. But is it fair to give an ultimatum on such a personal matter?\n\nIn relationships, major decisions like vaccination can be contentious. The fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured, especially if the author is using a take-it-or-leave-it approach. Even if they discussed it before, her changed stance could be valid. Maybe she had more time to research or her beliefs evolved.\n\nThe author's reasoning is logical\u2014they want their kids vaccinated, and they're a healthcare worker. But ultimatums can be seen as controlling, especially when one partner's values are non-negotiable. The fianc\u00e9e might feel her autonomy is being disregarded. Also, the author's mention of the fianc\u00e9e's conspiracy theories about Big Pharma and vaccine efficacy might indicate she's not just hesitant but firmly anti-vax, which could be a deal-breaker.\n\nHowever, the author had prior discussions and was transparent about their stance. They tried to find a middle ground with an alternative schedule. The issue is whether it's reasonable to end the relationship over this. While the author isn't wrong in wanting their children vaccinated, forcing the issue might be seen as inconsiderate of the fianc\u00e9e's beliefs unless there's a legal or ethical imperative. But vaccines are a public health issue, and personal beliefs can clash with evidence. The author's stance is supported by public health data, which might justify their firmness.\n\nBut relationship dynamics matter. Ultimatums can be harsh. The fianc\u00e9e might feel that the author isn't respecting her views enough. However, if the author made their position clear from the start and the fianc\u00e9e didn't anticipate such a strict stance, maybe the problem lies in unrealistic expectations. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they communicated their stance and tried to compromise. However, giving an ultimatum on such a significant issue might be seen as extreme. But given the context and the author's profession, their insistence on vaccination is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart might not be considered in this analysis, but the author's actions are a response to her not respecting prior agreements. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here. However, in the context of the question, the author's actions are justified based on their values and prior discussions.\n"
