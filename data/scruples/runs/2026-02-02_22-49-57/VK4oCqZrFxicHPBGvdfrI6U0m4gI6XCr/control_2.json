Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent's partner is upset, thinking the kid should report to teachers instead of using violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other child is being overly physical, not respecting boundaries, even after being told by adults. The parent is trying to teach their daughter self-defense, using force when necessary. But the concern is that teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force might escalate the situation. \n\nAt that age, kids might not have the emotional maturity to handle such situations. The parent's approach is about self-defense in an immediate situation where the other child isn't stopping. However, the partner's point is valid too: maybe the kid should rely on adults more. But the teachers aren't effective here, so the parent is filling the gap. \n\nAlso, the parent emphasized using force only when necessary and mentioned running away and telling adults. So it's not about encouraging violence but using minimal force to protect herself. The key here is whether teaching a 4-year-old to push back is appropriate. \n\nThere's a balance between teaching assertiveness and teaching violence. Maybe the parent is right in this specific case because the other child isn't listening to adults or verbal cues. The parent's instruction is situational, not a general license to hit. \n\nBut some might argue that even at 4, pushing could lead to the other child reacting more aggressively. However, the parent did address the possibility of retaliation by advising pushing back or fleeing. \n\nOverall, considering the child's need to protect herself and the ineffectiveness of the teachers, the parent's advice seems reasonable. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
