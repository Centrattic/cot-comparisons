Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (parent) is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent and their spouse had a fight over this, so it's a bit of a moral dilemma.\n\nFirst, the context: the other child is being physically overbearing, even after being told by teachers to stop. The daughter is aware of this and has reported it, but the teachers aren't catching it, and the other kid isn't heeding their warnings. The parent is advising her to use \"legit force\" to protect herself if the kid won't stop, even though they generally teach non-violence. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to let the child handle it by telling the teachers and not using any violence at all.\n\nSo, the core issue is about teaching a young child to assert herself physically when verbal and adult intervention isn't sufficient. The parent argues that it's justified in cases of unwanted physical contact, while the spouse thinks violence should never be used. \n\nI need to consider if pushing back is appropriate for a 4-year-old in this context. On one hand, the child is experiencing uncomfortable or potentially harmful physical interactions. Teaching her to set boundaries is important for her safety. But on the other hand, encouraging physical retaliation might normalize violence, even if it's \"legit.\" \n\nAlso, the parent's approach might be seen as empowering the child to protect herself, which is a good lesson in personal space and self-defense. However, the spouse's concern is valid too\u2014using physical force could escalate the situation or make the child associate violence as an acceptable response. \n\nBut the parent isn't advocating for aggressive violence, just pushing back to stop the unwanted contact. The key here is distinguishing between defending oneself and initiating violence. At 4 years old, can a child understand that nuance? The parent believes she can, and that she's old enough to recognize when it's necessary to push away. \n\nThe spouse might be right in that ideally, children should use words and seek help, but if the system (teachers) isn't working, maybe the parent is trying to teach the child to protect herself in the moment. The parent's advice includes running away and telling an adult, which is still part of the solution. \n\nI think the parent is trying to teach the child to defend her own boundaries, which is a positive thing. However, there's a risk of the child learning that physical force is acceptable. But given the situation where the other child isn't stopping and the teachers aren't intervening effectively, the parent's approach might be necessary. The answer likely depends on the balance between teaching self-defense and avoiding normalization of violence. Since the parent is not promoting general violence but situational defense, and the child is already reporting the issue, I'm leaning towards the parent not being in the wrong.\n"
