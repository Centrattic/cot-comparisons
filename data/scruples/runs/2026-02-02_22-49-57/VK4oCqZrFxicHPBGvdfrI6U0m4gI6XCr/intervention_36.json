Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who encouraged their 4-year-old to push away another kid is in the wrong. The daughter is being hugged and kissed too forcefully by another child, and the parent told her it's okay to push back if the other kid won't stop. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being physically uncomfortable by another kid who isn't stopping even after being told. The parent is teaching self-defense, which is a way to protect the child. But since they're only 4, the methods taught might be too aggressive. Pushing back could escalate things. Also, the spouse's concern is valid because teaching a child to use violence, even for defense, could have unintended consequences. However, the parent's intention is to teach the child to protect herself when adults aren't around. The daycare teachers aren't responding effectively, so the parent wants the child to handle it herself. \n\nIn child-rearing, there's a balance between teaching assertiveness and avoiding violence. At 4 years old, the child might not fully understand the boundaries of appropriate force. The parent's advice was specific to a situation of being forced and not being able to stop it through words. So maybe it's about teaching self-advocacy. But the spouse is right to worry about encouraging violence in general. The parent's approach might be okay in the context, but the method of pushing or pushing back could be risky. \n\nI think the key here is whether the parent is teaching the child to defend herself in a way that's proportionate and safe. The parent isn't encouraging unprovoked violence but rather a defensive response to unwanted physical contact. However, for a 4-year-old, the parent might need to consider if the child can distinguish between a push to stop the hug and an aggressive act. The parent's advice is specific to a situation where the child is being harmed, which is a valid concern. The spouse's point about involving adults is also valid, but if the adults aren't effective, the child might need immediate strategies. \n\nSo, the parent is trying to protect their child's autonomy and safety. While the spouse's concern about violence is valid, the parent's intention is to teach self-protection in a specific context. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong, but the approach might need some refinement. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
