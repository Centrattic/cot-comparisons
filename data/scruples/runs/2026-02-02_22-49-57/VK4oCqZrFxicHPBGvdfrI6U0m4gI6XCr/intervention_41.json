Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully and kissing her against her will. The child has already told the teachers, but the behavior continues. The parent advises their daughter to use \"legit force\" if she feels uncomfortable, even suggesting pushing back or running away.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and safety. The other child's actions are clearly unwanted and could be considered a form of assault, even in a daycare setting. The parent is trying to empower their child to protect herself when adults aren't stopping the behavior. At 4 years old, kids might not have the verbal skills or the confidence to say no effectively, so physical boundaries become important.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of teaching violence. The parent is careful to distinguish between self-defense and using violence for no reason. They mention that they're not encouraging random aggression, just defending against it. The spouse is concerned about promoting violence, which is valid because teaching kids to hit or push can lead to cycles of aggression. However, in this case, the action is defensive, not aggressive. The parent is teaching their child to protect herself from unwanted physical contact, which is a form of self-defense. \n\nAnother angle is the daycare's responsibility. The fact that the teachers aren't catching it means the child isn't getting the necessary support from adults, so the parent is stepping in. But is it the parent's job to teach self-defense or should they rely on the daycare? It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the daycare isn't addressing the issue, the parent is trying to ensure their child's safety through immediate means.\n\nAlso, the daughter's response about the other kid pushing back suggests that the situation might escalate if she uses force. The parent's advice to push back or run away and tell an adult could help her avoid further harm. However, there's a risk that teaching a child to fight might lead to more conflict instead of resolving the problem through communication.\n\nBut considering the child's age and the fact that the behavior is persistent and unwanted, the parent is trying to equip their child with practical tools to handle a situation where adults aren't intervening. It's about setting boundaries and self-advocacy. The parent is teaching appropriate self-defense in a situation where the child is being physically forced, which is a valid concern.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's actions seem well-intentioned, aiming to protect their child from unwanted physical contact and empower her to set boundaries. While there's a valid concern about using violence, the context here is self-defense rather than initiating aggression. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
