Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away a kid who's hugging her too roughly or kissing her without consent. The parent and spouse had a disagreement over this. The parent argues that it's legitimate self-defense, while the spouse thinks the child should only report to teachers and avoid any form of violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The other child is being physically intrusive, and the daughter has already told the teachers without success. The parent is teaching the child to protect herself using physical force when necessary. At 4 years old, the child is very young, but the parent believes she can distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate behavior.\n\nLegally, I'm not a lawyer, but generally, self-defense principles allow for reasonable force to stop an immediate threat. However, this is a child's situation. The parent's advice here is about using force to stop unwanted physical contact, which is more about personal boundaries than violence. The key here might be whether pushing away is considered an acceptable form of self-defense for a child in this context.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse's concern is valid too. Encouraging a young child to use physical force could lead to unintended consequences. Maybe the child might escalate the situation or use it inappropriately elsewhere. Teachers need to be informed because their role is to manage such situations and prevent bullying or inappropriate behavior. The parent might be correct in teaching the child to assert her boundaries, but the spouse might be right in emphasizing the importance of reporting rather than fighting.\n\nThe parent says they are not encouraging violence but teaching the child to use \"legit force.\" The line between teaching self-defense and encouraging aggression can be blurry. However, given that the child is being physically forced into interactions she doesn't want, and the adults aren't stopping it, the parent's approach could be seen as empowering the child to protect herself in the absence of adult intervention.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the context. Since the child is being subjected to unwanted physical contact that's making her uncomfortable, the parent's advice is about maintaining personal space and safety. The alternative of just reporting might not work if the teachers aren't effective. Therefore, teaching the child to push away could be a necessary measure. However, the spouse's concern about using any form of violence, even minor, might stem from a desire to prevent the child from learning that physical force is an acceptable solution to conflicts, which could be problematic in other situations.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's merit to both sides, the parent's actions seem justified given the specific and immediate situation. The parent is responding to a real issue where the child is being physically overstepped, and the advice is about setting boundaries, not instigating violence. So, the author is probably not in the wrong.\n"
