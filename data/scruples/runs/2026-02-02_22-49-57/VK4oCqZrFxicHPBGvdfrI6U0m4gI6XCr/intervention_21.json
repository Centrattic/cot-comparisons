Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter is in daycare with another kid who's hugging her very hard and sometimes kissing her, even when she doesn't want it. The daughter has already told the teachers, but they aren't catching it because it's hard to see, and the other kid doesn't stop. The author told their daughter it's okay to push the kid away if it's uncomfortable and even to push back if necessary, or run and tell an adult. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to rely on teachers and avoid violence. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider different angles. On one hand, teaching a child to use physical force could be seen as promoting violence. But the other kid's actions are non-consensual and possibly aggressive, so the daughter has a right to protect herself. The author is distinguishing between \"legit violence\" (defending oneself) and other kinds. The daughter is 4, which is very young, so maybe the spouse is concerned about teaching her to use force at such an early age. However, the other child is not respecting boundaries, which is a serious issue. The daycare isn't handling it effectively, so the author is trying to empower their daughter to set boundaries. \n\nI should also think about child development. At 4 years old, children are learning about personal space and appropriate social interactions. If the other child's behavior is truly forceful and the daycare isn't intervening, the parent is trying to give the daughter tools to protect herself. The key here is that the parent is not teaching random aggression but rather self-defense in a specific context where the other child is being non-consensual. \n\nOn the other side, some might argue that even pushing back could escalate the situation. The spouse's point is valid; maybe the daycare should handle it without the children using violence. But if the daycare isn't effective, the parent is trying to find a solution. The parent is also emphasizing that it's only when the other child is hurting her and not stopping. So it's about setting boundaries, not just any conflict. \n\nI think the parent is not in the wrong because they are teaching their child to recognize and defend against non-consensual physical contact, which is important for safety and self-respect. The spouse's concern might be about potential escalation, but the parent's approach is about immediate self-protection when adults aren't available. So, answer B (No).\n"
