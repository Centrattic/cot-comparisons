Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent was wrong in advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who was hugging her too forcefully and even kissing her when she didn't want to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The other kid is the same age, and the parent saw the behavior. The daughter had already told the teachers, but the teachers couldn't catch it happening, and the other kid wasn't stopping. The parent told their daughter it's okay to push him away if the other kid is being violent and not stopping when she tells him to. The parent also mentioned that if the other kid pushes back or beats her, she should push back or run and tell an adult. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to just tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nSo, the key points here are about teaching a child self-defense versus conflict resolution. At 4 years old, children are still learning how to interact and handle social situations. The parent is trying to empower their daughter to protect herself in a situation where the other child is being aggressive. However, there's a concern about teaching a child to use violence, even if it's in self-defense. The spouse's argument is that non-violent solutions should be emphasized, like telling an adult.\n\nI need to think about what's appropriate for a 4-year-old. Teaching a child to use physical force might escalate the situation. Even if the parent says it's \"legit force,\" the line between self-defense and aggression can be blurry for a young child. The other child's behavior is concerning, and the parent is worried about their daughter's safety. However, the parent's approach might not be the best method. The teachers aren't able to address it, so maybe there's a need for a different strategy, like more direct communication with the other child's parents or the daycare, rather than teaching the child to push back.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions the daughter is \"clever enough to recognize the difference,\" but at 4, a child might not have the judgment to assess when force is appropriate. The parent's advice could lead to the daughter using force in other situations where it's not necessary. The spouse's concern about promoting violence is valid. The daycare's role is also important here; maybe the parent should work more closely with the teachers to find a solution, like separating the children during interactions or addressing the behavior more directly.\n\nIn terms of developmental appropriateness, 4-year-olds are still learning to express their feelings and set boundaries. Teaching them to use physical force might not be the best approach. Instead, encouraging them to use words, walk away, or seek help from an adult could be more effective. The parent's advice might be well-intentioned but could lead to unintended consequences, like the daughter feeling justified in using aggression in other contexts.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is right to be concerned about their daughter's safety and autonomy. The other child's behavior is indeed inappropriate, and the daycare isn't managing it. The parent's approach is a response to a lack of support from the daycare. However, the method of teaching self-defense physically might not be the best solution for a child her age.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent might be in the wrong because they're encouraging physical confrontation instead of teaching non-violent ways to handle the situation. The spouse's approach of focusing on telling adults and avoiding violence is more aligned with developmental needs for a 4-year-old. The daycare's role should be emphasized more, perhaps through more communication or intervention strategies.\n"
