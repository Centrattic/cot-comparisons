Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her violently. The parent's spouse thinks it's better to just tell the teachers and not use violence. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other kid is 4 as well, but his behavior is concerning. He's hugging and kissing her in a way that's making the daughter uncomfortable, even after she tries to stop him. The teachers aren't effective, so the parent is trying to teach the daughter to defend herself.\n\nAt 4 years old, a child is still learning social boundaries and how to handle situations. The parent is teaching her that it's okay to push away if someone is being violent, which is a form of self-defense. But the spouse argues against using any form of violence, even if it's defensive. \n\nThe key points here are the child's safety and understanding. The parent is trying to empower the daughter to protect herself when others won't help. However, there's a risk that teaching a young child to use force might escalate the situation or lead to misunderstandings. On the other hand, the parent is emphasizing \"legit force,\" not aggression, specifically in cases of unwanted contact.\n\nI should also consider child development. A 4-year-old might not fully grasp the difference between defensive actions and aggressive ones. The parent is trying to teach her to recognize when it's okay to protect herself, which is a good lesson. But the spouse's concern is valid too\u2014relying on teachers and adults is another layer of protection.\n\nBut since the teachers aren't effective, the parent is left with teaching the child to handle it themselves. It's a tricky balance. I think the parent's intention is to protect the child, so they might not be in the wrong. However, maybe there are other non-violent strategies they could explore first, like teaching the child to say \"no\" more firmly or using body language to avoid the hugs. But given the situation, the parent's approach is understandable. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent's advice is about self-defense in a situation where the child is being physically forced. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, because they're trying to protect their child from harm when other avenues aren't working.\n"
