Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The situation involves a child who's being hugged/kissed in a way that's uncomfortable, even after she tells the other kid to stop. The parents are in a disagreement about whether it's okay to use some force to get away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is very young, and their understanding of social interactions is still developing. The author is trying to teach their daughter about personal boundaries and self-defense. The other kid's actions are aggressive and not respecting her wishes, which could be considered a form of bullying or inappropriate behavior, especially since the daycare staff isn't effective in stopping it.\n\nThe author's advice is to use \"legit force\" to push back if the other kid is being violent. The key here is whether the force is necessary and proportionate. The author emphasizes that it's only in cases where the other child is being violent, not to hurt them, but to stop the unwanted contact. They also mention that the daughter is old enough to understand the difference between appropriate and inappropriate force. \n\nOn the other hand, the spouse is concerned that teaching a child to use violence at all might lead to more aggressive behavior. However, the author isn't advocating for general violence but specific, defensive actions in a situation where the child is being harmed. \n\nFrom a child safety perspective, teaching a child to protect themselves is important. If the daycare isn't handling it and the child is in a vulnerable position, giving her tools to defend herself could be seen as necessary. However, there's also the aspect of teaching non-violent conflict resolution. The author does mention telling an adult afterward, so there's a balance.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a real issue of the child not feeling safe. They're providing a practical solution when the usual methods (telling a teacher) aren't working. The advice is about self-defense in a specific context, not general aggression. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
