Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her violently. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push the other kid if he's being too forceful, even if she might get hurt in the process. The spouse disagrees, thinking she should just tell the teachers.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from multiple angles. The key points are the age of the children, the nature of the interaction (violent hugging and kissing), and the advice given by the parent. \n\nAt 4 years old, kids are learning social boundaries and how to express discomfort. The other child is not respecting the daughter's personal space by hugging too hard and not stopping when she yells. The teachers aren't effective because they don't see it happen. The parent taught the daughter to use force if necessary, which is a form of self-defense. \n\nBut there's a line between teaching self-defense and encouraging violence. The parent argues it's legitimate force in a violent situation. However, with young children, even if the other child is aggressive, teaching a 4-year-old to push back might escalate the conflict. The spouse's point is that non-violent solutions like telling the teachers should be prioritized. \n\nAlso, the daughter's age is a factor. A 4-year-old might not fully understand the nuances of when to use force versus when to seek help. The parent might be trying to empower their child, but there's a risk that the child could misinterpret the advice and use force inappropriately in other situations. \n\nOn the other hand, the other child is not stopping even when asked, so the daughter might feel trapped. Teaching her to assert herself physically could be a way to protect herself. However, the parent's response might set a precedent for aggressive behavior in the child. \n\nI need to consider child development theories. At 4 years old, kids are still learning to communicate their needs and emotions. Encouraging physical responses might not be the best approach. Experts often recommend teaching children to say \"no,\" remove themselves from the situation, and tell an adult. \n\nThe parent's approach might be well-intentioned, but it could lead to the daughter using force when it's not necessary. The spouse's concern is valid because even if the other child is the aggressor, the daughter's response could be seen as violent. There's also the aspect of teaching non-violence as a core value in parenting.\n\nBut the situation is about protecting oneself from unwanted physical contact, which is a valid self-defense scenario. The parent is trying to teach the daughter to protect her own body, which is a positive lesson. However, the method (pushing) might be too physical for a 4-year-old, and there might be better ways to handle it without using force.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intentions are good, teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force might not be the best approach. The spouse's advice to rely on adults and non-violent communication could be more appropriate. So the parent might be in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation where both perspectives have merits.\n"
