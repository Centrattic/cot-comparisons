Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent argues it's legitimate self-defense, while the spouse thinks the kid should just tell a teacher.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and understanding. A 4-year-old might not grasp the concept of reporting to adults effectively. If the teachers aren't addressing the issue when it's reported, maybe the child needs a way to protect herself in the moment. The parent is teaching her to use force only when necessary, like when the other kid is being violent and not stopping. That seems like teaching self-defense, not aggression. \n\nBut then, promoting any kind of violence to a young child could be problematic. Even if it's in self-defense, encouraging a 4-year-old to push back might escalate the situation. Kids that age don't always understand boundaries or consequences. There's also the aspect of non-violent conflict resolution. The spouse's point about reporting is important because it's about seeking help from adults rather than handling it themselves. However, if the teachers aren't effective, the child might feel frustrated or unsafe without a clear alternative.\n\nAnother angle is the child's emotional well-being. If the daughter is feeling terrified that the other kid might push back or hurt her, teaching her to run and tell an adult is good, but if she's in immediate distress, having some form of immediate response might help her feel safer. The parent is emphasizing that it's okay to protect herself when the other child isn't respecting her no, which could be seen as valid. \n\nThere's also the social aspect. Teaching a child to use force might affect her interactions with peers. On the other hand, if the other child is not being monitored properly, the parent's method might be the only way the daughter can defend herself right then. \n\nBut then again, teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force could normalize aggression as a solution. The parent mentions they are generally against violence, so this is a specific case. The key here is the difference between legitimate self-defense and starting violence. The parent is trying to teach a clear boundary: if someone is forcefully hugging and not respecting her wishes, then pushing away is okay. That seems reasonable because the other child is the one initiating the unwanted contact. \n\nHowever, the spouse's concern is valid too. Teaching kids to avoid violence is important for their development. Maybe there's a middle ground, like teaching the daughter to clearly say \"no\" and then if that doesn't work, use a gentle push, but not a violent one. Also, maybe reinforcing the idea to tell an adult immediately after. \n\nIn some parenting approaches, it's about empowering the child to set their own boundaries. The parent is doing that, but with a physical response. The spouse prefers a non-physical response. The answer might depend on cultural or personal parenting beliefs. \n\nIn terms of legal or educational guidelines, many schools have policies about physical interactions between children. The fact that the teachers aren't effective in stopping the behavior is a problem, but the parent's solution might not be the best long-term fix. \n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the parent might not be entirely wrong because they're addressing a real issue of the child feeling unsafe and giving her a tool to protect herself. However, there's a risk in promoting any level of violence, even for self-defense, at that age. The spouse's approach emphasizes non-violence and trusting adults, which is also valid. \n\nI think the parent is in a tough spot because the daycare isn't handling it, and they want to protect their child. But teaching a 4-year-old to push back could lead to more issues. The right answer might be that the parent is partially right but could have considered other methods, like working with the daycare more effectively or teaching non-physical boundary-setting. But since the question is if the parent is in the wrong, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're addressing a specific case of unwanted physical contact and teaching self-defense in a limited context.\n"
