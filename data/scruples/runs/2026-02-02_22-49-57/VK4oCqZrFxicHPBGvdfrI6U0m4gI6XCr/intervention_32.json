Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 4-year-old who's being hugged violently by another kid, and the parent advised their daughter to push the other kid away if the hugs become uncomfortable. The parent and their spouse are arguing about the right approach.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the validity of the parent's advice. The child is experiencing unwanted physical contact from another child, which the teachers aren't effectively addressing. The parent's advice is to use force to defend herself when the other child is being violent. The parent emphasizes that it's about \"legit violence,\" meaning self-defense. They also teach the daughter to run and tell an adult if things escalate.\n\nThe spouse's concern is that using violence is never the solution, and they should rely on teachers instead. But in this case, the teachers aren't seeing the incidents because they're happening in a way that's hard to catch. The daughter has already tried telling the teachers, but it's not working. So the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself in a situation where she's being harmed.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the child and the appropriateness of the advice. At 4 years old, a child might not have the judgment to discern when force is necessary. However, the parent is teaching specific scenarios where the other child is being violent and unresponsive to the child's protests. The parent isn't encouraging general violence but self-defense in a specific context.\n\nThere's a balance between teaching a child to stand up for themselves and avoiding aggression. The parent's approach seems to be about recognizing when someone is being violent and responding in a way that ensures safety. However, there's a risk that a young child might overreact or use excessive force without understanding the consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse's argument is about non-violence and relying on authority figures. The problem is that the teachers aren't effective in this case, so the parent is trying an alternative solution. The advice given seems to be about immediate self-protection, which could be justified if the child is in a situation where she can't get help quickly.\n\nI think the parent is not in the wrong because they are addressing a real problem where the child is being harmed and the current measures aren't working. Teaching the child to protect herself in a specific context isn't promoting violence but teaching self-defense. The spouse's concern is valid about the use of force, but the parent's approach is more about self-preservation in an ongoing abusive situation. The daughter is old enough to understand basic concepts of personal space and what's acceptable, so the parent's advice seems reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
