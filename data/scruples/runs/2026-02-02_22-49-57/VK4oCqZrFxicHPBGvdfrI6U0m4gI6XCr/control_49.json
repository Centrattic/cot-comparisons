Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her in a way she finds uncomfortable. The parent's SO is upset, arguing that the child should just tell the teachers and not use violence. The parent believes that teaching the child to use \"legit force\" in a situation where she's being forced is appropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The other child is 4 years old and engaging in what the parent describes as violent hugs and kisses. The daughter has told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent is teaching self-defense, not initiating aggression, but responding to unwanted physical contact. The argument is that the child has the right to defend herself if she's being hurt or forced.\n\nBut wait, 4-year-olds are very young. The child might not fully understand the concept of using force. Even if the parent is encouraging it, there's a risk that the other child might retaliate, which the daughter herself worried about. The SO is concerned about teaching violence, even if it's in self-defense. The parent, however, thinks the child is old enough to distinguish between appropriate and necessary force.\n\nFrom a child development perspective, 4-year-olds are still learning social skills and how to express boundaries. The parent is trying to teach the daughter to assert her boundaries, which is a good thing. However, physical retaliation might not be the best approach. Instead, maybe there are other ways to handle it, like stepping back, using words more clearly, or finding an adult immediately. \n\nAlso, the role of the daycare teachers is important. The parent says the teachers don't see it happening, so maybe the solution is to find a way to monitor the situation more effectively, not necessarily teach the child to use force. But if the teachers can't stop it, the child needs to know how to protect herself. \n\nIn some contexts, teaching children to defend themselves is seen as important, especially in cases of assault or unwanted touch. However, at such a young age, it's more about teaching non-violent ways to set boundaries. The parent's approach might be seen as giving the child tools to protect herself, but the SO's concern is about normalizing violence, even in self-defense. \n\nThere's a balance here. The parent is not teaching aggression but self-protection. However, the method of pushing back might escalate the situation. The daughter's fear of retaliation is valid. The parent's advice to push back again or run away is practical, but maybe there are better strategies for a 4-year-old. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent's intention was to protect their child, which is a good motive. The SO's perspective is also valid, emphasizing non-violence and relying on adults. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. In some cultures, teaching self-defense is encouraged, while others prioritize non-violent solutions. \n\nLegally, even for a child, using force to prevent harm is generally justified if it's necessary and proportionate. But in a daycare setting, the responsibility is on the staff to manage such situations. However, since the staff isn't effective, the parent is trying to empower the child. \n\nSo, the parent isn't entirely in the wrong, but there could be a better approach. The key points are the child's safety and teaching appropriate boundaries. The parent's advice is well-intentioned but might not be the best method for a 4-year-old. Perhaps teaching the child to walk away, seek help immediately, or use clear verbal cues. The parent's answer is B (not in the wrong) because they're trying to protect their child, but the SO's concern is also valid. The best answer is B.\n"
