Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who is hugging and kissing her too roughly and not stopping even when she yells. The parent's spouse disagrees, thinking she should only tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other kid is being aggressive and not respecting the daughter's boundaries. The daughter has already told the teachers, but it's not working. The parent is advising her to use force as a last resort if the other kid won't stop. The parent is emphasizing using just enough force to stop the violence, not more. The daughter is aware of the difference between justified force and violence.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and safety. The child is being subjected to unwanted physical contact, which is a form of violence. Teaching a child to defend herself in such a scenario is about protecting her physical and emotional well-being. At 4 years old, she's old enough to understand boundaries and basic self-defense. The parent is teaching her to assert her space when others don't listen.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that at that age, children should be taught to rely on adults and not use any form of violence. But in this case, the violence from the other child is ongoing and not being addressed properly. The parent's advice is a practical response to a situation where the system (teachers) is failing. The parent is not encouraging random aggression but specific, necessary actions to stop harm.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that they are not promoting general violence in raising their daughter. So it's a targeted response to a specific threat. The daughter's fear of retaliation is addressed by the parent, telling her to push back or run and tell an adult. That shows the parent is considering safety and possible consequences.\n\nIn summary, the parent is trying to protect their child from ongoing unwanted physical contact by teaching her to defend herself when adults aren't effective. The spouse's concern about avoiding violence is valid, but the context here is about self-defense in a situation where the child's safety is compromised. The parent's approach seems reasonable given the circumstances, so the answer is B.\n"
