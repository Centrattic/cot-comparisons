Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly. The parent and their spouse had an argument about it. The spouse thinks the kid should go to teachers, not use violence. The parent argues that it's about using \"legit force\" when someone is being violent and persistent even after being told to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The other child's actions are described as violent hugging and kissing that the daughter doesn't always want. The daughter already told the teachers, but they don't see it happening, and the behavior continues. The parent's advice is to push back if the kid doesn't stop. They also mention teaching the daughter to run and tell an adult if the other kid retaliates.\n\nAt 4 years old, the child is very young. Teaching a child to defend themselves physically might be seen as promoting violence, but the parent is emphasizing a response to violence. However, even if it's in self-defense, the child's age might mean they don't fully understand the difference between appropriate force and aggression. The spouse is concerned about teaching violence, which is a valid point. But the parent is trying to empower the daughter to protect herself when others won't intervene.\n\nI should consider child development perspectives. At this age, kids are learning social boundaries, but teaching a child to push someone might escalate the situation. The parent might not be wrong in wanting to protect their child, but they might be underestimating the child's ability to discern when to use force. Also, the daycare's role is to handle such situations, so the parent's advice could be seen as bypassing the system that's supposed to protect the child.\n\nOn the other hand, if the daycare isn't effective, the parent is trying to find a solution. The key is whether pushing is an appropriate response. Some might argue that any physical response is too much for a 4-year-old, as it could lead to more aggression. Others might agree that teaching a child to stand up for themselves in a controlled way is necessary when other methods fail.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. The parent's intention is protective, but the method might not be age-appropriate. The spouse's concern is valid because teaching physical confrontation could normalize violence. However, the parent is trying to address a specific, harmful situation. The answer depends on whether teaching a child to push someone is considered acceptable self-defense at that age. Since the child is so young, encouraging physical resistance might not be the best approach, even if it's in self-defense. The correct approach might be reinforcing non-physical responses, like removing herself and getting an adult immediately, rather than engaging physically. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for advising physical action when alternatives exist, even if the intent is good.\n"
