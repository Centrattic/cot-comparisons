Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they were wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away a classmate who's hugging her too hard or kissing her without consent. The daughter already tried telling the teachers, but it didn't stop. The parent's rationale is that if someone is harming their child and not stopping when told, it's okay to push back. The spouse disagrees, thinking the child should only tell the adults instead of using violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and maturity of the child. At 4 years old, kids are still learning how to handle social situations and boundaries. The parent is concerned about their daughter's safety and comfort, so encouraging her to protect herself might be seen as a natural instinct. However, teaching a young child to use physical force could have unintended consequences, like escalating the situation or leading the child to act out in other contexts without understanding the nuances.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse's perspective is about reinforcing non-violence and relying on adults to mediate. The daycare's role is crucial here; if the teachers haven't addressed the behavior, maybe there's a need for more consistent intervention or communication. The parent's advice might be seen as necessary self-defense in a specific context, but it's also possible that other non-physical solutions could be taught, like verbal assertiveness or walking away.\n\nI should also consider child development theories. Experts often recommend teaching children to use their words first, then seek help if that doesn't work. Introducing physical responses might be too advanced for a 4-year-old's judgment, especially since they might not discern when force is appropriate. The parent's instruction could be well-intentioned but might not align with recommended strategies for this age group.\n\nMoreover, the other child's behavior\u2014forceful hugs and kisses\u2014might be a sign of developmental issues or poor social skills that the daycare should address. The parent's solution bypasses the system that's supposed to handle such issues, which could mean the problem isn't resolved long-term. The spouse's concern about normalizing violence is valid, as even \"legitimate\" force can become a learned behavior in other situations.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intent is to protect their child, the method might not be age-appropriate or aligned with educational approaches for young children. The spouse's advice to rely on adults and non-violent solutions might be more suitable here. However, there's a balance between teaching self-advocacy and avoiding violence. The parent isn't entirely wrong because the child needs to feel empowered to set boundaries, but the approach should focus on non-physical strategies first. So, the answer might lean towards A (the parent is in the wrong) because the solution involves physical confrontation for a 4-year-old, which could be considered too aggressive given their developmental stage.\n"
