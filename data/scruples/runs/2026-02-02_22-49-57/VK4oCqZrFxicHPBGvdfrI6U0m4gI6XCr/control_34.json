Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's being overly forceful in hugs and kisses. The parent's reasoning is that the child deserves to defend herself when someone is hurting her and not stopping when told.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and understanding. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to express their discomfort. The parent is trying to empower their daughter to set personal space, which is important. But there's a concern about teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force. Even if it's to push back, there's a risk of escalation or injury, especially with another child of the same age.\n\nThe parent argues that they're not promoting violence but legitimate self-defense in a situation where the other child isn't respecting boundaries. However, the other parent (the SO) is worried about encouraging violence. The daycare teachers are already involved, but they haven't handled it effectively. The parent's alternative advice is to run away and tell an adult, which the parent dismisses as not practical because the teachers aren't seeing it happen.\n\nI should also think about the child's ability to understand the difference between necessary force and violence. At 4, their judgment might not be mature enough. If the child pushes back and the other kid retaliates, it could lead to more severe conflicts. The parent's advice might lead to a cycle of physical confrontation rather than teaching non-violent resolution methods.\n\nAlso, in many educational settings, especially daycare, the approach is usually to teach children to communicate their feelings and seek help from adults. Encouraging a child to use physical force could conflict with these established methods. It might also complicate the situation by making the child seem aggressive if the other parent reports it.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is valid in wanting their child to feel empowered to protect herself. The other child's behavior is indeed crossing boundaries, and the daycare's failure to address it is a problem. The parent might be trying to fill the gap left by the daycare's ineffective response.\n\nIn terms of child development, it's crucial to balance self-advocacy with conflict resolution. While the parent's intentions are good, the method might not be appropriate for a 4-year-old. The line between self-defense and violence can be blurry for young children, and teaching physical responses might not be the best approach. Instead, reinforcing communication and seeking adult help might be more developmentally appropriate.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the parent might be in the wrong for advising physical action. The appropriate approach might be to continue working with the daycare to address the issue, perhaps involving the other child's parents if necessary, and teaching the daughter to express her discomfort through words or to seek help immediately.\n"
