Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nThe situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged and kissed forcefully by another child at daycare. The parent encouraged the daughter to push the kid away if she's uncomfortable, even saying it's okay to push back if the other child reacts violently. The spouse disagrees, thinking the daughter should just tell the teachers and not use any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The other child is being aggressive, which is a problem. The parent is trying to teach their daughter self-defense in a situation where she's being forced into unwanted physical contact. That seems reasonable because the child is too young to handle it on her own, and the teachers aren't stopping it effectively.\n\nBut then there's the spouse's argument that using any form of violence isn't acceptable. However, the parent isn't advocating for uncontrolled violence; they're suggesting a defensive action to stop harm. The key here is the difference between using force to defend oneself versus initiating violence. The parent is teaching their child to recognize when she's being hurt and to take immediate action to protect herself, which is a form of self-defense.\n\nAlso, the child is already scared that the other kid might retaliate. The parent's advice includes running away and telling an adult, which adds layers of safety. It's not just about pushing back, but also about seeking help. \n\nOn the other hand, the daycare teachers aren't effectively addressing the issue despite the child reporting it. In such cases, the parent might feel that their own intervention is necessary. However, there's a risk in teaching a child to use physical force, even if it's defensive. It could escalate the situation or teach the child that violence is an acceptable response. But given the context\u2014unwanted physical contact that teachers aren't stopping\u2014the parent's advice might be justified as a last resort.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid too. Encouraging a 4-year-old to use physical force could lead to unintended consequences, like the child using it inappropriately or the other child's parents reacting negatively. But the parent is very clear about the specific circumstances: when the child is being hurt and the other won't stop. It's a targeted response to a specific problem, not general violence.\n\nIn terms of child development, at 4 years old, children can understand the difference between right and wrong actions, especially when given clear guidance. The parent is teaching the child to set boundaries, which is an important life skill. The spouse might be worried about the child becoming aggressive, but the parent is emphasizing the context of self-defense.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the parent's approach seems to be a reasonable way to protect the child in a situation where other methods (telling the teachers) haven't worked. The answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're teaching self-defense in a specific, harmful context rather than promoting violence for its own sake.\n"
