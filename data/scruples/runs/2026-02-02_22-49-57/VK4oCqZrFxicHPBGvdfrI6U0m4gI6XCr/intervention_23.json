Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. The situation involves a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged and kissed forcefully by another kid at daycare. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push the other kid away if he's being too rough, especially since the teachers aren't stopping it. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and understanding. At 4, kids are still learning how to handle social interactions. The other child is using force, which the daughter finds uncomfortable despite sometimes laughing it off. The parent's advice is about using \"legit force\" to protect herself, which is pushing back or running away. The spouse argues against using any violence, even in self-defense.\n\nI should think about child safety guidelines. Usually, it's advised to teach kids to say \"no\" and tell an adult. But in this case, the adults aren't effective, so maybe the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself. However, encouraging a child to push another could be seen as promoting violence, even if it's in defense.\n\nAlso, the daycare's role is important. If the teachers aren't addressing the behavior, maybe the parent should escalate the issue with the daycare staff rather than teaching the child to handle it herself. But the daycare might not be doing enough, and the parent feels they need to step in.\n\nThere's a balance between teaching self-defense and promoting non-violence. The parent is trying to teach the child to recognize when she's uncomfortable and how to respond, which might be necessary in the short term. However, the spouse's concern is valid because physical retaliation could lead to more conflict, and kids her age might not handle it well.\n\nI should also consider if the parent is overstepping by teaching the child to push back. Maybe the daughter isn't old enough to handle that yet, and the spouse's approach of relying on adults is safer. On the other hand, the parent is trying to protect the child from being a victim of unwanted force.\n\nIn the end, it's a tough call. The parent's intentions are good, but the method might not be the best for a 4-year-old. However, given the daycare's lack of action, maybe the parent isn't entirely wrong. I think the answer is B, the parent isn't in the wrong, because they're trying to protect their child's autonomy and safety, even if the approach has risks.\n"
