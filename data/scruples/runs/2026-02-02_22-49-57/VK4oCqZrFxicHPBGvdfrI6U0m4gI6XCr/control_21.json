Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who is hugging her too roughly and even kissing her. The parent's reasoning is that the other child is using force and not stopping when the daughter tells him to, so using some force in self-defense is okay. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to just tell the teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is very young, and their understanding of boundaries and conflict resolution is still developing. The parent is teaching the daughter to use force as a response to unwanted physical contact. While the situation is troubling\u2014another child is being aggressive and not respecting her space\u2014it's important to think about how to handle it appropriately for a preschooler.\n\nThe parent argues that they're not encouraging violence, just \"legit force\" in a specific context. However, teaching a 4-year-old to push someone back might escalate the situation. At that age, children often don't have the emotional control to de-escalate a confrontation once physical force is involved. If the other child pushes back, the daughter might get hurt more, or the conflict could get worse. The parent mentions that the daughter is \"clever\" enough to understand the difference, but even smart kids can misinterpret instructions or act impulsively.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is addressing a real issue: the daughter is being physically uncomfortable with another child's behavior. The teachers aren't effectively stopping it, so the parent is trying to empower the daughter to protect herself. But is that the right approach? In child development, teaching children to use physical force as a solution might not be the best method. It could lead to a cycle of aggression. Instead, teaching non-violent methods like clearly stating boundaries, walking away, or seeking help from adults might be more effective and safer in the long run.\n\nThe spouse's point about not using violence at all is valid because it's important to model non-violent conflict resolution. Even if the other child is aggressive, responding with force might not be the best lesson for a young child. The daughter is already trying to tell the teachers, but they aren't seeing it. The parent could explore other avenues, like speaking to the daycare director about the issue, or maybe even discussing it with the other child's parents if appropriate. \n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. In some places, parents might have a legal obligation to report situations where a child is being harmed, even if it's another child. However, this is more about the daycare's responsibility. The parent's role is more about teaching appropriate behavior. \n\nAlso, consider the child's emotional well-being. Teaching her that she can push back might give her a sense of control, but if the other child retaliates, it could cause anxiety or fear. The daughter already mentioned being worried about the other child pushing back. The parent's response to push back and run away might not be practical for a 4-year-old in a daycare setting. They might not be able to run away safely or find an adult quickly.\n\nIn terms of developmental psychology, children learn best through modeling. If a parent teaches a child to use force, they might model that behavior in other contexts. It's important to teach self-advocacy without promoting aggression. The daughter is already trying to communicate her discomfort, so reinforcing that communication is key. Maybe the parent could work with the daycare to ensure that the teachers are more vigilant or that the other child is supervised during interactions with the daughter.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is to protect the daughter, the method of teaching her to use physical force might not be the best approach. It's possible the parent is well-meaning but not considering the potential escalation and the long-term implications of encouraging physical responses. The spouse's advice to rely on adult intervention instead might be more in line with child development best practices. Therefore, the parent could be in the wrong for endorsing the use of force in this situation, even if the motive is to protect the child.\n"
