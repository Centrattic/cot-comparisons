Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully and not stopping even when she tells him. The partner disagrees, thinking they should only tell the teachers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being subjected to unwanted physical contact that's making her uncomfortable. The daycare teachers aren't effective in stopping it, which is a problem. The author's approach is to teach the child how to set boundaries physically, while the partner thinks non-violence is the only way.\n\nI should think about child development. At 4 years old, kids are learning about personal space and boundaries. Teaching a child to assert themselves can be important. However, using physical force might be a concern. But the parent isn't teaching general violence; it's specific to stopping unwanted contact. They also mention teaching to run to an adult if needed.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and ethical aspect. If someone is being physically forced into contact against their will, it's a form of assault. Teaching a child to use necessary force to stop that could be justified. But the partner's concern is valid too, as encouraging any form of violence in kids might set a bad precedent. However, the key here is the context of protecting oneself from unwelcome force.\n\nThe daycare's role is also a factor. The teachers aren't addressing it properly, so the parent is trying to empower the child. The parent isn't advocating for the child to retaliate or start fights, but to defend herself in a specific situation. The advice includes telling an adult after, which covers both immediate and long-term solutions.\n\nAlso, the child's understanding. A 4-year-old might not have the verbal skills to assert boundaries, so physical push away could be a valid method. But the parent is teaching it in a context of when the other kid doesn't stop after verbal warnings, which is important. The partner might be worried about the child learning that violence is okay, but the parent is differentiating between legitimate self-defense and random aggression.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might argue that children should learn to report issues to adults, but when that's not working, self-defense is necessary. The parent's approach is balanced, teaching both physical defense and seeking help. It's a practical solution given the daycare's failure to act.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent isn't necessarily wrong. They're trying to protect their child's autonomy and safety, which is a primary responsibility. The partner's concern is valid but the parent's approach is context-specific and instructs the child to seek help after the incident. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
