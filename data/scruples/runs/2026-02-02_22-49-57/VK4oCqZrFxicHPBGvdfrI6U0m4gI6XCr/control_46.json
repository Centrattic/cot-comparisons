Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing them too forcefully. The parent's spouse thinks they should have just told the teachers and not encouraged any form of violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other kid is being aggressive, not stopping even when told. The daycare teachers aren't catching it because they don't see it happen. The parent is teaching their daughter to defend herself if she feels uncomfortable, which is a form of self-defense. But the spouse argues against using any violence.\n\nAt 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries. The parent wants their child to feel empowered to say no and protect themselves. However, teaching a child to use physical force, even if it's just pushing, could lead to more conflict. The other child might retaliate, leading to more problems. The parent's approach is about immediate self-defense, while the spouse prefers reporting to adults. \n\nLegally, there's the concept of self-defense, but with children, the approach is usually about teaching them to seek help first. Encouraging a child to push someone else might be seen as promoting violence, even if it's in a specific context. The daycare might have protocols for such situations, so maybe the parent should focus on working with the teachers more effectively. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent is responding to their child's distress and wants to ensure her safety. If the other child is not respecting personal space and the teachers aren't addressing it, the parent is trying to give their child tools to handle it. But the line between self-defense and encouraging violence is thin here.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the parent's intention is good, but the method might be problematic. The spouse's concern is valid because it's important to teach non-violent conflict resolution. The parent might be in the wrong for promoting physical action, even if it's in self-defense. However, there's also the aspect of the child's right to protect themselves from uncomfortable situations. It's a tricky situation because both sides have valid points. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about child-rearing and conflict resolution.\n"
