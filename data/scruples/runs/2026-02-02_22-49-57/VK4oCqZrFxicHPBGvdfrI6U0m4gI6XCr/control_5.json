Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The other child is hugging the daughter too hard and even kissing her, which the daughter finds uncomfortable. The daughter has told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent advises her to push back if the other kid won't stop, even suggesting using force again if the other child reacts.\n\nThe parent argues that it's legitimate force to stop unwanted physical contact, while the spouse thinks it's better to rely on teachers and avoid violence entirely. The daughter is only 4, so her ability to assess and respond to such situations is a factor.\n\nIn terms of child safety, teaching a child to protect themselves from uncomfortable touch is important. However, teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force might escalate the situation or lead to unintended consequences. The parent might be overstepping by encouraging physical retaliation, even if it's in self-defense. Also, the daycare's role here is crucial. The parent should ensure that the daycare is adequately addressing the issue. \n\nBut the parent is trying to empower their child to assert her boundaries, which is a good thing. However, the method of teaching force might not be age-appropriate. Maybe there are other ways to teach the child to assert herself without resorting to physical pushback. The spouse is right in emphasizing non-violence, but the parent's concern about the child's safety is valid too.\n\nLegally and ethically, the parent might not be in the wrong for protecting their child's autonomy, but the approach might be questionable given the age. The daycare's responsibility is also a point to consider. The parent should have discussed this with the daycare staff more thoroughly before advising the child to push back. \n\nSo, balancing both sides, the parent's intention is good, but the method might not be the best. The answer could lean towards A (the parent is in the wrong) because encouraging a child to use force might not be the safest approach. However, the alternative is that the parent is just teaching self-defense. It's a bit of a tight call. But considering the child's age and the potential for escalation, the parent might be in the right for teaching self-defense, but the spouse's point about non-violence is also valid. Hmm, I'm a bit torn here. Maybe the parent isn't in the wrong but should have considered other methods.\n"
