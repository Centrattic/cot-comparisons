Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The question is about whether it's appropriate to encourage a 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and not taking \"no\" when she asks to stop. The parent is telling their daughter it's okay to push him away if he's being too forceful and not listening. The spouse disagrees and thinks they should teach non-violence and report it to teachers instead. The parent argues that the daughter needs to learn to defend herself when someone is being violent.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, children are still developing social skills and impulse control. Teaching a child to push back might be seen as encouraging aggression, but the context here is that the other child is being overly forceful and not respecting boundaries. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself when someone is being harmful. On the other hand, the spouse is concerned about teaching violence, even if it's in self-defense. \n\nAnother angle is the responsibility of the daycare to handle such situations. The parent mentions that the teachers aren't seeing it happen and the other kid isn't stopping even when told. So maybe the daycare isn't doing enough, and the parent is stepping in because they feel the situation isn't being managed properly. \n\nAlso, the parent is clear that they aren't teaching the child to use violence in general, just to push away in cases of being forced. They mention the child is smart enough to understand the difference. It's about setting boundaries and self-protection. But there's a risk that a 4-year-old might misinterpret the advice or escalate the situation. However, the parent's approach could be seen as realistic, acknowledging that sometimes people don't stop when told, so the child needs a way to defend herself. \n\nLegal or ethical perspectives: In many child-rearing practices, there's a balance between teaching non-violence and self-defense. The parent's advice is specific to a situation where the other child is being violent and not respecting consent. Teaching a child to protect themselves in that context might be justified. However, depending on cultural or personal beliefs, some might argue that any form of physical retaliation should be avoided, even if it's in response to aggression. \n\nThe key points here are the child's age, the nature of the other child's behavior (violent and not respecting boundaries), and the parent's intention to teach self-defense versus the spouse's concern about promoting violence. The daycare's failure to address the issue is also a factor. \n\nIn conclusion, I think the parent is not in the wrong because they're teaching their daughter to protect herself from unwelcome physical contact, especially when the daycare isn't intervening effectively. The advice is specific to a situation of coercion and lack of respect for personal space, which is a legitimate concern. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
