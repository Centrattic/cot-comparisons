Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent argues that it's about self-defense when the other child won't stop despite the daughter's protests. The spouse disagrees, saying violence should never be taught.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The child is in daycare and the other kid is being aggressive. The daughter has already informed the teachers, but the behavior continues. The parent's advice is about defending herself against unwanted physical force. The daughter is old enough to understand the difference between appropriate and inappropriate physical contact, according to the parent.\n\nFrom a child safety perspective, teaching a child to protect herself in situations where she's being physically overpowered might be necessary. However, there's also the aspect of teaching non-violent conflict resolution. The spouse's concern is valid too\u2014encouraging any form of physical response could escalate the situation or lead to misunderstandings. \n\nBut in this case, the parent isn't promoting aggression; it's about self-defense when the child is being forced into unwanted physical contact. The key points are that the other child isn't stopping despite being told, and the parent is empowering their daughter to set boundaries. \n\nI think the parent is acting in their child's best interest by teaching her to protect herself when necessary. It's a balance between safety and conflict resolution, but given the circumstances, the parent's approach seems reasonable. The answer would likely be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
