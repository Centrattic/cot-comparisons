Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a 4-year-old girl being hugged and kissed in a way she finds uncomfortable by another kid, and the parent told her it's okay to push back if the other kid won't stop. The spouse disagrees, thinking she should just tell a teacher. The parent argues that it's about using legitimate force when someone is being violent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is still very young, so their understanding of boundaries and how to handle conflict is developing. The parent is trying to teach her daughter to assert her personal space, which is important for self-defense and setting boundaries. However, there's a concern that encouraging a physical response might lead to more aggression or conflict, especially since the other child is already acting out.\n\nThe daycare teachers are supposed to handle these situations, but they aren't catching it. The parent's approach is pragmatic, recognizing that the system isn't working and that the child needs to protect herself. But the spouse's point is valid too\u2014teaching non-violence is crucial, and relying on adults to intervene is the standard approach in educational settings.\n\nI need to weigh the intent here. The parent isn't advocating for general violence but specific self-defense in a situation where the child is being physically forced. The advice includes options like pushing back or running and telling an adult. It's about immediate safety and empowerment. However, there's a risk that pushing could escalate things, especially with a child who might react negatively. The parent is trying to balance empowerment with safety.\n\nIn terms of child development, it's important to teach children to voice their discomfort and seek help. However, when those methods fail, self-defense strategies might be necessary. The parent is addressing a real problem where the usual methods aren't effective. The spouse's concern is about promoting violence, but the parent is careful to specify that it's only when the other child is being violent.\n\nI think the parent's approach is reasonable given the circumstances. They're not encouraging random aggression but specific actions in response to unwanted physical contact. The key is that the child is learning to protect herself when other methods have failed. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
