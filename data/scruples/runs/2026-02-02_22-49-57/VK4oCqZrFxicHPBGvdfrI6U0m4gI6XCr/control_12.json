Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 4-year-old girl who is being hugged and kissed forcefully by another kid at daycare. The parent advises her to push the other child away if they're being forced, and even to push back or run if the other kid retaliates. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers and avoid violence altogether.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. At 4 years old, kids are still learning how to handle social situations and boundaries. The parent is teaching their daughter to assert her physical boundaries, which is important. The child is clearly uncomfortable with the other kid's actions, and the daycare teachers aren't managing it effectively. So, the parent might be trying to empower their daughter to protect herself.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse is concerned about introducing the idea of using physical force. The parent argues it's \"legit force,\" but even gentle pushing at that age could escalate into something more. The daycare's role is supposed to manage these interactions, so maybe the parent should focus on involving the daycare more, like requesting specific strategies or switching groups if possible. Also, teaching a child to use physical force might not be the best approach for a 4-year-old to resolve conflicts. They might not fully understand consequences or how to de-escalate the situation properly.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and institutional responsibility here. Since the daycare is supposed to monitor the children, the parent might be overstepping by instructing the child to use force. However, if the daycare isn't addressing the issue effectively, the parent has a valid concern about their child's safety and comfort. The key is whether the advice given is appropriate for the child's age and the situation. Pushing back might be a reasonable immediate response for a young child when they're in a physical situation they can't verbally stop, but it's also possible that the daycare isn't providing adequate supervision, which is a separate issue.\n\nI also need to consider child development. At 4, children often don't have the emotional regulation to handle such scenarios without adult intervention. The parent is trying to teach self-defense, but maybe the better approach is to reinforce non-physical strategies, like saying \"no\" louder, moving away, and seeking help immediately. The spouse's point about avoiding violence is valid because it's important to model non-violent conflict resolution, but the parent is also right in acknowledging the child's right to bodily autonomy.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, I think the parent isn't entirely wrong because they're trying to protect their child, but their advice might not be the most age-appropriate or effective. The spouse is right in emphasizing the importance of relying on adults for help. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for not focusing enough on the daycare's role and teaching physical force, which could lead to unintended consequences.\n"
