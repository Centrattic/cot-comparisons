Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged and kissed too forcefully by another kid at daycare. The parent advised her daughter to push the other kid away if she feels uncomfortable, and even to push back or run away if the other child reacts violently. The spouse disagrees, thinking she should rely on teachers instead of using any form of violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and understanding. At 4, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to express their discomfort. The parent is trying to teach her daughter to assert herself, which is important for safety. The other child isn't stopping even after being told, so the parent is showing her daughter a way to protect herself when adults aren't around.\n\nBut then there's the spouse's perspective. He's concerned about encouraging violence, even if it's defensive. The parent clarifies they're not advocating for violence but legitimate self-defense in a specific context. The question is whether teaching a child to push back or run away is appropriate.\n\nI should think about child development guidelines. Experts often suggest that young children should be taught to tell a trusted adult if they're uncomfortable. But in situations where immediate action is needed, especially when adults aren't present, teaching a child to set physical boundaries might be necessary. However, the parent's advice includes pushing back, which could escalate the situation. Maybe the spouse is right to worry about the child learning that physical force is acceptable.\n\nAlso, the daycare teachers aren't effectively addressing the issue. The parent is stepping in because the system isn't working. But is it the parent's job to teach the child to handle it on her own, or should they work with the daycare to resolve it? The parent has already informed the teachers, but they're not seeing the incidents. So maybe the parent is just trying to fill the gap.\n\nAnother angle: the parent is teaching a child to recognize when to use force in self-defense, which is a safety measure. However, the spouse is concerned that the child might misuse this advice. The key is the context\u2014force only when being forced and when there's no other way to stop it. The parent emphasizes that the child should tell an adult after.\n\nIs pushing back considered violence? If the other child is using force, then the girl's action could be seen as self-defense. But teaching a 4-year-old to push back might be too complex. Kids at that age might not distinguish between appropriate self-defense and just playing roughly. The spouse might be right to worry about the child misinterpreting the advice.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent is trying to protect their child from uncomfortable and potentially harmful situations where adults aren't available. The spouse is concerned about the message of using violence. The parent's advice is specific to a scenario where the other child is being violent, so it's a form of self-defense. However, teaching a young child to use physical force might not be the best approach when they're still learning social skills. The daycare's lack of response is a problem, but the parent's solution might not be ideal. So, maybe the parent is in the wrong for encouraging physical action instead of relying on adults, even if their intentions are good. Alternatively, they are right in teaching the child to protect herself when the system fails. It's a tough call. Given the options, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the parent is teaching the child to defend herself in a specific context where the other child is being aggressive. But there's a valid argument either way.\n"
