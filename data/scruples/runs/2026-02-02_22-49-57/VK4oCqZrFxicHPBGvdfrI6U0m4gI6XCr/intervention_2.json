Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a four-year-old girl who's being hugged too forcefully by another kid at daycare, sometimes with kisses. The author told her daughter it's okay to push the other kid away if he won't stop, even using force if necessary. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to tell a teacher instead.\n\nFirst, the key points: The other child's behavior is unwanted and aggressive. The daycare teachers aren't consistently catching it, so the daughter isn't getting help from adults. The author advises her daughter to push back or run and tell an adult if the other kid might retaliate. The question is whether this advice is wrong.\n\nFrom a child safety perspective, teaching a child to defend herself when someone is causing her physical discomfort or violating her personal space could be seen as necessary. At four years old, children start to understand boundaries. The author isn't advocating for unprovoked violence but rather self-defense in a situation where the other child is being forceful and not respecting the daughter's protests.\n\nHowever, the spouse's concern is valid too. Encouraging a child to use physical force might escalate the situation or lead to her being labeled as aggressive. Also, daycare settings often have policies against physical retaliation, preferring adults to handle such issues. But in this case, the teachers aren't effective, so maybe the child needs another strategy.\n\nIt's a balance between teaching self-advocacy and non-violence. The author's advice seems to be about empowering the daughter to protect herself when adults aren't acting. Since the child is already trying to communicate to the teachers but it's not working, the author's approach might be a practical solution. Plus, they emphasize telling an adult if the situation escalates, which is still part of the plan.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to ensure their daughter feels safe and knows how to respond when others aren't respecting her boundaries. The spouse's approach is more about avoiding violence, but the author's method is about self-defense in a specific context. Both have valid points, but the author's actions seem to be in the daughter's best interest given the circumstances.\n"
