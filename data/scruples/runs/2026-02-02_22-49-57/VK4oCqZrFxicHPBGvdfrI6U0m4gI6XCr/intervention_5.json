Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's being too forceful in hugging and kissing her. The situation involves a child who's not respecting boundaries, and the parent is advising the daughter to push back if the other kid is being violent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The child is 4, and the other kid is doing things that make her uncomfortable. The parent's advice is about self-defense in a situation where the other child isn't stopping even when told. The parent also emphasizes using \"legit violence\" only when necessary and teaching the child to run away and tell an adult if needed.\n\nThe spouse is upset because they think the child shouldn't use violence at all. But the parent argues that it's about using force to protect against unwanted physical contact. The key here is whether the parent's advice is appropriate for a 4-year-old. At that age, children are still learning boundaries and how to handle social situations. Teaching a child to defend themselves might be necessary in some cases, but there's also the risk of escalating the situation or teaching aggressive behavior.\n\nHowever, the parent isn't encouraging random violence; they're saying it's okay to push away when someone is being violent and not respecting the child's wishes. The parent also includes the option to run and tell an adult, which is a good safety measure. The spouse's concern might be valid, but in a situation where the daycare isn't addressing the issue, the parent is trying to empower their child to protect herself.\n\nI need to consider child development and parenting strategies. Most experts would say that for young children, teaching them to assert their boundaries without physical retaliation is ideal. But when the child is being harmed, some level of self-defense might be necessary. The parent's approach seems to balance both: using force only when necessary and then seeking help. It's a gray area, but given the context, the parent's advice might be justified as a way to protect their daughter until the daycare can properly address the issue.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I should make sure there's no aspect I'm missing, like the potential for the child developing aggressive behavior or the daycare's responsibility. However, since the daycare isn't handling it effectively, the parent's actions are a reasonable attempt to ensure their child's safety.\n"
