Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is dealing with their 4-year-old daughter who's being uncomfortably hugged and kissed by another child. The teacher isn't effective in stopping it, so the parent advises their daughter to push back if the other kid won't stop. The spouse thinks this encourages violence, but the parent argues it's about using legitimate force when there's unwanted contact.\n\nFirst, the age of the child is important. At 4, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The parent's advice is specific to a situation where the other child is being forceful and not respecting the daughter's protests. The parent isn't advocating general violence but teaching self-defense in a specific context. The daughter is already reporting to teachers, but that's not working. So the parent is trying to empower her to protect herself in the immediate moment.\n\nThe spouse's concern is about using any form of violence. However, the parent's instructions are about proportionate response\u2014pushing away, then pushing back if necessary, or running to an adult. This seems reasonable for a child's safety. Teaching a child to recognize when they are in a bad situation and how to respond could prevent further harm. Also, the parent emphasizes telling adults, so it's not just about immediate action but also reporting.\n\nThe key is whether the parent's advice is appropriate for the situation. Given that the other child isn't respecting the daughter's boundaries and the teachers aren't effective, the parent is trying to protect their child. The advice is specific and not about general aggression. So, the parent isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
