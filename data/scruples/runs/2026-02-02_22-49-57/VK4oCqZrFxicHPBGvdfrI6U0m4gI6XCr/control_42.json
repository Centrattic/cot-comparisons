Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. The situation involves a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged and kissed forcefully by another kid at daycare. The parent told her it's okay to push the other kid away if she's uncomfortable, and to push back or run away if necessary. The spouse disagrees, thinking they should just report it instead of using violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to defend herself when she's being uncomfortable. The other kid isn't respecting boundaries, even after being told by adults. So the parent's approach is about self-defense in a situation where the child is being physically uncomfortable.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of teaching violence. The parent says they aren't encouraging random violence but legitimate self-defense. However, with a 4-year-old, the ability to discern when force is appropriate might be limited. The child might not understand the difference between pushing away to stop unwanted contact and using force in another context. Also, the daycare teachers aren't effectively addressing the issue, so maybe there's a need to escalate that problem rather than just teaching the child to handle it on her own.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to empower their daughter to protect herself, which is a valid concern. If the other child is not respecting her no, even after adults intervene, then the daughter needs tools to protect herself until the adults can address it properly. The parent's advice includes telling an adult if things escalate, which is part of the solution.\n\nBut maybe the parent is overstepping by teaching a 4-year-old to push back physically. At that age, children might not have the emotional control to use such tactics appropriately, and it could lead to more conflict or even escalate into something more serious. The spouse's concern about non-violence is also valid because instilling the idea that violence is acceptable, even in self-defense, might conflict with the values they want to teach.\n\nAnother angle is the daycare's responsibility. If the teachers aren't seeing the issue, maybe the parent should work with the daycare to get more consistent supervision or address the other child's behavior. Relying on the child to handle it might not be the best approach if the environment isn't safe.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the parent might be in the wrong because teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force, even for self-defense, could be inappropriate. The daughter might not have the judgment to know when to use that force, and it's the adults' responsibility to ensure the environment is safe for her. The spouse's approach of focusing on reporting and non-violent solutions might be more suitable for a young child.\n"
