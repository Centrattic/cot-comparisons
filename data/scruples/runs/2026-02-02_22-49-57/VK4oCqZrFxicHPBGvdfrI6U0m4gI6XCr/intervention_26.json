Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a 4-year-old being hugged and kissed too roughly by another child, despite telling the teachers. The parent told their daughter it's okay to push back if the other kid won't stop, even suggesting to push again or run away if the other child retaliates. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's always better to tell the teachers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to communicate. The parent is addressing their daughter's immediate physical safety. The other child is using force, not stopping when told, which could be a form of coercion. The parent's approach seems to emphasize self-defense without promoting violence. They specified \"legit force\" in a situation where the other kid is being violent, so the parent is trying to teach their daughter to protect herself.\n\nBut then, the daughter is concerned about retaliation. The parent's advice is to push back again or run and tell an adult. The spouse argues that teaching a child to use any form of violence, even in self-defense, might be harmful. Maybe they're worried about the daughter being labeled as aggressive or escalating the situation. Also, at 4 years old, the child might not understand the difference between defensive push and aggressive behavior. The daycare teachers might not supervise enough, but the parent is trying to equip the child with a tool when adults aren't around.\n\nI should check if there are any guidelines on child-to-child interactions. Typically, parents are advised to teach children to say \"no\" and seek help, not to use physical force. However, the author's situation is a bit different because the child isn't just ignoring the \"no,\" but using force. The parent is trying to teach their daughter a way to handle immediate harm when adults aren't present. But is it appropriate to encourage a 4-year-old to push another child? Even if it's in self-defense, the child may not have the judgment to assess when it's necessary. It could lead to unintended consequences, like the other child becoming more aggressive or the daughter facing punishment for fighting.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is responding to the child's fear and seeking a solution that empowers her. If the daycare isn't effective, the parent might feel they need to provide another option. But the spouse's concern is valid too. Teaching a child to use physical force might conflict with non-violent values. The key is whether the advice was appropriate for a 4-year-old's understanding and the context. Maybe there's a middle ground, like teaching the daughter to remove herself and seek help, instead of directly pushing. However, the parent is trying to address the specific problem the daughter is facing, where verbal cues aren't working. \n\nI think the parent is trying to protect their child's autonomy and safety, which is important. But whether the method is right is debatable. Some might say that at this age, the child should be taught to communicate and seek adult help, avoiding any physical response. Others might agree that in cases of force, a child has the right to self-defense. It's a balance between empowerment and promoting non-violence. Since the parent is not advocating for general violence but specific, necessary force in a harmful situation, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the child's ability to discern and act appropriately is a factor. Perhaps the parent could have added more emphasis on immediately seeking an adult after pushing, rather than just pushing back. Still, the spouse's perspective is valid, but the parent's intention seems protective. So leaning towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
