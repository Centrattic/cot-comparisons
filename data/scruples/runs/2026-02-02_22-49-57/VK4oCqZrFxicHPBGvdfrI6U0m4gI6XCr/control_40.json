Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and kissing her without consent. The parent explains that the child has already tried telling the teachers, but it's not stopping. They argue that it's legitimate self-defense because the other kid is using force and not respecting her wishes.\n\nHmm, the spouse is upset, thinking the parent is encouraging violence. But the parent says they're teaching the child to defend herself against unwanted contact. At 4, kids are still learning social boundaries. The parent wants their daughter to feel empowered to stop the uncomfortable behavior. But is teaching a child to push back the right approach?\n\nOn one hand, promoting self-advocacy is important. Teaching a child to say no and maybe take action if it's not working could be helpful. On the other hand, using physical force, even if it's just pushing, might escalate the situation, especially if the other child is aggressive. The parent also mentions that the daughter is aware of the risks, like the other kid pushing back, and is advised to run away and tell an adult if needed. That part seems to emphasize safety and not encouraging retaliation beyond immediate defense.\n\nBut the spouse's concern is valid too. Introducing violence, even as a last resort, might not be the best lesson for a preschooler. The daycare's role is to manage interactions, and maybe there's a protocol they haven't followed yet. The parent might have bypassed the correct channels by advising the child to take matters into her own hands.\n\nHowever, the situation involves a child who's being forced into physical contact against her will, which is a form of assault. Teaching her to stop it could be seen as necessary self-defense. The key is whether the parent's advice is proportional and appropriate. Pushing back to stop an unwanted hug might be considered reasonable in that context, especially since the child is too young to handle more complex conflict resolution strategies.\n\nI need to balance the importance of teaching consent and self-defense against the risks of encouraging physical confrontation. The parent is not advocating for aggression but for immediate self-protection. Since the teachers aren't effective, the parent is stepping in to protect their child's well-being. That seems justified. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But I should check if there's a better approach, like re-enforcing communication with the daycare or involving other authorities. But given the situation, the parent's action seems to prioritize the child's safety and autonomy.\n"
