Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the parent in the situation is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points here are that the other child is hugging the daughter in a way that's uncomfortable, even violent at times, and the daughter has already tried telling the teachers without success. The parent is advising the daughter to push back if the other kid doesn't stop, and to defend herself if necessary. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to rely on adults and not use violence.\n\nSo, the question is whether this advice is wrong. Let me consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the concept of self-defense applies even to children. If a child is being subjected to unwanted physical contact that's harmful or could reasonably be seen as harmful, they have the right to defend themselves. The parent is teaching the child to recognize when someone is being violent and to take action to protect herself, which is a form of self-defense. However, there are also considerations about how to handle it in a daycare setting. The daycare's responsibility is to manage such situations, so the parent might be right in teaching the child to protect herself immediately, but also should continue to involve the daycare and possibly the parents of the other child.\n\nOn the other hand, teaching a child to use physical force might have consequences. It could escalate the situation, or the other child might retaliate, leading to more conflict. The parent is advocating for immediate self-defense, while the spouse prefers a non-violent approach. The daycare's role is to manage these interactions, so maybe the parent should have emphasized more communication with the daycare rather than physical intervention.\n\nBut the child is only 4, and the other child isn't stopping when told. The daycare isn't effective in stopping the behavior. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself, which is a valid approach. However, it's also important to consider the child's age and whether she can discern when it's appropriate to push back. The parent is clear that it's only in cases of \"legit violence,\" so they're not encouraging random aggression. The key here is the balance between self-defense and the daycare's responsibility.\n\nIn terms of legal standards, self-defense for a child is a bit of a gray area. Some jurisdictions might consider a child's actions in self-defense, but others might have different interpretations. However, ethically, teaching a child to protect herself from harmful actions is generally seen as a good practice. The parent is not advocating for aggression but for defense when other methods have failed.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid because physical intervention can lead to more violence. But in this case, the other child is the aggressor. The parent is responding to a persistent problem that the daycare hasn't resolved. So, the parent is trying to equip the child with tools to protect herself when adults aren't able to do so.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're addressing a real issue where the child is being harmed and the existing measures (teachers, daycare) aren't working. Teaching self-defense in this context can be appropriate. However, it's also important to continue working with the daycare and perhaps involve the other parents if necessary. The answer here would be that the parent is not in the wrong because they're protecting their child from harm, using self-defense principles that are age-appropriate and targeted.\n"
