Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her violently. The other kid is being forceful, even when the daughter yells for him to stop. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push him away and if he pushes back, to push back or run and tell an adult. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to report to teachers and avoid violence.\n\nSo, the parent's reasoning is that the daughter should defend herself against unwanted physical contact, especially since the teachers aren't intervening effectively. The key points here are the age of the child, the nature of the aggression (non-consensual forceful hugs and kisses), and the parent's advice being about using minimal force to stop the harm. The parent is emphasizing self-defense and seeking help if necessary, not escalating to beatings.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse's concern is that teaching a child to use violence, even for self-defense, might set a problematic precedent. However, in this case, the parent is teaching the child to protect themselves when other avenues (telling the teachers) haven't worked. The situation involves a young child being subjected to uncomfortable physical contact, which could be a form of bullying or inappropriate behavior from another child.\n\nLegally and ethically, teaching a child to defend themselves from harm is often seen as prudent, especially when other methods fail. The parent isn't encouraging random aggression but specific, necessary actions to stop ongoing unwanted contact. The child's age is young, but the parent is assessing that the daughter is capable of understanding the difference between necessary self-defense and unprovoked violence.\n\nConsidering all that, it seems the parent is acting in the child's best interest to ensure her safety and comfort. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
