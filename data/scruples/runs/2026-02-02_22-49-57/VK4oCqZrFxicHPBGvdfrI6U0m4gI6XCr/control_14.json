Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully and kissing her against her will. The situation is that the other kid doesn't stop even when she yells, and the teachers aren't effective. The parent's partner thinks they should avoid violence and just tell the teachers, but the parent argues it's about using legit force in self-defense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The other child's behavior\u2014forceful hugs and kisses\u2014could be seen as inappropriate, especially since the daughter is expressing discomfort. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to assert herself, which is a form of self-advocacy. But the parent's SO is concerned about teaching violence, even if it's defensive.\n\nIn terms of developmental stages, 4-year-olds might not have the physical or emotional capacity to defend themselves effectively. The parent's advice to push back or run and tell an adult makes sense in theory, but in practice, a young child might escalate the situation or feel scared if the other child reacts aggressively. Also, teaching a child to use physical force might conflict with non-violent conflict resolution methods that are typically encouraged in early education.\n\nAdditionally, the daycare's role is crucial. While the teachers aren't catching the behavior, maybe there's a need for more structured supervision or intervention strategies. The parent might be right in wanting their child to stand up for herself, but relying on the child to handle it physically could miss opportunities to address the root cause with the daycare and the other child's parents.\n\nThere's also the aspect of setting boundaries. Teaching a child to recognize and communicate discomfort is important, but the parent's approach could be seen as promoting physical confrontation. The ideal approach might be a combination: teaching the child to firmly say \"no,\" remove herself from the situation, and immediately report it to a trusted adult. This avoids teaching violence while empowering the child to take control.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is to protect their daughter from unwanted contact, the method suggested\u2014physical pushing\u2014could be considered too direct for a 4-year-old's context. The partner's concern about non-violence and relying on adults is valid. So, the answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong, hence A. However, there's nuance here. Maybe it's not entirely wrong, but there's room for a better approach. But given the options, A or B. The parent's method might be too aggressive for a 4-year-old's social environment, so A.\n"
