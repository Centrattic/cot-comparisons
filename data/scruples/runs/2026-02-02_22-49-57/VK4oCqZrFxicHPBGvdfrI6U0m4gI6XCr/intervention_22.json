Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard. The parent and spouse had a disagreement about this.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged forcefully by another kid, sometimes even kissed, despite her protests. The parent told her it's okay to push away if the other kid is hurting her and not stopping when she yells. The spouse thinks she should have told the teachers instead of using violence. \n\nThe key here is the age of the child and the nature of the problem. At 4, kids don't have a full grasp of social boundaries or consent. The other child is engaging in behavior that's uncomfortable and possibly inappropriate, not just friendly hugging. The parent is trying to teach their daughter self-defense, which is a valid concern. But using physical force might not be the best approach for a preschooler. They might not understand how to apply appropriate force, and there's a risk of escalating the situation, as the daughter feared.\n\nHowever, the parent is emphasizing \"legit force\" in self-defense scenarios, which is different from general violence. The parent isn't encouraging aggression but a response to being hurt. The spouse is concerned about any use of violence, even in self-defense. \n\nThe daycare teachers aren't managing the situation effectively, so the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself. But at 4 years old, the child might not have the judgment to assess when force is necessary. Also, teaching a child to push back might lead to more physical altercations, which could be problematic in a daycare setting. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent and personal space. The parent is addressing a real issue where the child feels violated, so the parent's intention is to protect their daughter. However, the method might not be the most effective or age-appropriate. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The parent is trying to teach self-protection, which is reasonable. But the approach might be too aggressive for a preschooler. The spouse's point about involving adults (teachers) is also valid since they are responsible for managing such situations in a daycare. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent isn't entirely wrong, but their approach could be improved. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. The parent's intent is protective, but the method may not be suitable for a 4-year-old. The answer might lean towards the parent being right in their intention but wrong in the method. However, given the context, the parent's actions are a reasonable attempt to protect their child when other measures have failed. Thus, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
