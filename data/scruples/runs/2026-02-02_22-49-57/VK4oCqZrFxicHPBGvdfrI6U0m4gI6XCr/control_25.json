Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the parent who encouraged their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter is at daycare, and another boy keeps hugging and kissing her in a way she finds uncomfortable. She's tried telling the teachers, but they don't catch it, and the boy doesn't stop. The parent advises her that if the boy is being violent and won't stop, it's okay to push him away. The spouse disagrees, thinking the parent is promoting violence.\n\nSo, the key points here are about appropriate responses to unwanted physical contact for a young child. The parent is teaching the child to assert herself physically in a specific situation where she's being forced, not to use violence for no reason. The spouse is concerned about encouraging any form of violence, even in self-defense.\n\nI need to consider child development and safety. At 4 years old, children are learning boundaries and how to handle conflicts. Normally, teaching non-violence is important, but sometimes, especially when a child is being harmed or harassed, teaching them to protect themselves might be necessary. However, the line between teaching self-defense and encouraging aggression can be thin here.\n\nThe daycare's role is also important. The daughter already reported it, but the teachers aren't effective. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself when adults aren't present. But maybe the parent should look into other solutions first, like changing daycare arrangements or involving the boy's parents if possible. However, given that the teachers aren't catching the behavior, maybe the parent's hands are tied.\n\nAnother angle: Is a push considered violent? If the boy is using forceful hugs and the daughter is using minimal force to push back, is that a proportionate response? Maybe. But teaching a child to use physical force at such a young age might set a precedent for using violence in other situations, which the spouse is worried about.\n\nAlso, the daughter's fear of retaliation is mentioned. The parent tells her to push back and run away, but does that teach her to escalate the situation? Or is it a way to ensure her safety immediately?\n\nIn terms of parenting styles, the parent is trying to teach self-advocacy and self-protection, while the spouse is concerned about promoting a cycle of violence. Both have valid points. The parent is addressing an immediate threat, while the spouse is thinking about long-term behavior patterns.\n\nI should also consider if there are alternative solutions. For example, teaching the daughter to use words more firmly, to move away, or to seek help more effectively. However, the parent might feel that since the teachers aren't responding, the child needs a way to protect herself in the moment.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, they're teaching the child to stand up for herself in a situation of unwanted contact, which is important. On the other hand, introducing physical force at 4 might not be the best approach. However, the parent is not encouraging random violence but a specific, necessary response to an ongoing problem. The key here is the context: the boy is persistently aggressive, and the child's previous methods aren't working. The parent's advice is about self-defense, not aggression. Therefore, maybe the parent is in the right. But the spouse's concern about violence in general is valid. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the action is seen as self-defense or as initiating violence. If it's the latter, the parent is wrong. But if it's the former, then it's justified. Since the scenario is about stopping an ongoing violation of personal space and comfort, the parent's advice is about stopping an immediate harm. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
