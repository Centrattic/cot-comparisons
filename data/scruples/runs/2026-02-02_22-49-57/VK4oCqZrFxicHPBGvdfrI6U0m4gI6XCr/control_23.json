Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who encouraged their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's being too forceful in hugs and kisses is in the wrong. The parent told their daughter it's okay to push the kid away if he's being violent and not stopping when told. The spouse thinks it's better to tell the teachers and avoid any violence. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being hugged and kissed in a way she finds uncomfortable, even after telling the other kid to stop. The teachers aren't effective in stopping it. The parent is advising self-defense, which is teaching the child to protect herself. But at 4 years old, is pushing someone a violent act? Maybe, but it's a very young child trying to assert her boundaries.\n\nOn one hand, teaching a child to use physical force might be seen as encouraging violence. But on the other hand, the child is being subjected to unwelcome physical contact that's making her uncomfortable. The parent is trying to empower her to set boundaries. However, at 4, children might not fully understand the difference between defending themselves and initiating violence. The spouse's concern is that even minimal force could escalate the situation, leading to more conflict.\n\nAlso, the daycare's responsibility is to manage interactions between children. The parent's approach might be seen as taking matters into their own hands instead of relying on the daycare's disciplinary measures. But if the daycare isn't effective, the parent's frustration is understandable.\n\nIn terms of child development, teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force in such situations could have mixed results. It might help her stand up for herself, but it could also model aggression. However, the parent emphasized that it's only in cases of \"legit violence,\" which is a nuance. But the line between self-defense and aggression can be blurry for a young child.\n\nThe spouse's argument is valid because non-violent solutions like telling a teacher are important. However, the parent is addressing the child's immediate need to feel safe. The key question is whether the parent's advice is appropriate given the child's age and understanding. Since the parent is not teaching general violence but a specific defense in a specific context, it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nI think the answer might be that the parent is partially in the wrong because teaching a young child to use physical force could be problematic, even if the intent is self-defense. The daycare's role should be emphasized more, and perhaps other strategies like role-playing how to say \"no\" or using a gentle push without escalating could be better. But the parent's concern for the child's safety is valid. However, the parent might have overstepped by suggesting pushing, which could be seen as encouraging violence. So maybe answer A (the parent is in the wrong) because it's better to focus on non-violent solutions for a 4-year-old, even if the daycare isn't handling it well.\n"
