Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The situation involves a child who's exhibiting strange behavior, like hugging and kissing her too hard, and the daughter has already told the teachers, but the behavior continues. The author's spouse is upset because they think the daughter should just tell the teachers and not use any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and understanding. A 4-year-old might not fully grasp the concept of non-violent conflict resolution. The other child is being aggressive, and the daughter is feeling hurt or uncomfortable. The author is teaching her to defend herself using \"legit force,\" which they clarify isn't about beating kids up but pushing back or running away if necessary. \n\nThe spouse argues that relying on teachers is better. But the teachers aren't around when the incidents happen, so the daughter can't rely on them to intervene. The author's advice seems to be about self-defense in a situation where the child is experiencing unwanted physical contact. The key here is that the child is being forced into these interactions, and the author is trying to empower her to stop it immediately. \n\nHowever, there's a debate about teaching young kids to use physical force. Some might argue that it's better to teach them to walk away and tell an adult. But in this case, the daughter is already trying to tell the adults, and it's not working. The author's approach might be seen as preparing her to protect herself in the moment, which could be justified given the ongoing nature of the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, encouraging a 4-year-old to push someone could lead to escalation. The spouse is concerned about promoting violence, even if it's defensive. But the author is very clear about the context\u2014using force only when there's clear harm and the other child won't stop. They also mention that they teach the child not to use random violence, so it's about teaching a specific, necessary response to a specific threat.\n\nIn terms of child development, it's important to balance safety and social learning. The child should understand her right to say no to unwanted touch, but also learn how to communicate this without resorting to physical aggression. However, given the situation where the other child doesn't respond to verbal cues and the teachers aren't present, the author's advice might be the most immediate way to stop the behavior. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to protect their daughter from ongoing discomfort and possible harm by giving her practical tools to handle a situation where adults aren't available to help. The spouse's concern is valid, but the author's approach is more about self-defense in a specific context rather than promoting general violence. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
