Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's hugging her too forcefully, even after she yells to stop. The parent argues it's legitimate self-defense, while the spouse thinks she should just tell a teacher. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, the child is being subjected to unwanted physical contact that's making her uncomfortable. The daycare teachers aren't effectively stopping it. The parent's advice is to use physical force as a last resort if the child can't get help from adults. The key here is whether it's appropriate to teach a 4-year-old to use physical force.\n\nOn one hand, teaching a child to defend herself might be seen as empowering her to protect her boundaries. It's about recognizing her right to say no and take action when necessary. On the other hand, some might argue that even at a young age, resolving conflicts through communication and seeking adult help is preferable, and that introducing physical responses could escalate situations or normalize violence.\n\nBut the situation here isn't just a simple disagreement. The other child is being aggressive and not respecting the daughter's limits, even after being told to stop. The parent is emphasizing \"legit force\" as a means of self-defense, not unprovoked aggression. The child is being taught to respond only when the other child is violent and doesn't stop, which is a form of self-protection.\n\nAlso, considering the child's age, the parent is acknowledging her ability to understand the difference between appropriate and inappropriate force. The advice includes alternatives like running away and telling an adult if things escalate, which shows the parent is considering safety and not just promoting violence.\n\nIn many child development contexts, teaching kids to assert their boundaries is encouraged. However, the method of teaching physical resistance at such a young age could be a point of contention. Some experts might prefer non-violent solutions first, but if those aren't working, then self-defense can be a necessary step. The parent is trying to balance safety and respect for the child's autonomy.\n\nSo, the parent's approach seems reasonable given the circumstances. They're not promoting general violence but specific, justified actions to protect against ongoing aggression. The spouse's concern is valid but perhaps more focused on avoiding any form of violence, which might not be the best approach when the child is already in a dangerous situation.\n"
