Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too roughly. The situation is that the other child is being forceful and not stopping even when she asks. The parent told their daughter it's okay to push him away and even suggested pushing back or running and telling an adult if he retaliates. The other parent is upset, thinking it's better to report and not use violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is pretty young, so their ability to understand and handle such situations might be limited. The parent is trying to teach self-defense, but is that appropriate for a 4-year-old? Maybe not. At that age, kids are still learning social skills and boundaries. Teaching them to use physical force, even in self-defense, might lead to more aggressive behavior or conflicts.\n\nAlso, the situation involves a child who might have behavioral issues. The parent mentions the other kid's parents are helicopter parents, but that's not an excuse. The main issue is that the daughter is being forced into uncomfortable physical contact. The teachers aren't effectively addressing it, so the parent steps in. However, the parent's solution is to encourage physical resistance. But maybe the right approach would be to involve the daycare more consistently, maybe escalate the issue, or talk directly to the other child's parents. \n\nAnother angle is the child's understanding of force. The daughter worries the other might retaliate, and the parent advises pushing back. But a 4-year-old might not have the judgment to assess when force is necessary and might use it inappropriately. There's also the risk of escalating the conflict or causing physical harm accidentally.\n\nThe partner's concern is valid\u2014encouraging violence, even in self-defense, might not be the best message. The parent argues it's about using \"legit violence,\" but for a young child, distinguishing between legitimate force and aggression is a complex concept. The daycare's role is crucial here; maybe the parent should work more closely with the teachers to find a solution rather than teaching the child to defend herself physically.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, teaching kids to assert their boundaries is important, but the method matters. Non-violent solutions like teaching the child to say \"no\" firmly, walking away, or reporting the behavior might be more appropriate. Physical intervention could lead to the child being labeled as aggressive or facing disciplinary actions if the situation escalates.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent's approach might be well-intentioned but possibly misguided. The daughter's safety is important, but the method used could have unintended consequences. The correct approach would involve more communication with the daycare and perhaps the other parents, rather than teaching the child to use physical force at such a young age. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for advising physical resistance instead of focusing on non-violent solutions and involving the daycare more effectively.\n"
