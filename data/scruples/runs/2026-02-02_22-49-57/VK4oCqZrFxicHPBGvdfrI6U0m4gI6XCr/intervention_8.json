Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent did the wrong thing by telling their 4-year-old to push another kid who's hugging her too hard. The situation involves a child who's being forceful, even after being told to stop by the child herself. The parent is advising their daughter to use \"legit force\" if needed, like pushing back or running to an adult.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Four years old is very young, so their understanding of personal space and boundaries is still developing. The parent is responding to a situation where the child is being physically uncomfortable, which is a valid concern. The child has already tried telling the other kid to stop, but it's not working. The daycare teachers aren't catching it either, so the parent is stepping in to help her daughter protect herself.\n\nThe parent's advice includes pushing away if the other child is being aggressive. That seems like a reasonable self-defense tactic for a young child. However, the parent also mentions that if the other kid retaliates, the daughter should push back again or run. But wait, the parent says they're not encouraging general violence, just in this specific case where the other child is forcing affection. The parent is teaching the child to recognize when a boundary is being crossed and how to respond.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse is concerned that teaching a child to use violence, even in self-defense, is not the right approach. They might argue that the child should rely on adults more and not escalate physical interactions. There's a valid point here too. At four years old, the child might not have the judgment to assess when force is appropriate, and pushing back could lead to more conflict or injuries.\n\nBut the parent is emphasizing that it's about \"legit violence,\" meaning defending against someone who's being violent. The scenario here is more about unwanted physical contact rather than outright aggression. The line between playful behavior and something inappropriate is blurry at that age. The parent's approach is to empower the child to set boundaries, which is important for her development.\n\nI should also consider if there are other ways to handle it. The daycare teachers aren't responding effectively, so maybe the parent should escalate the issue further with the daycare's management or the other child's parents. However, the parent is trying to protect their own child's well-being in the immediate situation. The advice given is within the context of teaching self-defense and personal safety, which is a common practice in child safety education.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the child's emotional state. Feeling safe is crucial, and the parent is trying to ensure that their daughter can assert herself. However, teaching a four-year-old to push someone might be seen as too aggressive, depending on cultural or personal values. The spouse's concern might stem from a place of wanting to avoid violence in any form, which is understandable.\n\nIn terms of legal or social norms, there's a concept of self-defense that starts from a young age. If a child is forced into physical contact they don't want, being able to push away is a basic form of self-defense. However, the parent should also teach the child to report the incidents to trusted adults as a primary step, using physical action as a last resort when other methods fail.\n\nSo, balancing both perspectives, the parent is trying to teach their child to protect herself in a situation where others aren't responding. The spouse is worried about encouraging violence. The parent's approach is situational and specific, not promoting general aggression. Therefore, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
