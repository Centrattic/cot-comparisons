Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent argues that the other child isn't stopping despite the daughter's protests and that teachers aren't effectively addressing it. They told the daughter to push back if necessary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is only 4, which is very young. The other child is exhibiting behavior that's making her uncomfortable, even violent. The parent's advice is about self-defense in a situation where the other child isn't respecting boundaries. But the parent's partner (SO) disagrees, thinking it's better to rely on teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nSo, what's the right approach? Well, teaching a young child to use physical force to defend themselves might have risks. If the other child is aggressive, the daughter might get hurt if she pushes back, especially since the parent mentioned the daughter was concerned the other kid might push back. Also, at 4, children might not fully understand the concept of appropriate force versus aggression. There's a line between self-defense and escalating a conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to empower their child to set boundaries and protect herself, which is important. The child's safety and emotional well-being are key. However, relying on non-violent methods first, like verbal communication and involving adults, is typically recommended in such scenarios, especially for young children. The parent's advice could be seen as promoting violence, which is a concern, even if it's intended as self-defense.\n\nThe daycare teachers not addressing it effectively is a problem. Maybe there's a need to escalate the issue to daycare administration or consider other measures. The parent's approach might be well-intentioned, but the method of advising a 4-year-old to push another kid might not be the best solution. There's a risk that the child might act impulsively or misinterpret the advice, leading to more harm.\n\nSo, the parent might be in the wrong for encouraging a physical response instead of focusing on non-violent strategies. However, it's a complex situation where the parent is trying to address a real issue. The answer might depend on cultural context or specific parenting philosophies. But in most cases, experts would advise against teaching young children to use physical force unless it's absolutely necessary and properly guided, which might not be feasible for a 4-year-old in daycare.\n"
