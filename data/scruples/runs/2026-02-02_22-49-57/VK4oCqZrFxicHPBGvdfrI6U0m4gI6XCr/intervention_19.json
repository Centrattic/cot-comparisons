Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old to push away another child who's hugging her too roughly. The main issue here is whether it's appropriate to teach a child to use physical force in this situation.\n\nFirst, the context: the other kid is consistently hugging the daughter too hard and even kissing her when she doesn't want it. The daughter has told the teachers, but they don't see it happen, and the behavior continues. The parent is advising the child to push back if the other kid won't stop. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to rely on teachers and avoid violence. \n\nI need to consider the child's age and understanding. At 4 years old, children are learning about personal boundaries and how to express discomfort. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself when the adults aren't able to intervene. However, teaching a child to use physical force, even in self-defense, might have unintended consequences. It could lead to escalation or the child using force inappropriately in other situations. But the parent is being specific: only in cases where the other child is being violent and not respecting her attempts to stop. \n\nThe spouse's concern is valid because non-violent solutions are usually preferable, especially for young children. However, if the child's well-being is at risk and the adults aren't able to address the issue, teaching the child to assert herself might be necessary. The key here is whether the parent's advice is proportionate and appropriate for a 4-year-old. The parent mentions that they are strict about not using violence otherwise, so the instruction is in a specific, justified context. \n\nAlso, the child's ability to distinguish between necessary force and unnecessary aggression is a factor. The parent is teaching self-defense, which in some contexts is considered acceptable. However, there's a risk that the child might not fully grasp the boundaries, leading to potential issues. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might argue that even teaching a child to push someone is promoting violence, while others see it as teaching self-advocacy. The parent's approach seems to be about empowering the child to protect herself when other avenues (telling adults) aren't working. \n\nConsidering all this, the parent's intention is to protect their child and teach her to set boundaries. The method is direct but within a specific scenario. Since the child is being taught to act only when the other child is being violent and not respecting her, it's a form of self-defense. The parent is also emphasizing running away and telling an adult as alternatives, which are non-violent options. \n\nTherefore, the parent's actions don't seem to be in the wrong. They are responding to a real issue that the child is facing and providing tools for her to protect herself when the system isn't working. The spouse's concern is valid, but the parent's action is a reasonable response given the circumstances.\n"
