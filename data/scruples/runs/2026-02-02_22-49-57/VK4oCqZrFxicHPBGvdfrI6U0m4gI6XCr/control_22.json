Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who encouraged their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard is in the wrong. The situation is that the other child is being physically overbearing, and the parents are divided on the best way to handle it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The author's concern is valid because the other child is using force, which could be uncomfortable or even harmful. The daughter has already communicated this to the teachers, but the behavior hasn't stopped. The author's advice is to use physical force as a last resort if the other child won't stop despite the daughter's protests. \n\nThe spouse argues that violence should never be used and that the daughter should go straight to the teachers. The author emphasizes that they're not encouraging general violence but rather self-defense in a specific, repeated situation where the other child is being aggressive. \n\nI should think about child development and safety. At this age, children might not always report incidents correctly, but the daughter is clearly articulating the problem. The teachers aren't effective in stopping the behavior, so the parent is trying to give their child a way to protect herself. However, teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force could set a precedent for using aggression to solve problems, which might not be ideal. \n\nOn the other hand, the situation described is a form of bullying or unwanted physical contact. The other child isn't respecting personal space, and the daughter is being forced into uncomfortable interactions. The parent is trying to empower their child to set boundaries. \n\nI need to weigh the pros and cons. The parent's approach might be appropriate in teaching self-defense in a specific context, but the spouse's concern about normalizing violence is also valid. The key is whether the advice is proportionate. Pushing away is a minimal form of force compared to hitting or other aggressive acts. It's a way to remove oneself from the situation without causing harm. \n\nAlso, the parent is not encouraging the child to retaliate beyond self-defense, as they mention if the other child pushes back, she should run and tell an adult. That seems like a balanced approach. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're addressing a real issue where the school isn't providing enough support. Teaching the child to defend herself in a specific, non-violent way (pushing off) might be reasonable. However, it's important to also reinforce reporting to adults as a primary method. The answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
