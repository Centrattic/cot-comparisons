Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and not stopping when she says so. \n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter is being hugged forcefully by a same-age kid, even when she protests. The parents have talked to the teachers, but it's hard for them to catch it. The parent advised the child to push back if the other kid won't stop, and if the other kid retaliates, to push back or run away and tell an adult.\n\nThe spouse argues that the child should just tell the teachers and avoid violence. The parent says they're not promoting general violence but teaching their daughter to use force in self-defense when someone is harming her.\n\nNow, considering child psychology and social norms. At 4 years old, children are still learning how to interact and set boundaries. Teaching a child to use physical force, even for self-defense, might be seen as escalating the conflict. However, the parent's concern is valid because the other child is not respecting the daughter's boundaries, which could be a form of bullying or inappropriate behavior.\n\nOn one hand, teaching a young child to push back might encourage aggressive behavior, which could lead to more problems. On the other hand, the parent is trying to teach their child to protect themselves when adults aren't able to intervene. There's a balance between teaching self-defense and promoting non-violence.\n\nIn some contexts, teaching children to set boundaries physically is considered necessary, especially if the child is in a situation where they can't get help immediately. However, at 4 years old, the child's ability to assess the situation and use appropriate force might not be mature enough. The parent's advice to push back could be seen as overstepping into teaching violence when the child might be too young to handle it that way.\n\nAlso, the key point is whether the parent's advice is justified given the child's age and the situation. Since the child is already trying to tell adults and it's not working, the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself. However, the spouse's concern is about avoiding a cycle of violence. \n\nLooking at similar parenting advice, many experts suggest teaching children to say \"no\" and seek help, but physical confrontation might not be the best approach for very young children. They might not have the judgment to know when to use force and when to stop. So, the parent might be in the wrong by encouraging physical action instead of reinforcing non-violent solutions, even if the initial action is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the parent is in the wrong).\n"
