Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the parent is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and forcing kisses. The other kid's parents are overbearing, and the teachers aren't doing much. The daughter was worried the other kid might push back, and the parent advised her to push back or run away and tell an adult. The spouse thinks the parent is wrong and that the daughter should just tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At four, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The parent is trying to protect their daughter from uncomfortable and potentially harmful situations. The other child is engaging in behavior that's making the daughter uncomfortable, and the teachers aren't intervening effectively. \n\nThe parent's advice is about using \"legit violence\" as self-defense. But using the term \"violence\" might not be appropriate for a 4-year-old. However, the parent is not encouraging random aggression; they're teaching the child to protect herself in a situation where she's being physically forced into unwanted contact. \n\nThe spouse's concern is valid too. Encouraging a child to use physical force could lead to escalating conflicts or teach that violence is an acceptable response. However, in this case, the child is not starting the conflict but defending herself. The parent is emphasizing that it's okay to set boundaries and protect oneself when verbal cues (telling the other kid to stop) and adult intervention aren't working.\n\nBut is pushing considered violence for a child? Maybe not in the same sense as adult violence. It's a physical response to a physical threat. The key here is teaching the child that her body belongs to her and she can protect it when necessary. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of social learning. If the daughter pushes back, the other child might react negatively, as the daughter mentioned. The parent's advice to push back or run away and tell an adult is about immediate self-defense. But for a 4-year-old, the ability to assess and respond appropriately in such a situation might be limited. They might not have the physical coordination or emotional maturity to handle a confrontation without escalating it.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is addressing a real issue where the daughter is being physically uncomfortable. The teachers aren't intervening, so the child needs to have strategies to protect herself. The parent is not teaching aggression but self-protection. \n\nThe spouse's argument that non-violence is better makes sense in promoting peaceful conflict resolution. But in cases where the child's own safety and comfort are at stake, self-defense could be justified. \n\nSo, the parent is trying to balance teaching their child to stand up for herself without encouraging violence. The line between self-defense and initiating violence is thin, especially with young children. The parent's advice might be appropriate in the context but could have unintended consequences. \n\nIn the end, whether the parent is in the wrong depends on the specific advice given. The parent isn't encouraging random aggression, just a response to unwanted physical contact. The spouse's concern is about the use of physical force, but the parent is addressing a legitimate need for the child to feel safe. So, I think the parent isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
