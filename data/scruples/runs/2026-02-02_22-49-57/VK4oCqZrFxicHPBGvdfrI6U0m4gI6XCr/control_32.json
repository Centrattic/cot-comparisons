Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent's reasoning is that since the kid won't stop even when the daughter tells him, and the teachers aren't catching it, it's okay to use some force to get away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is very young, and their ability to understand and handle such situations might be limited. The parent is trying to protect their child from what sounds like unwanted physical contact, which could be a form of bullying or at least uncomfortable interactions. The parent emphasizes using \"legit force\" only when necessary, like pushing back or running away if there's a threat. However, the spouse is concerned about encouraging violence at all, even in self-defense.\n\nI should think about child development. At 4 years old, kids often don't have the judgment to discern when force is appropriate. Teaching a young child to push someone might escalate the situation because kids that age can misinterpret actions or respond aggressively. Also, the daycare's role is to manage such interactions, so maybe the parent should focus on working with the daycare more before advising the child to take matters into her own hands.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and ethical side. In many places, parents are advised to teach children to tell an adult first. Using physical force, even in self-defense, might not be the best approach for a 4-year-old. The other child's behavior could be due to developmental issues, so there's a need for the daycare to address it properly.\n\nThe parent's intention is good\u2014they want to protect their daughter. However, the method might be problematic because a 4-year-old might not have the emotional regulation to use force appropriately without causing harm. The spouse's concern about escalating the situation or normalizing violence is valid. The daycare's role is crucial here, so maybe the focus should be on ensuring the daycare has strategies to prevent the other child's behavior, rather than teaching the daughter to push back.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of teaching non-violent conflict resolution. The parent might want to model that for their daughter. While it's important to teach self-advocacy, physical pushing might not be the best strategy for such a young child. Maybe teaching her to say \"no\" more firmly, use her voice, or move away could be better options. The daycare might need to involve the parents of the other child to address the root of the behavior, perhaps with professional guidance if the child has behavioral issues.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is to protect their child, the method might not be age-appropriate or effective. The spouse is right to question whether encouraging any form of violence, even in defense, is suitable for a young child. The parent should focus on working with the daycare to address the issue and teach the daughter non-violent ways to express her boundaries. So, the parent might be in the wrong here.\n"
