Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's hugging and kissing her in a way she finds uncomfortable, even after telling him to stop.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a child who is being physically uncomfortable by another child. The parent's approach is about teaching self-defense in a non-violent way. The child is already trying to tell the teachers, but they aren't effective. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself when adults aren't around.\n\nThe partner disagrees, thinking the child should just report it to teachers and avoid any form of violence. But the parent argues it's about using \"legit force\" when necessary. At 4 years old, the child is old enough to understand when something is uncomfortable and needs to respond, but also needs guidance on how to do so appropriately.\n\nI need to consider child development and appropriate responses for a 4-year-old. Teaching a child to assertively say no and physically push away if needed might be necessary if the other child is not respecting boundaries. However, pushing back could escalate the situation, especially if the other child retaliates. The parent's advice includes running away and telling an adult as alternatives, which is good.\n\nBut there's a line between self-defense and violence. Hugging too hard could be seen as a boundary issue, not necessarily physical aggression. Teaching a child to push back might be seen as promoting violence, even if it's for self-protection. However, the parent is not teaching her to hit or hurt, just to push away, which is a form of removing the threat without causing harm.\n\nThe alternative approach is relying on adults, but since the teachers aren't effective, the parent is trying to give the child tools to protect herself. It's a balance between empowering the child and preventing any form of violent behavior. The key is whether the parent's advice is proportionate and appropriate for a 4-year-old's understanding and actions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intent is good, encouraging a child to use physical force might not be the best approach. It's possible that teaching the child to use verbal communication more, like clearly stating \"no\" and walking away, and then going to a trusted adult immediately could be more effective. The parent's advice might be seen as promoting violence, but they argue it's necessary in a specific context. It's a tricky situation, but leaning towards the parent not being in the wrong since they're trying to protect their child's well-being.\n"
