Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another child who's using force. The key points here are the situation: another kid is hugging/kissing the daughter forcefully despite her protests. The parent advised her to push back if needed, then run and tell an adult. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to rely on teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's safety. At four years old, she's still learning boundaries. The other child's behavior is aggressive and not stopping even when told. The parent is trying to empower their daughter to protect herself, which is a common approach in some parenting styles to teach assertiveness. However, there's a line between teaching self-defense and encouraging violence. But in this case, it seems the parent is advocating for non-violent push away, not hitting. So maybe it's about setting personal boundaries.\n\nBut wait, the spouse is concerned about using any form of violence. There's a debate about whether teaching children to use physical force is appropriate, even if it's to defend themselves. However, the parent is differentiating \"legit violence\" (like pushing) as a last resort when other methods fail. The daycare teachers are not effective in stopping the other child, so the parent is preparing their daughter to handle the situation herself.\n\nAlso, the parent emphasizes that it's okay to push and then report. The question is whether teaching a child to push away is acceptable. Some might argue that even pushing can be seen as aggressive, especially at that age, and that verbal communication should be the first step. However, if the child is in a situation where her protests aren't working, teaching her to physically remove herself could be a valid self-defense measure.\n\nAnother angle is the child's age. A 4-year-old might not have the physical strength to push back effectively, but the parent is trying to give her options. The key is that the parent is not advocating for hitting or causing harm, just using minimal force to remove the unwanted contact. Also, the instruction to run and tell an adult afterward is important because it's about seeking help after trying self-defense.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the parent is trying to balance teaching self-protection with the need for reporting. The spouse's concern is valid about avoiding any violence, but in this case, the parent is addressing a specific scenario where the child's well-being is at risk. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values regarding how to handle such situations. However, given that the parent is not promoting hitting or aggression beyond pushing, and is emphasizing communication and reporting, it's likely that the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
