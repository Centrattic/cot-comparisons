Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their daughter to push away another kid who's being too aggressive with hugs and kisses. The daughter is four years old, and the other kid is also around the same age but exhibits some strange behaviors. The parents have tried telling the teachers, but they don't see it happening, and the other kid doesn't stop.\n\nSo the author's reasoning is that if someone is hurting her daughter and won't stop even when she yells, it's okay to push them away. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to just tell the teachers and avoid any form of violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's safety. At four years old, a child might not have the physical strength or the social skills to handle a situation where another child is overstepping boundaries. Teaching her to push back could lead to more aggressive interactions, maybe even escalate the situation. On the other hand, the author is trying to teach self-defense, which is a valid concept, but maybe not appropriate for this age group.\n\nAlso, the other child's parents are described as helicopter parents, which might complicate things if the situation escalates. The daycare teachers aren't effectively addressing the issue, so the parents are trying to find a solution. However, encouraging a child to use physical force against another child might not align with the daycare's policies or the parents' values regarding non-violence.\n\nThe spouse is concerned about using any form of violence, which is a common approach in parenting to prevent a cycle of aggression. The key here is whether the author's advice was an isolated incident or part of a broader philosophy. The author mentions they are straight about violence, so this is a specific case of self-defense.\n\nAnother angle is the child's understanding. A four-year-old might not fully grasp the concept of using force only when necessary and could misinterpret the advice, leading to inappropriate use of physical aggression. The spouse's point about telling a teacher is also important because that's a non-violent resolution and teaches the child to seek help when needed.\n\nIn terms of age-appropriate strategies, maybe teaching the child to say \"no\" firmly, to pull away, or to tell an adult immediately would be better. Physical pushing might not be the best solution for a child that age, as it could lead to more conflict without proper supervision.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong for teaching a four-year-old to use physical force. The spouse's approach of emphasizing non-violent solutions and relying on adults to handle the situation seems more age-appropriate and safer in the long run. The key is ensuring the child's safety while also teaching conflict resolution skills that don't involve physical aggression.\n"
