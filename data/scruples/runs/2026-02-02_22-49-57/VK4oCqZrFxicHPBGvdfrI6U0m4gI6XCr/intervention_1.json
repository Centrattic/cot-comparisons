Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the parent is in the wrong here. The situation is about their 4-year-old daughter being hugged too hard and kissed by another kid, making her uncomfortable. The parent told her it's okay to push the kid away if he's being violent and won't stop. The spouse disagrees, thinking she should just tell the teachers instead of using any form of violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4, kids are still learning boundaries and how to handle social situations. The other child is also 4, so maybe he doesn't realize his actions are too forceful. But the daughter is clearly uncomfortable, and the parent is trying to teach her to protect herself. The parent isn't encouraging violence but rather using force that's necessary to stop the uncomfortable situation. The key here is that the parent is teaching her to respond to someone who is being violent towards her.\n\nThe spouse's argument is that non-violence is better and to rely on teachers. But the teachers didn't intervene effectively when the daughter told them. So maybe the parent is right to give the daughter an alternative when the system isn't working. Also, the parent emphasizes that it's only in cases where the other kid won't stop, which is a form of legitimate self-defense.\n\nI think the parent is trying to teach appropriate self-defense in a situation where the child is being harmed. The parent isn't promoting aggression for fun but responding to a legitimate threat to her child's well-being. Therefore, the answer would be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
