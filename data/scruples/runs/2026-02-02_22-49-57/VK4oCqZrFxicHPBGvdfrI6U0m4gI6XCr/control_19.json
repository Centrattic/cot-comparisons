Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent explains that the child has tried telling the other kid to stop, the teachers aren't seeing it, and they want to teach her to defend herself. The spouse thinks it's better to only tell the teachers, but the parent argues about using \"legit force.\"\n\nHmm. So, the main issue here is about teaching a child self-defense versus non-violence. At 4 years old, kids are still learning how to handle social situations. The parent wants to empower their daughter to set boundaries, which makes sense because personal space and consent are important. But there's also the risk that a 4-year-old might not know how to apply force appropriately, leading to escalation or injury. The parent is saying to push back if necessary, but if the other kid responds aggressively, the advice is to push back again or run and tell an adult. \n\nOn the other hand, the spouse's argument is about avoiding violence entirely and relying on adults to handle it. But the parent points out that the teachers aren't seeing the incidents, so the child needs to protect herself in the moment. \n\nI need to consider child development here. Four-year-olds have impulse control issues, so even if they're taught to push back, they might not know how to de-escalate. However, the parent's approach is about using minimal force in a specific context where the child is being physically forced. The parent isn't encouraging general violence but specific self-defense in a threatening situation. \n\nAlso, teaching a child to recognize when something is uncomfortable and to act on it is important for their safety. The parent's message seems to be about self-advocacy and self-protection. The spouse's concern is valid, but maybe the key is that the parent is teaching the child to use proportionate force and then seek help. \n\nThe daycare's role is also a factor. If the teachers aren't addressing it, the child's autonomy in protecting herself might be necessary. The parent is preparing the child for situations where authority figures aren't immediately available. \n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong because they're teaching their daughter how to protect herself in a situation where she's being physically uncomfortable. The advice is specific to a scenario where the other child is being violent and not respecting her boundaries. The parent emphasizes telling an adult afterward, which is a good step. So the answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
