Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her violently. The parent argues that it's legitimate force to stop unwanted contact, especially since the daycare teachers aren't catching it. The spouse thinks they should just tell the teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is pretty young. Are they capable of understanding and using force appropriately in such situations? The parent says their daughter is clever, but at that age, kids might not always react as expected. The advice given is to push back if the other kid pushes back, which could escalate things. \n\nAlso, the situation is about unwanted physical contact. The child is being hugged and kissed forcefully, which could be a form of bullying or even inappropriate behavior, depending on the context. Teaching a child to defend themselves physically might be seen as necessary to prevent harm, especially when adults aren't intervening effectively. However, there's a risk that the child might misinterpret the situation or use force inappropriately.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse's concern is valid too. Encouraging violence, even in self-defense, can set a precedent. For a 4-year-old, the best approach might be to reinforce communication, like telling the other child to stop, moving away, and immediately telling a teacher. The daycare should have policies in place for such issues. The parent's solution might be a temporary fix but could lead to more conflict if the other child is aggressive.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and educational guidelines. Daycares usually have protocols for handling aggressive behavior. Maybe the parent should escalate the issue more formally, ensuring the daycare is aware and taking steps to address the other child's behavior. Teaching a child to use force might not be the best long-term solution.\n\nBut in an immediate situation where the child is in distress and adults aren't present, giving the child tools to protect themselves is important. The parent is trying to ensure their child's safety and comfort. However, the method of teaching them to push back might not be the most effective or safe approach.\n\nI think the parent's intention is good, but the method might be problematic. The child is very young, and physical confrontation could lead to more harm. The spouse's emphasis on non-violence and reporting is also valid. The correct approach might be a balance: teaching the child to assert their boundaries verbally and to seek help immediately, rather than using force. So, the parent might be in the wrong for encouraging physical resistance in this case.\n"
