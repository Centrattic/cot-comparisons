Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's being overly aggressive in hugging and kissing her. The parents are in a disagreement about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The child is being hugged and kissed in a way that's making her uncomfortable, even after telling the other boy to stop. The teachers aren't catching it in the act, so the problem continues. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push back or run and tell an adult if she's being harmed. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to go to teachers and avoid violence.\n\nNow, thinking about child development and parenting approaches. At 4 years old, children are learning about personal boundaries and how to handle social situations. Teaching a child to use \"legit force\" in self-defense might be necessary when other methods aren't working, but there's a concern about normalizing violence. However, the parent's instruction is specific to situations where the other child is being violent and not stopping when the child says no.\n\nAlso, the parent emphasizes that it's not about general violence but using force when there's a threat. The daughter is old enough to understand the difference, the parent argues. But some might say that even at this age, teaching a child to physically push back could escalate the situation. The spouse's point is valid too\u2014reporting to adults is a safer approach.\n\nHowever, the child has already tried communication and reporting to teachers without success. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself in a situation where she's being harmed. The advice given is about using minimal force to stop the unwanted contact, not about attacking. It's a balance between teaching self-advocacy and avoiding physical conflict.\n\nIn terms of parenting styles, some experts encourage teaching children to assert their boundaries actively, which could include physical resistance if necessary. Others might advocate for non-violent conflict resolution. But in this case, the child is experiencing what's essentially harassment from another child, and the parent is trying to ensure her safety.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the parent might not be in the wrong. They're trying to protect their daughter from ongoing harm when other measures have failed. The key is that the advice is specific to stopping violence against her, not encouraging aggression for its own sake. Therefore, the answer might be B (No). But I should also check if there's any red flags, like teaching violence in general, but the parent clarifies it's only in cases of legitimate threat. So, B seems plausible.\n"
