Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's hugging her too roughly and kissing her when she doesn't want to. The parent is trying to protect their daughter from unwanted physical contact, which is a valid concern.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a 4-year-old being subjected to forceful hugs and kisses from another child. The daughter has already told the teachers, but the behavior hasn't stopped. The parent's advice is to use physical force (pushing) if the child won't stop and the teacher isn't around. The parent also mentioned that if the other child retaliates, the daughter should push back or run and get help. \n\nNow, the partner argues that the parent is encouraging violence by telling the child to use force. However, the parent clarifies that they're not promoting general violence but teaching the child to defend herself in a situation where she's being physically harmed. The key here is whether the parent's advice is appropriate for a 4-year-old in this context.\n\nConsidering child development, at 4 years old, children are still learning about boundaries and how to express discomfort. The parent is teaching their daughter to recognize when she's uncomfortable and to take action to protect herself. While it's true that encouraging physical retaliation could escalate the situation, the parent is not promoting aggression for its own sake but rather a defensive response to unwanted contact. \n\nThe parent also emphasizes that the child should seek adult help if the situation escalates further, which is a good safety measure. However, there's a risk that a 4-year-old might not handle physical confrontation appropriately, possibly leading to a conflict where the other child feels attacked. The partner's concern about using non-violent methods like informing the teacher is valid, but in this case, the teachers haven't been effective in stopping the behavior despite prior reports.\n\nIt's important to balance teaching self-advocacy with ensuring the child doesn't engage in harmful behavior. The parent's approach seems to be about setting personal boundaries, which is a crucial life skill. However, the appropriateness of using physical force at such a young age is debatable. Some might argue that even a gentle push from a child is not considered violence but a way to express discomfort, while others might see it as a step toward aggressive behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's intention is to protect their daughter's well-being and teach her to stand up for herself. The partner's concern about promoting violence is valid, but given the context of persistent unwanted contact that the teachers haven't resolved, the parent's advice could be seen as a necessary step. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific dynamics of the daycare. The parent isn't in the wrong if the advice is intended to help the child feel safe and empowered. So, the answer is B.\n"
