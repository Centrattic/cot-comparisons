Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent's partner thinks it's better to just tell the teachers, while the parent argues that using \"legit force\" is necessary because the other child isn't stopping despite being told.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. A 4-year-old is still learning social boundaries and how to express discomfort. The parent is trying to teach self-defense, but using push away as a method. But is that appropriate for a 4-year-old? The partner's concern might be that introducing violence, even in self-defense, could lead to cycles of aggression. Also, in a daycare setting, teachers are supposed to manage interactions. The parent did mention they already tried telling the teachers, but the teachers aren't catching it. However, the daycare's role is to intervene, so maybe the parent should work more with them instead of teaching the child to handle it physically.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for escalation. If the child pushes back, the other kid might react violently. The parent acknowledges this risk but suggests pushing back again or running away. But with 4-year-olds, the reaction might not be controlled, leading to more harm. Also, the daycare's responsibility includes protecting all children, so maybe the parent should focus on getting the daycare to address the behavior more effectively, perhaps with specific strategies or involving the other parents.\n\nThe parent's approach might be well-intentioned, but teaching a young child to use physical force could be seen as promoting aggression. However, the parent is trying to teach the child to protect themselves. The line between self-defense and encouraging violence is thin here. The daycare's role is to handle such situations, so maybe the parent is overstepping by not relying more on the daycare's authority.\n\nIn terms of developmental appropriateness, a 4-year-old might not understand the difference between self-defense and aggression. The parent's reasoning that the child is \"clever enough\" might not account for the child's emotional and social maturity. Also, the daycare might have policies against any form of physical retaliation, so the parent's advice could conflict with institutional guidelines.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent might be in the wrong because they're promoting a physical response that could lead to more harm and not fully utilizing the daycare's resources. The partner's approach of relying on teachers is more aligned with standard child-rearing advice to avoid violence and seek adult intervention. So the answer is A.\n"
