Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push another kid away who's hugging her too roughly and kissing her. The parent's spouse thinks they should only tell a teacher and avoid any violence. The parent argues that it's about using legitimate force in a situation where the other child is being violent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The other child is repeatedly forcing uncomfortable hugs and kisses, even after being told to stop by the teachers. The daughter is trying to communicate this, but the behavior isn't stopping. The parent's advice is to push back or run and tell an adult if the other child resists.\n\nAt 4 years old, a child might not have the verbal skills to clearly communicate discomfort every time. The parent's approach is about self-defense, teaching the child to set boundaries. But there's a balance here. Encouraging a child to use physical force could lead to escalation. However, in this case, the other child's actions are non-consensual and possibly aggressive. The parent's instructions are specific: push away, not beat up. Also, they mention running to an adult, which is a good step.\n\nI need to think about child development. At 4, kids are learning social skills and how to handle conflicts. The parent is teaching proactive self-defense, which could be seen as necessary if the child is in a situation where she can't express her no effectively. But the spouse is worried about promoting violence. However, the scenario is about preventing unwanted physical contact, which is a form of protecting oneself.\n\nLegally and ethically, teaching a child to defend themselves from unwanted touch is generally considered good. The parent isn't encouraging aggression for no reason but responding to a specific threat. The key is that the parent is emphasizing legitimate force in response to violence, not initiating it. The advice includes running away or telling an adult, which are appropriate steps.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid, as the daycare should be involved, but the parent's approach is a practical solution when the daycare isn't effective. It's about empowering the child to protect herself in the immediate moment.\n\nSo, the parent is probably not in the wrong here. They're teaching the child a necessary self-defense tactic in a specific context. The answer is B.\n"
