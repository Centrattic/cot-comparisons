Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The parent explains that the other child's hugs and kisses are uncomfortable and sometimes even violent, and despite the daughter reporting to teachers, it's not stopping. The parent advised the daughter to push back if the other kid doesn't stop, and to run away or tell an adult if the other child retaliates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age. A 4-year-old is very young, so the parent's approach might be about teaching self-defense. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself in a situation that's causing her discomfort. The parent also emphasizes that it's only in cases of \"legit violence,\" which suggests they're not promoting aggression but rather self-protection.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse disagrees, thinking that the child should rely solely on adults and avoid using violence. There's also a concern about the child using violence, even if it's in self-defense. However, the parent is not teaching her to hit or hurt, just to push away and then report the issue. \n\nAnother angle is the daycare's responsibility. The teachers might not be effective in stopping the behavior despite being informed. The parent might feel that the daycare isn't handling the situation properly, so they're stepping in to ensure their daughter's safety.\n\nBut there's also the risk of escalating the situation. If the other child is already aggressive, teaching the daughter to push back could lead to more conflict. However, the parent is also advising her to run away or tell an adult afterward, which adds a layer of safety.\n\nLegally and ethically, parents have a duty to protect their children. Teaching a child to defend themselves in immediate danger isn't inherently wrong. However, the method and the age of the child play a role. For a 4-year-old, the ability to discern and respond appropriately might be limited. Maybe the parent's advice is too advanced for the child's maturity level.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid because introducing the idea of using force might not be the best approach for a preschooler. It's important to consider the child's emotional development. Pushing back could cause anxiety or fear of retaliation. Also, the daycare's role in creating a safe environment is crucial. The parent might need to work more closely with the teachers to address the behavior of the other child, perhaps through structured interventions or communication with the other parents.\n\nBut the parent's intention is to protect their daughter from being harmed. If the daycare isn't addressing the issue adequately, the parent has to find another way. The key is whether the parent's advice is proportionate. Pushing back is a minimal form of self-defense that doesn't involve hitting or causing harm. It's more of a boundary-setting action. The parent is teaching the child to assert her space, which is a valuable skill.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the approach, especially considering the child's age and the potential for escalation, the parent's main goal is to protect their daughter from uncomfortable and potentially harmful interactions. The advice given is about self-defense rather than aggression. Therefore, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for balancing this approach with additional strategies to address the root cause, like working with the daycare and the other parents. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but with considerations for other methods.\n"
