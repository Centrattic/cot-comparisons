Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully and kissing her, despite her protests. The parent argues that it's legitimate self-defense, while the spouse thinks they should only report to teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a 4-year-old, so their understanding of boundaries and self-defense is limited. The other child's actions are aggressive and unwelcome, even if not physically harmful. The daycare teachers aren't effective in stopping it, which adds to the concern.\n\nThe parent's advice is about using physical force as a last resort\u2014pushing back if the other kid doesn't stop. They emphasize only using force when the other child is being violent and not initiating unnecessary violence. The spouse is worried about teaching the child that violence is acceptable, which is a valid concern, especially at a young age.\n\nHowever, the parent argues that teaching the child to recognize when to use force to protect herself is important. The key here is whether the parent's advice is appropriate for a 4-year-old. At that age, children are still learning social boundaries and how to express discomfort. Encouraging physical resistance might escalate the situation or lead to more aggression. Also, the daycare's role is to manage such interactions, so relying on them might be more appropriate.\n\nBut the daycare isn't effective in this case. The parent might feel that the child isn't being protected, so their advice is a response to that. However, teaching a 4-year-old to push back could be seen as promoting violence, even if it's justified. The line between self-defense and encouraging aggression is thin here.\n\nThe spouse's point is valid too. Encouraging the child to report to teachers and use non-violent methods is a safer approach. At 4, kids don't have the maturity to assess when force is appropriate, and it might lead to more conflict. The parent might have good intentions, but the method could be problematic.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent might be in the wrong because they're encouraging physical responses in a very young child, which could lead to more violence and doesn't teach conflict resolution skills. The answer is likely A.\n"
