Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is at fault for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's giving her violent hugs and kisses. The parent's reasoning is that the other child is being aggressive and not stopping even when told, so using force to protect herself is justified. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is very young, and their understanding of boundaries and conflict resolution is still developing. The parent is trying to teach self-defense in a situation where the other child's behavior is harmful. The parent isn't encouraging ongoing violence but rather immediate self-protection when other measures (telling adults) haven't worked. The spouse is concerned about promoting violence, which is a valid point, but the parent is emphasizing self-defense against unwelcome physical force. \n\nI should also think about the context: the daycare teachers aren't effectively addressing the issue, so the parent wants to empower the child to protect herself. However, using physical force might escalate the situation or teach the wrong lesson about handling conflicts. There's a balance between teaching self-defense and promoting non-violence. At such a young age, it's possible the child might not fully understand the difference between appropriate and inappropriate force, leading to misuse.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and ethical perspective. In some contexts, self-defense is justified when someone is being harmed, but for a child, the approach might need to be different. The daycare's responsibility is to manage such interactions, so maybe the parent should focus on working with the daycare and the other child's parents instead of teaching the child to use force. However, the parent's concern is valid if the daycare isn't effective.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, they're trying to protect their child from harm. On the other hand, teaching a 4-year-old to use physical force might not be the best approach, especially since children at that age may not discern when force is appropriate. The spouse's concern about promoting violence isn't off-base. The parent might be overstepping by encouraging physical retaliation, which could lead to more aggressive behavior in the child or escalate conflicts. The correct approach might involve more communication with the daycare and possibly involving the other parents to address the underlying issue, rather than teaching the child to confront the behavior physically.\n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong (A) because they're promoting a violent solution that might not be suitable for a young child, even if the intent is self-defense.\n"
