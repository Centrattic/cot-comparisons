Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard or kissing her when she doesn't want to. The parent argues that it's appropriate to use \"legit force\" when the other child is being violent and not respecting her wishes. The spouse disagrees, thinking the kid should go to the teachers instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is very young, so their understanding of boundaries and conflict resolution is still developing. The situation involves another child who's persistently hugging and kissing her in a way she finds uncomfortable. The parent is teaching her to push back if she feels unsafe. \n\nThe key points here are consent, self-defense, and appropriate age-based strategies. At 4, kids might not have the verbal skills to articulate their discomfort effectively in the moment. Teachers might not always catch the behavior, as the parent mentioned. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself immediately, which is a form of self-defense. However, the spouse is concerned about encouraging violence, even if it's defensive.\n\nBut is pushing back considered violence in this context? The other child is initiating unwanted physical contact, which is a form of aggression. The parent is teaching the daughter to stop the aggression, which could be seen as a necessary self-defense measure. However, there's a risk that the child might escalate the situation or use excessive force, though the parent mentions not advocating for general violence, just in specific cases where there's forced contact.\n\nAnother angle is the developmental appropriateness. A 4-year-old might not fully grasp the nuances of \"legit force\" versus overreacting. The parent's advice is to push back and run away if needed. But should a 4-year-old be handling this on their own? Maybe the parent should have also reinforced immediate reporting to an adult as a priority, even if they also teach some self-defense.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid because involving adults is a more structured way to address the issue. However, if the teachers aren't responding effectively, the parent might feel the need to give the child tools to protect herself. There's a balance between teaching self-advocacy and relying on adults for support.\n\nIn terms of child safety, it's important to teach children to say no and protect themselves when they can't express it. But teaching a 4-year-old to push someone might lead to unintended consequences if she misapplies it. The parent might not be in the wrong, but the approach could be debated. Maybe a better strategy is to teach the child to say \"no\" firmly, walk away, and tell an adult immediately, while also ensuring that the daycare is aware and takes proactive steps to address the other child's behavior.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent is trying to protect their child from uncomfortable and unwanted physical contact. While the spouse prefers non-violent solutions, the parent's approach isn't entirely wrong. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but with the note that there's room for improvement in the strategy.\n"
