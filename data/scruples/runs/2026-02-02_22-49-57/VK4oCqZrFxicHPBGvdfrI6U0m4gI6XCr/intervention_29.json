Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged and kissed too forcefully by another kid at daycare. The parents are divided on how to handle it. The author told the daughter it's okay to push the other kid away if he's being violent and not stopping when she yells. The spouse thinks the kid should just report to teachers and not use violence at all. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is pretty young, and their understanding of personal boundaries and how to handle conflict is still developing. The other child is being aggressive, not respecting the daughter's attempts to stop the interaction. The teachers aren't effectively addressing the issue, so the parents are stepping in.\n\nThe author's approach is about teaching the daughter self-defense in a situation where she's being physically forced into uncomfortable contact. The parent argues that it's legitimate force to stop violence. But the spouse is worried about encouraging violence between kids, even if it's in self-defense.\n\nI should think about child development here. At 4, children might not have the verbal or social skills to assert themselves effectively. The daughter is already trying to tell the teachers, but it's not working. So the parent's solution is to teach her to take physical action. But is that appropriate? Some might say that even at that age, using physical force could escalate the situation or teach the child that violence is an acceptable response. Others might argue that the child has the right to protect herself from unwanted, forceful contact, especially when adults aren't intervening.\n\nAlso, the parent is clear that they're not promoting general violence but specific, necessary force in a specific context. The daughter was already aware of the problem, and the parent is trying to equip her with a tool when other methods (telling adults) aren't working. However, the spouse's concern is valid too\u2014teaching a child to use physical force could have unintended consequences, like the other child retaliating or the daughter becoming overly aggressive.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and ethical aspect. In many places, using reasonable force to protect oneself is considered acceptable. But this is between children, so the standards might be different. The parent is trying to teach the child to recognize when force is necessary and how to respond. But again, there's a line between self-defense and encouraging aggression.\n\nI think the key points are: the other child is being violent and not respecting the daughter's boundaries, the teachers aren't effective, and the parent is trying to help the daughter protect herself. The parent's advice is specific and limited to the situation where the other child is being aggressive. The spouse is concerned about the broader implications, but the parent is trying to teach a specific, context-dependent skill.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, teaching a child to use force to defend herself when others aren't helping could be seen as necessary. On the other hand, even if it's in self-defense, it's about violence between children. The parent might be right in wanting to protect their child, but the spouse's caution is also valid. Depending on the cultural or parenting philosophy, the answer might vary. But given that the parent is not promoting general violence and is addressing a specific, ongoing issue where other solutions have failed, I think the parent is not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
