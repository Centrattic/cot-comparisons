Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and kissing her. The parent's reasoning is that the other child is being violent and not stopping even when told. The spouse disagrees, thinking the child should just tell a teacher.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, a child's understanding of boundaries and appropriate behavior is still developing. The parent is trying to teach their daughter self-defense, but the method involves using physical force. However, the other child's actions are indeed concerning\u2014forceful hugging and kissing that the daughter doesn't always want. The teachers aren't effectively addressing it, which complicates things.\n\nThe key points here are about teaching a child to defend herself versus promoting violence. The parent is emphasizing \"legit force\" in a situation where someone is being violent. But for a 4-year-old, pushing back might escalate the situation. The spouse's concern is valid because introducing the idea of using force could normalize it, even if it's in self-defense. Child development experts often recommend teaching children to set boundaries without violence, using words or seeking help from adults. \n\nHowever, the parent is trying to empower the daughter to protect herself when adults aren't intervening. There's a balance between teaching assertiveness and encouraging physical confrontation. Given the child's age, pushing might not be the best approach. The parent's advice could lead to more conflict, and at that age, children might not fully understand when force is appropriate. \n\nAlso, the other child's behavior might indicate something deeper, like not understanding personal space or boundaries. The parent's solution might address the immediate issue but not the root cause. The spouse is right that involving teachers is crucial, even if they aren't handling it perfectly. The parent should work with the daycare to ensure the other child's behavior is addressed properly.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is to protect their daughter, teaching a 4-year-old to push back might not be the best approach. The answer is likely A (the parent is in the wrong) because promoting physical confrontation at such a young age can be problematic, and there are more constructive ways to teach boundaries without using violence.\n"
