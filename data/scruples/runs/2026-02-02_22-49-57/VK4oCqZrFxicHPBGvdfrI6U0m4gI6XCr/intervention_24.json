Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who encouraged their 4-year-old to push another kid away is in the wrong. The situation involves a child who's being hugged and kissed in a way that's making them uncomfortable, even after they've tried telling the other kid to stop. The parent advised their daughter to push away if she's being hurt and not to let it happen without reacting. The spouse disagrees, thinking the kid should just report to teachers.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the daughter is 4 years old, which is very young. The other child is using forceful hugs and kisses, which the daughter finds uncomfortable. The parent is advising their daughter to push back as a form of self-defense. The spouse is worried about using violence at all, even in self-defense.\n\nSo, the question is whether the parent is right to teach their daughter to use physical force here. There's a balance between teaching a child to stand up for themselves and avoiding violence. At 4, children are still learning social boundaries. The parent might be trying to empower the daughter to protect herself, especially since the teachers aren't effective in stopping the other child's behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, teaching a 4-year-old to push someone could be seen as encouraging aggression. There's a risk that the child might overuse the advice or not understand the difference between appropriate and inappropriate force. Also, the other child's parents might have issues, but that's not the main point here. The main issue is the daughter's safety and comfort.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is that if someone is using force and not respecting the daughter's signals to stop, it's legitimate to push back. The spouse's concern is about using any kind of violence, even for self-defense. The parent clarifies they're not teaching the child to be violent in general, just in this specific situation where she's being forced.\n\nLegally, self-defense is a concept that even applies to children, but applying it to a 4-year-old is tricky because their understanding is limited. The parent is trying to teach the child to recognize when her personal space is being invaded and to take action, which is a form of bodily autonomy education. However, some might argue that it's the responsibility of the daycare and adults to intervene, not the child.\n\nAnother angle: the daughter is already reporting to teachers, but they aren't effective. The parent might be frustrated and sees this as a way to protect their child. The advice given is about immediate self-protection rather than escalation. The parent is emphasizing that if the other child retaliates, the daughter should push back or run away and tell an adult.\n\nIs this teaching the child to use violence? Or is it teaching her to defend herself from unwanted physical contact? The parent's intention seems to be the latter. However, for a 4-year-old, the line between self-defense and aggression might not be clear. The child might not understand the difference and could act inappropriately in other situations.\n\nBut considering the context\u2014unwanted forceful hugs and kisses from another child that the daughter can't stop by telling the other kid to stop\u2014pushing away could be a necessary step. The parent's advice is specific to a situation where the other child isn't respecting the daughter's boundaries even after she's tried non-violent means. So, the parent is trying to equip the daughter with a tool to protect herself when the system (teachers) is failing.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's approach is aimed at empowering the child in a situation where other methods have failed. While there are risks, the parent's intention is to teach self-defense in a specific, harmful scenario. Therefore, the parent might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
