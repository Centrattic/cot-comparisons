Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. The situation involves a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged and kissed too forcefully by another kid at daycare. The parent told her it's okay to push the other child away if she's uncomfortable, and even suggested pushing back or running away if the other kid reacts. The spouse disagrees, saying she should just tell the teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4, she's pretty young, so her understanding of boundaries and conflict resolution is still developing. The parent is teaching self-defense by allowing her to use force when she's being forced. But is physical retaliation appropriate for a child that age? Maybe there's a line between defending oneself and escalating a situation.\n\nThe daycare's role is also important. The parent mentioned the teachers aren't seeing the behavior and the other kid doesn't stop when asked. So, maybe the daycare isn't equipped to handle it, but that doesn't mean the child should handle it on her own. The parent's advice could be seen as protecting the child's autonomy and safety, but using physical force might set a precedent for resolving conflicts. Also, the parent wants the child to recognize when force is necessary, which is a good lesson, but at such a young age, the child might not have the judgment to differentiate between appropriate and excessive force.\n\nThe spouse's concern is about teaching non-violence. It's a valid point because encouraging any form of violence, even in self-defense, might be seen as promoting aggression. However, the parent is specifically talking about defending against unwanted physical contact, which is a safety issue. The key here is whether the parent's advice is reasonable given the child's age and the specific situation.\n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. Many places have laws about self-defense for children, but I'm not sure how that applies to a 4-year-old. It's more about the ethical and developmental considerations. The child's ability to understand and apply the advice is crucial. If the child is in a situation where she's being forced into physical contact, teaching her to remove herself is one thing, but pushing back might lead to more conflict or injury.\n\nAlso, the daycare's responsibility is to manage such interactions. The parent might be trying to supplement the daycare's shortcomings. However, if the teachers aren't effective, it's possible the parent is right to take matters into their own hands. But the spouse's point about telling an adult is also valid, maybe the parent should reinforce that as the primary action.\n\nIn conclusion, there's a balance between teaching a child to protect herself and not encouraging violence. The parent's advice might be well-intentioned but could lead to unintended consequences. However, given the child's age and the specific context, it's a tough call. The answer might depend on cultural or educational perspectives on child-rearing.\n"
