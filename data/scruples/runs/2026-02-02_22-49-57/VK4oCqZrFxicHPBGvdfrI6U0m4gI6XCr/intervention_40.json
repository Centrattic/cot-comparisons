Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent who encouraged their 4-year-old to push away another child is in the wrong. The situation involves a daycare kid who's hugging and kissing the daughter in a way that's uncomfortable, even after she's told him to stop. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push back if needed, while the spouse thinks they should rely on teachers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and understanding. At 4, kids are still learning social boundaries. The daughter is already reporting the issue to teachers, but they haven't stopped it. The parent is concerned about their child's safety and autonomy. The spouse argues against any violence, but the parent is teaching self-defense in a specific context\u2014when there's force and the child is in danger.\n\nIt's important to note that the parent isn't advocating for general violence but teaching the child how to set boundaries. The key here is the child feeling empowered to protect themselves. While some might argue that adults should handle it, in this case, the teachers aren't effective, so the parent is providing a solution when immediate help isn't available.\n\nAlso, the parent emphasizes using force only when there's a threat, which is a legitimate form of self-defense. The spouse's concern is valid, but the parent's approach is about teaching the child to trust their instincts and stay safe. Given that the child is already in a vulnerable situation and the parent is providing practical steps, I think the parent isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
