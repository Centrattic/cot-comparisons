Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully.\n\nFirst, the situation: the daughter is being hugged aggressively by another child. She's tried telling the other kid to stop but he doesn't. The parents have talked to the teachers, but it's not being addressed. The parent tells the daughter it's okay to push back if the kid won't stop, and even if the other kid reacts, she should push back or run and tell an adult.\n\nThe other parent (SO) thinks it's wrong to encourage any form of violence, even in self-defense. The parent argues that it's about using \"legit force\" in a situation where the other kid is being violent. The question is whether the parent is at fault here.\n\nHmm. So the key points are: teaching a young child to defend herself when she's being physically assaulted. The issue is whether teaching a child to use force is appropriate, even if it's in response to force. \n\nOn one hand, the parent is trying to protect their daughter's well-being, teaching her to stand up for herself when others are being aggressive. At 4 years old, children are developing their understanding of boundaries. If the other child is being overly forceful and the teachers aren't stopping it, the parent might feel it's necessary to empower their daughter.\n\nOn the other hand, the SO argues that encouraging any form of violence, even in self-defense, could lead to more aggression and that the right approach is to rely on adults (teachers) to intervene. There's a concern that teaching a child to use physical force might model inappropriate behavior, even if the intention is to protect.\n\nAlso, the child is very young. At 4, she's still learning social skills. The parent is giving her specific instructions, which might be beyond her ability to process, especially if the other child reacts violently. The parent's advice includes \"push back again and/or run away and tell an adult,\" but a 4-year-old might not know how to handle a confrontation effectively.\n\nBut the parent isn't encouraging random violence; it's specifically in response to ongoing forceful actions that the child has reported as uncomfortable. The parent is teaching her to set boundaries, which is a part of social and emotional learning. However, the method (pushing back) could be seen as promoting physical conflict rather than verbal communication.\n\nThere's also the aspect of teaching a child to assess a situation and decide when to use force. Some might argue that even at 4, a child can understand that if someone is hurting them and won't stop, it's okay to stop the hurt. Others might think that any violence is a bad example, regardless of context.\n\nIn terms of child development, it's important to teach children to express their discomfort and seek help. However, in this case, the teachers aren't intervening effectively, so the parent is stepping in to fill that gap. The parent's advice might be a way to ensure the child's safety when the system isn't working.\n\nBut there's a risk that the child might escalate the situation if she pushes the other kid, leading to more conflict. The parent is trying to balance between teaching self-defense and maintaining a non-violent approach. It's a tricky situation because the child is very young and the parent's advice could have unintended consequences.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. If the parent's intention is to protect their daughter from ongoing physical discomfort and the advice is specific to stopping an immediate threat, then maybe not. However, if the approach encourages using violence as a first response, that could be problematic. The parent is not teaching random aggression but a specific response to a specific problem. However, the SO's point is valid that relying on adults (teachers) is the standard approach in such situations.\n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework, the community often looks at intentions and whether the action is reasonable. The parent's intent is to protect their child from ongoing physical harm. The method is teaching the child to use force to stop the harm. Whether that's acceptable is debatable. Some might say it's reasonable to teach a child to protect themselves when others are not doing so. Others might say that any use of violence, even in self-defense, is a bad set of values for a child to learn.\n\nConsidering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the parent is addressing a real issue the child is facing and providing a practical solution. The alternative, relying solely on the teachers who aren't effective, might not be better. So the parent's approach could be seen as justified. However, there's a risk in encouraging a child to use physical force, even if it's in self-defense. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal values.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent is likely not in the wrong (B), as their intention is to protect their child from ongoing physical discomfort and they're teaching a specific, necessary response to a specific threat. However, there's room for discussion about the appropriateness of the method.\n"
