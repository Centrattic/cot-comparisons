Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too roughly. The parent argues that it's legitimate self-defense, while the spouse thinks she should rely on teachers instead of using violence. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The child is being physically uncomfortable by another kid's hugs and kisses, which she's told the teachers but they haven't addressed effectively. The parent is teaching her to push back if the other kid won't stop, even suggesting pushing back or running away if the other child reacts.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about teaching a young child to use physical force to defend herself. The parent's reasoning is that the other kid is being violent and the daughter has the right to protect herself. The spouse thinks it's better to rely on adults and not resort to violence at all.\n\nNow, considering the age of the child, 4 years old, they're still very young and may not fully understand the nuances of their actions. Teaching a child to push someone back might escalate the situation, especially if the other child reacts aggressively. However, the parent might be trying to empower the child to stand up for herself, which is a valid concern. But there's a risk that the child might misinterpret the message or use it inappropriately in other contexts.\n\nAnother aspect is the concept of consent and boundaries. The daughter is being taught to recognize when she's uncomfortable and to take action. However, the method of action (pushing) could be seen as promoting violence, even if it's defensive. The parent might be trying to balance self-defense with teaching non-violence.\n\nThe spouse's concern is about avoiding violence altogether, which is a common parenting approach. They might be worried that even minor physical responses could set a precedent for aggressive behavior. But in this case, the parent is responding to a situation where the other child isn't respecting the daughter's boundaries and the teachers aren't intervening effectively.\n\nThere's also the legal and ethical angle. In many places, self-defense is a concept that allows for reasonable force to protect oneself. However, teaching a 4-year-old about self-defense is tricky because their judgment isn't mature enough. The parent might be overstepping by encouraging physical resistance when the alternative is to seek help from adults, which the daughter has already tried without success.\n\nBut wait, the daughter has already tried telling the teachers and screaming, which the parent acknowledges. So the parent is giving the daughter options when the other methods fail. The parent might be trying to ensure the daughter's safety when the system (teachers) isn't working. However, pushing could still be seen as inappropriate, even if it's defensive. The parent might not consider other non-violent options, like moving away, or the teachers' possible interventions despite their current ineffectiveness.\n\nIn terms of child development, teaching a child to use physical force might not be the best approach. It's important to teach them to communicate their feelings, seek help, and understand non-violent conflict resolution. But in a situation where the child feels threatened and adults aren't helping, the parent might feel justified in teaching self-defense.\n\nThe key points are: the other child's behavior is aggressive and persistent, the teachers aren't effective, the daughter is old enough to understand, but using physical force could lead to more problems. The parent's approach is to empower the child, but the spouse thinks it's promoting violence.\n\nSo, is the parent wrong? It depends on the perspective. If promoting self-defense in a controlled way to protect the child from ongoing harm, maybe not. But if it's encouraging unnecessary violence, then yes. However, since the other methods have failed, and the parent is teaching the child to protect herself, the parent's intention might be to prevent further harm.\n\nBut considering the child's age and the potential consequences, maybe the parent is in the wrong for encouraging physical confrontation. There might be better strategies, like reinforcing communication with teachers, involving parents of the other child, or finding alternative ways to de-escalate the situation without violence.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (the parent is in the wrong) because encouraging a 4-year-old to use physical force could lead to more aggression and isn't the best method for conflict resolution, even if the intention is to protect.\n"
