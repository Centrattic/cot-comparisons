Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing them too forcefully. The parent's partner thinks it's better to just tell the teachers and not use violence. The parent argues it's about self-defense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4, kids might not fully understand the concept of boundaries and how to handle such situations. The parent is teaching the child to use force if the other kid won't stop, which could escalate things. The partner's point is about non-violence, maybe to avoid making the child more aggressive. \n\nAlso, the daycare teachers haven't been able to handle the situation effectively. The parent might think the child needs to protect themselves since adults aren't stopping it. But is it appropriate to teach a 4-year-old to use physical force? Maybe there's a line between self-defense and encouraging violence. The key here is whether the parent's advice is proportionate. Pushing back to stop unwanted contact could be seen as a reasonable self-defense measure for a child, especially since the other kid isn't stopping when asked. However, the parent's partner is concerned about normalizing violence. \n\nAnother angle: teaching a child to assert their boundaries is important, but maybe the parent should have focused more on verbal strategies first. However, the child has already tried verbalizing and the other kid doesn't stop. So physical action might be the next step. But at 4, is pushing back the best approach? Maybe it's too aggressive for the situation. Also, the child's fear of retaliation is a factor. The parent's advice to push back or run away might not be safe. \n\nIn terms of child development, 4-year-olds might not have the judgment to assess when force is appropriate. The parent might be overstepping by giving such direct instructions. The partner's approach of relying on adults might be better, even if the teachers aren't effective. Maybe the parent should have worked more closely with the daycare to find a solution rather than teaching the child to defend themselves physically. \n\nSo, considering all this, the parent might be in the wrong (A) because teaching a young child to use force could lead to more aggressive behavior and might not be the best way to handle the situation. The situation does involve the child's safety and boundaries, but there could be more constructive methods than encouraging physical retaliation.\n"
