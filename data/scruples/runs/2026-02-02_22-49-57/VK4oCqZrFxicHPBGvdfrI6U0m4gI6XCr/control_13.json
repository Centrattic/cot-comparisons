Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent told the daughter to push back if she's uncomfortable and to run away or tell an adult if the other child reacts aggressively. The spouse disagrees, arguing that the child should only tell the teachers and not use violence at all.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The other child is a 4-year-old who's being overly aggressive in his greetings. The daughter has already told the teachers, but it's not working. The parent is trying to teach the daughter self-defense in a situation where she's being forced into uncomfortable physical contact. The parent emphasizes \"legit force\" in a specific context where the other child isn't respecting boundaries.\n\nFrom a child safety perspective, teaching a child to protect themselves is important. However, teaching violence even in self-defense might be problematic. But in this case, it's not about using violence for aggression; it's about setting boundaries. At 4 years old, the child might not have the social skills to handle this on her own, so the parent is trying to equip her with tools to protect herself. The spouse's concern is valid too\u2014if the child starts pushing, it could escalate. But the parent argues that it's a legitimate response to unwanted physical contact.\n\nI should also think about developmental appropriateness. A 4-year-old might not have the emotional maturity to assess when to use force and when not. However, the parent is teaching the child to recognize when the contact is uncomfortable and to take action. The advice given seems to be about asserting her boundaries, not about aggressive behavior. The parent isn't advocating for general violence but a specific response to a specific situation.\n\nAnother angle is the role of the daycare. The daughter has already reported it, and the teachers aren't effective. The parent might feel that the child needs personal strategies because the system isn't working. However, the spouse's point is that the child should rely on authority figures more, which is a common approach in child-rearing.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a nuanced situation. Different parenting styles might lead to different conclusions. Some might say that the parent is empowering the child to protect herself, which is good. Others might say that teaching a child to use physical force could lead to more problems. But given the context of the other child's persistent behavior and the daughter's discomfort, the parent's intention seems protective.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the parent not being in the wrong because they're teaching the child to recognize boundaries and take action when others aren't respecting them. However, it's a close call. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
