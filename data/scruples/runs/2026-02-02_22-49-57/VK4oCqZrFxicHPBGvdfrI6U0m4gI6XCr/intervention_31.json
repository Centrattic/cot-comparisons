Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging her too forcefully. The situation involves a child who's being hugged and kissed in a way that's making her uncomfortable, and the parents are split on how to handle it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Four-year-olds might not fully understand boundaries or how to express discomfort. The other child's behavior is described as \"violent\" hugging and kissing, which the daughter finds uncomfortable, even though she sometimes laughs it off. The parents tried telling the teachers, but it didn't resolve the issue.\n\nThe author's approach was to teach the daughter to use force if needed to stop the uncomfortable contact. The spouse disagrees, thinking they should rely on teachers and avoid any violence. The key here is whether teaching a 4-year-old to push back is appropriate. \n\nChildren that age often lack the emotional regulation and physical strength to handle such situations safely. Pushing someone might escalate the conflict, leading to more harm. Also, teaching violence as a solution can be problematic, even if it's to stop unwanted contact. There's a difference between self-defense and aggressive behavior, but at four, the child might not grasp that nuance.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to protect their daughter from being hurt, which is a parent's duty. However, the method might be inappropriate for a child's development. The spouse's concern about non-violent solutions is valid. Maybe alternative strategies, like teaching the daughter to say \"no\" clearly, using body language like stepping back, or finding an adult immediately, would be better. The daycare might need more proactive intervention, like separating the children during greetings or addressing the other child's behavior more directly.\n\nAlso, the other child's parents being overbearing might contribute to his behavior, so maybe involving the daycare or parents more effectively could help. At four, pushing could be seen as aggressive and might not teach the child how to handle boundaries in a social setting. The author's advice might be well-intentioned but could have unintended consequences, like the daughter using force inappropriately elsewhere.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, parents have a responsibility to protect their child's well-being. However, teaching a child to use physical force at such a young age might not be the best approach. It's a balance between immediate safety and long-term social skills. The author's answer would depend on prioritizing immediate protection versus teaching non-violent conflict resolution.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the right by wanting to protect their daughter, but the method could be questioned. However, since the daughter is in daycare, maybe the parents should focus more on working with the daycare to resolve the issue rather than teaching a child to push back. The spouse's concern about using violence is valid, especially given the child's age. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for advising physical action instead of non-violent solutions.\n"
