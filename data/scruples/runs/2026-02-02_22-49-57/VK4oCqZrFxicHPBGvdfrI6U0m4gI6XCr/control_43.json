Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is at fault for advising their 4-year-old to push away another child who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent argues that it's legitimate self-defense, while the spouse thinks it's better to rely on teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and maturity of the child. A 4-year-old might not fully understand the concept of boundaries or how to respond appropriately. The parent is teaching her to use force if necessary, which could be seen as empowering the child to protect herself. However, there's a risk that the child might escalate the situation, either by pushing back or not knowing when to stop. \n\nOn the other hand, the spouse's concern is about promoting non-violence. Daycares typically handle such situations with staff intervention, so the parent's approach might conflict with institutional policies. The child has already reported the issue, but the teachers aren't able to stop it, so the parent is trying an alternative method.\n\nI should also think about the child's safety. If the other child is aggressive and doesn't respond to verbal cues, the daughter might need a way to stop the unwanted contact. Teaching her to set physical boundaries could prevent her from feeling helpless. But there's a line between self-defense and encouraging aggression. The parent's advice is specific to a situation where the other child is being violent, which might justify the response.\n\nAnother angle is the child's ability to discern when to use such actions. At 4, can she reliably tell the difference between a playful hug and a violent one? The parent believes she can, but there's a chance the child might misinterpret other interactions as needing a push.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: In some contexts, teaching children to use force might not be advisable unless it's for their immediate safety. However, the parent isn't encouraging general violence but a specific response to being forced into unwanted physical contact. \n\nChild development experts often recommend teaching kids to say \"no\" and remove themselves from uncomfortable situations. Physical pushing might not be the best approach, but in the absence of effective adult intervention, it's a response to protect the child. The parent is trying to equip the child with tools when other methods have failed.\n\nI need to weigh whether the parent's approach is reasonable given the circumstances. Since the teachers aren't effective, and the child is facing repeated unwanted contact, advising self-defense might be justified. However, it's possible that the daycare should have more effective strategies. The parent might not be in the wrong here, but it's a delicate situation where both perspectives have merit.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (No), because the parent is trying to protect their child in a situation where other measures haven't worked, and the advice is specific to defending against unwanted force.\n"
