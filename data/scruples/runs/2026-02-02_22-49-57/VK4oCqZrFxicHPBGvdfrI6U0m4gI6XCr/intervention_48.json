Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's hugging and kissing her in a way that's uncomfortable and sometimes forceful. The parent's reasoning is that if someone is causing harm and not stopping when told, it's okay to push back. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to tell a teacher and avoid violence altogether.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a child who's being physically overwhelmed by another child's actions. The daycare teachers aren't effectively addressing the issue because they don't see it happen. The parent wants to empower their daughter to protect herself in the moment. At 4 years old, kids are still learning boundaries and how to handle social interactions. \n\nThe parent isn't encouraging general violence but specific self-defense in a situation where the other child isn't respecting the daughter's wishes. The advice includes pushing back as a last resort and then telling an adult. The parent also mentions that they're clear about not using violence otherwise. The spouse's concern is valid\u2014using physical force could escalate the situation or teach the wrong lessons. However, the parent is trying to teach their daughter to recognize when she's in danger and take immediate action if necessary.\n\nIn child development, it's important to balance teaching self-advocacy with safety. The parent might be right in giving the child tools to protect herself when other methods (like telling a teacher) aren't effective. However, the spouse's point about non-violent solutions is also valid. The key here is whether the parent's advice is proportionate. Pushing away a hug might be a reasonable response for a child in that moment, especially if it's the only way to stop the unwanted contact. The parent is emphasizing consent and bodily autonomy, which are important concepts to teach early.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a risk that the child might act out aggressively without understanding the consequences. The daycare environment needs consistent adult supervision, so maybe the solution lies in the teachers being more proactive. The parent could also work with the daycare to address the other child's behavior more effectively. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a nuanced situation. The parent's intention is to protect their daughter's well-being and teach her to stand up for herself, which is necessary. However, the spouse's concern about teaching violence is also a valid perspective. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about raising children. But given the context, the parent's advice seems reasonable as a temporary measure until the daycare can address the issue properly. So, probably not in the wrong.\n"
