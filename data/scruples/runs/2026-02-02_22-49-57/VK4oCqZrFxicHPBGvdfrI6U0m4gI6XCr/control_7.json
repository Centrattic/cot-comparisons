Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their daughter to push away another kid who's giving her forceful hugs and kisses she doesn't like. The daughter tried telling the teachers but it didn't stop. The parent advised her to push back if needed and run away and tell an adult. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to go to teachers and avoid violence.\n\nHmm. So, the main points here are about teaching a child self-defense versus non-violence. The parent is trying to protect their daughter from uncomfortable situations where she can't get help from adults. The advice given is to use force if necessary but not to escalate beyond self-defense. The spouse is concerned about encouraging violence, which is a common debate in parenting. \n\nIn a 4-year-old, the child might not have the physical strength or the awareness to use force effectively, and pushing back could lead to more conflict. However, the parent is trying to teach the child to set boundaries and protect herself. The child already reported it, but the teachers didn't act. So maybe the parent felt the system isn't working.\n\nBut promoting physical resistance might not be the best approach in a daycare setting. The child might get into trouble, or it could escalate the other child's behavior. Also, the daycare's role is to manage such situations, so maybe the parent should have focused more on working with the daycare to ensure they monitor the behavior better. \n\nHowever, the parent's intention is to protect their child from being uncomfortable and to teach her to stand up for herself. The advice doesn't encourage aggression but self-defense in a specific context. It's a balance between teaching a child to protect themselves and maintaining a non-violent approach. \n\nIn some parenting philosophies, using physical force is discouraged unless absolutely necessary, especially with young children. Others might argue that it's important for kids to learn to set boundaries from an early age. The child's well-being is the priority here. \n\nI think the parent isn't entirely wrong because they're trying to address a real problem their child is facing. But maybe there's a better way, like working with the daycare more closely or teaching the child to seek help immediately. The spouse's point about non-violence is valid too. So maybe the parent is not in the wrong, but perhaps the approach could be adjusted. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
