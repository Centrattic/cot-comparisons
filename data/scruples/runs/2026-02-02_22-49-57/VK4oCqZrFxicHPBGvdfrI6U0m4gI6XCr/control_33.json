Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're at fault for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another child who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The daughter has already told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent's reasoning is that if someone is using force and not listening when told to stop, it's okay to push back or run away and tell an adult.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Four years old is very young, and their understanding of social boundaries and conflict resolution is still developing. The parent is trying to empower their child to protect herself, which is a valid concern because consent and personal space are important from an early age.\n\nHowever, the spouse is concerned about using violence. The parent clarifies they didn't encourage general violence but specific, defensive actions. The question is whether teaching a 4-year-old to push someone back is appropriate. At that age, children might not fully grasp the difference between defensive actions and aggressive ones. They could misinterpret the message, leading to more physical altercations, which daycare staff would need to manage.\n\nThe daycare's role is also important. The parent mentioned the teachers haven't been effective yet, but maybe there's a follow-up needed. The parent's approach might be seen as taking matters into their own hands instead of relying on the daycare's protocols. However, the parent's concern about the child's safety and comfort is valid. \n\nLegally and ethically, teaching a child to defend themselves in cases of unwanted physical contact is about consent and safety. The parent is addressing a real issue where the child feels uncomfortable. But there's a balance between self-defense and escalating the situation. The daycare's responsibility is to provide a safe environment, so the parent might be justified in wanting to ensure their child isn't in a constant state of fear.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's intention is to protect their child, which is a natural instinct. However, the method of teaching physical resistance might not be the best approach for a 4-year-old, given their maturity level. The spouse's concern about not encouraging violence is also valid. It's a tricky situation where both perspectives have merit. The parent might not be entirely at fault, but there's room for discussion on alternative strategies, like reinforcing verbal communication with the teachers or the daycare implementing stricter supervision.\n"
