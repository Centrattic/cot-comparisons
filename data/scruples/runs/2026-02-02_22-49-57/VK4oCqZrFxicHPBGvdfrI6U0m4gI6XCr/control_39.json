Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The parent argues that it's legitimate self-defense because the other child isn't stopping despite being told, and the teachers aren't effective. The spouse thinks it's better to rely on adults and not use violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider developmental aspects. A 4-year-old may not fully understand the concept of consent or appropriate boundaries. Their actions are impulsive, so instructing them to push back could lead to escalation. Also, teaching a child to use physical force, even as self-defense, might normalize violence as a solution, which could be problematic in other contexts.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to protect their child from discomfort and potential harm. The other child's behavior is indeed inappropriate, especially since he doesn't stop when told and uses force. The parent's advice includes not just pushing but also running away and telling an adult, which is part of the message. So it's not entirely about using violence but also about seeking help.\n\nHowever, the spouse's concern is valid too. Encouraging a child to use physical force might not be the best approach. There are alternative strategies like reinforcing verbal communication, teaching the child to clearly say \"no\" and seek adult help immediately. The daycare staff should be more proactive in addressing the issue if it's persistent.\n\nAlso, the effectiveness of the parent's advice is questionable. If the other child might retaliate, a 4-year-old might not know how to handle that. The parent's approach might lead to more conflict rather than resolution.\n\nIn terms of child development, it's crucial to teach conflict resolution without violence. The parents' values about non-violence are important, but balancing that with real-world scenarios where a child needs to protect themselves is tricky. The parent's justification is that it's \"legit force,\" but the child's understanding of that might not align with societal norms.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the advice might not be the best approach. There are more constructive methods to handle such situations, focusing on communication and seeking adult assistance rather than resorting to physical force, even if it's defensive. Therefore, the parent could be seen as in the wrong for not providing alternative solutions and encouraging physical action.\n"
