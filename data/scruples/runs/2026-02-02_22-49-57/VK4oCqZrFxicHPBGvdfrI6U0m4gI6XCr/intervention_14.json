Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is at fault for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another child who's hugging her too roughly. The parent's partner disagrees, thinking it's better to report to teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The other child's behavior is described as \"violently hugging\" and even kissing her, which the daughter finds uncomfortable. The daughter has tried telling the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent's advice is to push back if the other child doesn't stop, using force only when necessary. The parent emphasizes that it's about self-defense in a situation where the other kid is forcing unwanted physical contact.\n\nNow, the key points are: the child's safety, the age of the kids (4 years old), and the appropriateness of teaching self-defense versus non-violence. The parent is trying to empower their daughter to protect herself in a situation where adults aren't effectively intervening. However, the partner argues that using any form of violence, even in self-defense, isn't appropriate for a young child and that reporting is the better option.\n\nI need to think about child development. At 4, children can understand basic concepts of personal space and boundaries. The parent is trying to teach her daughter to assess when she's in danger and respond accordingly. However, encouraging a child to push back might escalate the situation, especially if the other child is aggressive. But the parent is not teaching general aggression; it's specific to a situation where the other child is being violent despite the daughter's protests.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that their approach is consistent with their values against violence in general. So they're not promoting random violence but self-defense. The line here is thin. The question is whether the parent's advice is appropriate given the daughter's age and the circumstances.\n\nAnother angle: in some parenting philosophies, teaching children to stand up for themselves is important, but in others, non-violence is emphasized. The partner's concern might be that a 4-year-old might not have the judgment to distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate force. However, the parent is providing specific instructions\u2014only push back if the other child is being violent and won't stop, and to run and tell an adult if needed.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: The parent is trying to protect their child from unwelcome physical contact, which is a form of assault even in children. Teaching self-defense in such a case could be seen as reasonable. But the use of force by a child might have different implications than by an adult.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's approach is based on protecting their daughter's autonomy and safety when adults aren't effective. The partner's concern is valid, but the parent's advice is specific and context-driven. The parent isn't promoting general violence but situational self-defense. So, the answer might be that the parent isn't in the wrong (B), as they're addressing a specific threat and teaching a measured response.\n"
