Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is dealing with their 4-year-old daughter being hugged and kissed forcefully by another child. The daughter is uncomfortable and has told the teachers, but it's not stopping. The parent tells the daughter it's okay to push the kid away if he's hurting her and won't stop, and to push back or run away if the other kid reacts.\n\nThe question is whether the parent is wrong for encouraging this. The parent argues that it's about self-defense, teaching the child to protect herself in a situation where she's being violated. The spouse disagrees, thinking the child should rely on adults instead of using violence.\n\nFirst, considering the child's age. At 4, understanding boundaries and self-protection is a valid concern. The parent's approach is about immediate safety, teaching the child to assert herself physically when necessary. But there's a line between teaching self-defense and encouraging aggression. However, in cases of unwanted physical contact, especially when it's persistent and the child is distressed, allowing her to set physical boundaries might be reasonable.\n\nThe parent also mentions they are otherwise strict about not using violence. The scenario here is a specific case of defending against unwanted force. The parent is clarifying that it's okay to use force when someone is being violent towards their child. The key point is the justification of \"legit violence\"\u2014the child is defending herself against another's aggression.\n\nThe spouse's concern is valid too. Encouraging a child to push back could escalate the situation or teach aggression. However, if the child is being cornered and the adults aren't stopping it, giving the child tools to protect herself might be necessary. It's a balance between teaching non-violence and teaching self-defense.\n\nIn child-rearing, there's a debate between teaching children to avoid all conflict versus teaching them to protect themselves. Here, the parent is not promoting violence for fun but as a last resort when other measures (telling teachers) have failed. The parent's advice includes running away and telling an adult, which adds another layer of safety.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent is not in the wrong. They're addressing their child's immediate safety and teaching her to recognize and respond to inappropriate behavior. The spouse's approach relies on adults, but if adults aren't effective (teachers aren't seeing it), the child needs alternative strategies. The parent's advice is about empowering the child while still emphasizing non-violence in other contexts.\n"
