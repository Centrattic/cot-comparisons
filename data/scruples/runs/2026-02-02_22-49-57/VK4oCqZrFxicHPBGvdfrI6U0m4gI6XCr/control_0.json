  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for encouraging my 4y/o to push away another kid who keeps violently hugging her?\nJust had a fight with my SO because of what I told our daughter about \"legit violence\". Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a 4-year-old girl who's being hugged too hard and kissed by another kid at daycare. The parent told their daughter it's okay to push the kid away if he's being too forceful, even after she tells him to stop. The parent also suggested pushing back or running away and telling an adult if the other kid pushes back. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to just tell the teachers and not use any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is pretty young. At that age, kids are still learning how to handle social situations and boundaries. The parent is trying to teach their daughter to set boundaries, which is important. But teaching a 4-year-old to push back might be more complicated. Kids can get confused about when it's okay to use physical force. The parent mentions that they're usually against violence, which is a good point.\n\nOn one hand, the parent is responding to a situation where the other child isn't respecting their daughter's wishes, even after being told. That's a form of unwanted physical contact, which is a valid concern. Teaching the daughter that she can protect herself in that moment might be necessary. But on the other hand, encouraging physical retaliation could lead to more conflict or escalate the situation. The daycare teachers are supposed to manage these interactions, so maybe the parent should have focused more on ensuring the teachers are aware and handling it.\n\nThe spouse's argument is that the correct approach is to involve adults and avoid any violence. That makes sense because even at 4, using force can lead to unintended consequences. The child might not understand the difference between defending herself and starting a fight. Also, the daycare's responsibility includes managing these interactions, so maybe the parent should have placed more trust in the system.\n\nBut the parent did mention that the other child's parents are overprotective, which might mean that the daycare isn't handling it well. The daughter has already told the teachers, but the behavior continues. So the parent is trying to empower the child to take care of herself when adults aren't looking.\n\nI think the line here is between teaching self-defense in a controlled way versus encouraging aggression. The parent isn't telling the child to hit or hurt the other kid, just to push away, which is a more defensive action. However, for a 4-year-old, the distinction might not be clear. The parent's approach might be appropriate in teaching boundaries, but the spouse is concerned about normalizing violence, which is also valid.\n\nConsidering all this, I'm leaning towards the parent not being in the wrong. They're trying to protect their child in a situation where the other child isn't respecting boundaries. However, there's a valid concern about the method used and the child's age. Maybe a middle ground would be better, like teaching the child to say \"no\" firmly and immediately report it to a teacher each time, reinforcing that adults are there to help. But since the teachers aren't effective, the parent's approach is a response to that failure.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but there are valid points from both sides.\n"
