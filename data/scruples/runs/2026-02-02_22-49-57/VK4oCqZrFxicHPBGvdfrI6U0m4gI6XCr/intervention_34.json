Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push another child who's hugging her too hard and kissing her. The parent says the other child is aggressive and won't stop even when the daughter tells him to. The spouse thinks the parent is wrong because they should rely on teachers and avoid violence. The parent argues it's about using legitimate force in a violent situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 4 years old, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to handle conflicts. The daughter is already uncomfortable and has told the teachers without success. The parent is trying to teach her self-advocacy. But the spouse is concerned about encouraging violence. \n\nThe key points here are consent and safety. The other child is forcing physical contact, which is a form of non-consensual touch, even between kids. The parent is teaching their daughter to protect herself when the other child is not respecting her boundaries. However, the parent is careful to frame it as pushing away, not using violence, and emphasizes telling an adult if necessary. \n\nBut there's a concern about teaching young children to use physical force. At 4, kids might not fully understand how to apply appropriate force. The parent mentions the child might push back, so advising to push back or run away could escalate the situation. The spouse's point about relying on adults (teachers) makes sense because they're trained to handle such issues. However, if the teachers aren't effective, the parent is trying to give the child tools to protect herself.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, encouraging a child to use force is a tricky area. But it's also important to validate the child's feelings of discomfort and empower her to set boundaries. The parent isn't teaching aggression but self-defense in a specific context. However, the line between self-defense and violence can be blurry for young children. \n\nThe parent's approach might be appropriate given the circumstances, especially since the other child isn't respecting boundaries and the teachers haven't intervened. The parent is teaching the child to recognize when a situation is uncomfortable and to take action. Still, there's a balance to strike between empowering the child and ensuring they don't resort to aggression unnecessarily. \n\nAnother angle is the role of adults and communication. The parent might consider reinforcing the child's communication skills further, like using words more effectively or reporting the issue each time it happens. But since the teachers aren't seeing the incidents, the child might not get help that way. So the parent's advice could be a necessary backup.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's intention is to protect their child from being forced into physical contact, which is a valid concern. The advice given is specific to a situation where the other child is being aggressive. However, the parent needs to ensure the child understands the context and doesn't generalize this to all situations. The spouse's concern about teaching violence isn't entirely unfounded, but the parent's approach seems to be about self-protection rather than aggression. So while there are valid points on both sides, the parent's actions are aimed at protecting their child's well-being.\n"
