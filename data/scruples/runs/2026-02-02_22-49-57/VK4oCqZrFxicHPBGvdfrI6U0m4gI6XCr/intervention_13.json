Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push away another kid who's hugging her too hard and kissing her without consent. The parent says the kid doesn't stop even when the daughter tells him to, and the teachers aren't effective. The parent explains that if someone is hurting her, it's okay to push back, and even to use force if needed, like pushing back or running away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The parent's intention is to protect their child from unwanted physical contact. The daughter is 4 years old, which is very young, but the parent believes she's capable of understanding the difference between legitimate force (defending herself) and violence. The parent also emphasizes using force only when being hurt and then telling an adult. That seems like a good balance of safety and teaching self-defense.\n\nOn the other hand, the spouse argues that it's better to rely on teachers and avoid any violence. The concern here might be about the child learning that using force is acceptable, which could lead to more aggression in the future. Also, a 4-year-old might not have the judgment to discern when force is appropriate, leading to potential misuse.\n\nHowever, in this case, the situation is about someone else's child being physically aggressive, and the daughter is being harmed. The parent is trying to empower her to protect herself when adults aren't effective. The advice given is specific to a situation where the other child is being violent and not stopping when told. The parent isn't encouraging general violence but a specific response to being harmed.\n\nI think the key here is the context. The parent isn't teaching the child to start fights but to defend herself in a clear case of unwanted physical contact. Since the teachers aren't helping, the parent is trying to ensure their child knows how to stay safe. The advice includes both using force and then reporting it, which covers both immediate safety and long-term resolution.\n\nSo, the parent's approach seems reasonable given the circumstances. They're teaching the child necessary self-defense while emphasizing that it's only in response to direct harm. The spouse's concern is valid, but the parent's method is age-appropriate and specific to the situation. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
