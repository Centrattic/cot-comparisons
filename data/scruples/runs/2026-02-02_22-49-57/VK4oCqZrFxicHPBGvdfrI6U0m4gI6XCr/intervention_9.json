Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old daughter it's okay to push another kid who's hugging her too roughly. The situation involves a child who's being hugged forcefully and sometimes kissed by another child, and the parent is advising their daughter to push back if the other kid doesn't stop. The parent's spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to rely on teachers and avoid any violence. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The child is four years old, so her understanding of boundaries and self-defense is developing. The other child is also four, so it's not a bigger kid or someone threatening. The parent's advice is about using \"legit force\" when someone is being violent. They mention that the daughter has already told the teachers, but the teachers aren't seeing it happen, and the behavior continues. The parent is teaching their child to protect herself, but the spouse is concerned about encouraging violence.\n\nI should think about child development here. At four, kids often don't understand personal space as adults do, and they might not have the communication skills to stop someone. The parent is trying to teach her to assert her boundaries, which is important. But is pushing another kid considered violence? The parent argues it's necessary in self-defense when the other child is being violent. However, the spouse thinks it's better to avoid any physical response and rely on adults.\n\nAnother angle: the parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself when adults aren't able to intervene. But maybe there are better ways for a 4-year-old to handle this, like teaching her to say \"no\" more firmly, or moving away. However, the other child isn't stopping when the daughter yells, so the parent's solution might be a practical response given the child's age and the environment of the daycare.\n\nAlso, the daycare teachers aren't effective in stopping the behavior despite being informed. The parent might feel that the child needs to be able to protect herself in the absence of adult intervention. But is pushing appropriate? Maybe the parent should have discussed alternative strategies first, like using words or seeking immediate help. However, the daughter is already trying to tell the teachers without success.\n\nThe parent's advice is specific to a situation where the other child is being aggressive. The key here is whether the parent is teaching the child to respond in a way that's proportionate to the threat. Pushing back might escalate the situation, but if the other child is being overly forceful, it could be a way to stop the immediate discomfort.\n\nI think the parent is not in the wrong because they're trying to teach their child to protect herself in a situation where the existing measures (teachers) aren't working. The advice is about setting boundaries and using minimal force when necessary. The spouse's concern is valid, but the parent's approach is about immediate self-defense, not promoting violence. So the answer would be B.\n"
