Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another child who's hugging her too forcefully and kissing her without consent.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a young child being subjected to aggressive, non-consensual physical contact by another child. The parent's instruction is to use physical force as a last resort when the child is uncomfortable and the other child doesn't stop despite being told. The parent also mentions that the daycare teachers aren't effectively addressing the issue.\n\nI need to consider child development here. At 4 years old, children are learning about personal boundaries and how to communicate their needs. However, they might not have the physical strength or emotional maturity to handle conflicts on their own. The parent's advice includes using force, which could be seen as promoting violence, even if it's defensive. But the alternative is that the child continues to experience uncomfortable interactions without any effective intervention from adults.\n\nThe spouse argues that telling the teachers is better. But the parent states that the teachers aren't seeing the incidents, so the child can't rely on them for protection. The parent's approach is to empower the child to defend herself in a non-lethal way, like pushing away, which is a reasonable self-defense tactic for a young child. However, there's a risk that the child might escalate the situation or get hurt in the process.\n\nIs pushing considered \"violence\"? The parent differentiates between \"legit violence\" and teaching self-defense. Since the other child is initiating the non-consensual contact, the parent's instruction is about protecting the child from harm. But teaching a child to use physical force even in self-defense could set a precedent for aggressive behavior. However, the parent emphasizes that it's only in situations where the other child is being violent and not stopping.\n\nThe key points are: the child is being forced into uncomfortable physical contact, the teachers aren't effective, and the parent is trying to teach self-defense. The parent is not promoting random violence but specific actions in a specific context where the child's safety is at risk. The spouse's concern is valid about avoiding violence, but the parent's approach addresses an immediate problem that the system (daycare) isn't handling.\n\nIn terms of child psychology, teaching a child to assert their boundaries is important. The parent is helping the child understand that their feelings matter and that they can take action to protect themselves. However, the method involves physical action, which might be seen as inappropriate for a 4-year-old. But given the age and maturity, pushing away might be the only feasible way for the child to stop the other's actions immediately.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent might not be in the wrong because they're addressing a real issue with a practical solution given the circumstances. The answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong), but there are nuances. The parent could also be advised to explore other strategies, like role-playing how to say \"no\" or involving the daycare more effectively. But given the scenario, the parent's actions are aimed at protecting their child's well-being.\n"
