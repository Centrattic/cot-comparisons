Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is at fault for encouraging their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her in a way she finds uncomfortable. The parent explained that the child has tried telling the teachers, but it hasn't helped. The parent's advice was to push back if the other kid is being violent and not stopping. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to report and not use violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The child is very young, 4 years old. The other child is being forceful, even after the teachers have been told. The parent is trying to teach self-defense in a situation where the child is being physically overpowered. But the spouse is concerned about promoting violence.\n\nSo, what's the right approach here? At 4 years old, children are still learning social boundaries and how to express their discomfort. Encouraging physical resistance might be appropriate in some contexts, like self-defense, but could also lead to escalation. However, the parent is not teaching the child to hit or hurt the other kid, just to push away to stop the unwanted contact. The parent also mentioned that the child is aware of using force only when necessary and told to run and tell an adult if needed.\n\nBut there's a risk that pushing could be seen as aggressive, especially in kindergarten settings where teachers encourage non-violent conflict resolution. However, the other child is already being violent (forceful hugs, not stopping when told). So, is the parent's advice reasonable?\n\nAlso, the spouse's concern is valid because teaching a child to use physical force might not align with the school's policies or the parent's other teachings against violence. But the parent argues it's about legitimate defense. The key here is whether the parent is teaching self-defense or promoting aggression.\n\nIn many cases, experts recommend that children should be taught to use their voice first, then seek help. If that's not effective, maybe physical self-defense is a last resort. But for a 4-year-old, the ability to distinguish and apply such lessons might be limited. The parent might be overestimating the child's ability to handle this situation with the suggested methods.\n\nHowever, given that the other child isn't stopping and the teachers aren't catching it, the parent is trying to empower their daughter. It's a balance between teaching self-defense and maintaining non-violence. The parent isn't encouraging violence but rather a way to stop violence.\n\nSo, is the parent wrong? It's a tough call. Both perspectives have merit. The parent's approach might be reasonable in a situation where the child is being physically forced, but the spouse's concern about promoting violence is also valid. The answer could depend on cultural norms or specific parenting philosophies.\n\nIn the end, maybe the parent isn't entirely wrong because they are trying to protect their child from ongoing harmful behavior. However, relying on physical response might not be the best teaching moment. The better approach might be to reinforce communication with the teachers, but since that hasn't worked, the parent is taking a different route. The answer could be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that there's room for discussion on how to handle it.\n"
