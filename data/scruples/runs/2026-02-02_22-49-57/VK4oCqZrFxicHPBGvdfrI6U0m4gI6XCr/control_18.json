Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether they're in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old daughter to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her in a way she finds violent. The parent and their spouse are arguing about this, with the spouse advocating for only telling the teachers and not using any violence. The parent believes that the daughter is old enough to understand the difference between legitimate force for self-defense and using violence to hurt others. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. A 4-year-old is very young, and their ability to comprehend and execute self-defense actions might be limited. The parent's advice is to push the other kid if he's being too forceful, especially after the daughter expresses fear that he might push back. The parent adds that if that happens, she should push back again or run away and tell an adult. The spouse is concerned about encouraging violence in any form.\n\nThe key points here are about teaching a child to defend herself and the appropriateness of using physical force at that age. The daycare setting is important because it's a place where adults are supposed to manage such interactions. The daughter has already told the teachers, but the staff isn't catching it because it happens secretly. The parent might feel that the daughter needs to protect herself when adults aren't observing.\n\nHowever, teaching a child to respond with physical force could lead to escalation. The daycare's role is to intervene and teach appropriate social behavior. If the parent encourages the child to push back, the other kid might retaliate, leading to a cycle of violence. The spouse's concern is valid because introducing the concept of using force at such a young age might not be the best approach, especially in a controlled environment like daycare where adults should handle these situations.\n\nAlso, the concept of \"legitimate violence\" is tricky here. Even though the parent is emphasizing self-defense, the child might not fully grasp the concept of proportionality and when it's appropriate to use force. At 4 years old, the child's impulse control and judgment are still developing. The parent is trying to empower the child to set boundaries, which is good, but the method might not be suitable for her developmental stage.\n\nThe daycare staff might not have been proactive enough in addressing the issue. The parent's frustration is understandable, but the solution should ideally be handled by the adults in charge. Maybe the parent should have discussed the matter more with the daycare to find a structured solution rather than teaching the child to handle it physically. The spouse's suggestion to rely on adult intervention aligns with the daycare's responsibility to manage such behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is right in wanting to teach the child that she has the right to say no and protect herself. The advice given is to push away, not to hurt, which is a form of self-assertion rather than aggression. The parent's intention is to help the child feel safe and empowered, which is a positive goal. The challenge is whether a 4-year-old can differentiate between a forceful hug and actual violence, and whether pushing back is an effective, non-violent response.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is good, the approach might be inappropriate for a 4-year-old. The spouse is right to be cautious about promoting any form of violence, even if it's self-defense. The daycare should be more involved in addressing the behavior of the other child and ensuring that all interactions are safe and respectful. The parent should probably work with the daycare to reinforce boundaries and teach the daughter non-physical ways to express her discomfort, like using her voice more effectively or seeking immediate help from a teacher. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong by encouraging physical pushback instead of relying on adult supervision and non-violent communication methods.\n"
