Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her forcefully. The main issue here is how to handle a child being uncomfortable with another child's behavior, especially when the other child isn't stopping even after being told.\n\nFirst, the situation: The other kid is hugging and kissing the daughter in a way that's making her uncomfortable. The daughter has already told the teachers, but it's not working. The parent advises her to push back if she's being hurt or forced, which is physical intervention. The spouse disagrees, saying it's better to tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nNow, considering the child's age, 4 years old. At that age, a child might not have the physical strength or the ability to handle a confrontation effectively. Pushing back could escalate the situation, leading to more harm. Also, teaching a 4-year-old to respond to force with force might set a precedent for using physical violence in other situations, which isn't ideal.\n\nThe parent argues that it's \"legit force\" because the other child is being violent. However, in child interactions, even if the other child is acting out, the appropriate response for a 4-year-old is usually to seek help from an adult. The parent's approach might be trying to empower the child to protect herself, but the child's capacity to do so safely is questionable. The spouse's point about reporting to adults is more in line with standard advice for young children\u2014to avoid physical confrontation and instead use communication with adults.\n\nThere's also the aspect of teaching conflict resolution without violence. Even if the other child is acting inappropriately, the parent's advice might inadvertently model aggressive behavior. The child might not fully understand the difference between appropriate and inappropriate force, especially at four. The parent's solution could lead to a cycle where the other child retaliates, making the problem worse.\n\nAdditionally, the daycare teachers' role is to manage such situations. If they're not catching the behavior when they're present, maybe there's a need to address that. But the parent's approach bypasses that system, which could be problematic. The spouse's insistence on non-violence is in line with general child-rearing principles that emphasize non-physical conflict resolution, especially for young children.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the parent might be overstepping by encouraging physical intervention in a situation where the child isn't equipped to handle it safely. The spouse's approach, while perhaps not addressing the immediate discomfort, is more aligned with teaching non-violent solutions and seeking help from adults. Therefore, the parent could be in the wrong.\n"
