Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves a 4-year-old girl being hugged/kissed too forcefully by another kid who doesn't stop even when she yells. The parent told the daughter it's okay to push the other kid away if he's hurting her, and to push back or run away if he retaliates. The other parent disagrees, thinking she should just tell the teachers and avoid any violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. Four years old is very young, so their understanding of boundaries and how to handle situations might be limited. The parent is trying to teach her daughter to protect herself, which makes sense. But there's a balance between teaching self-defense and encouraging violence. \n\nThe other child's behavior is described as \"violently hugging\" and forced kisses, which the daughter finds uncomfortable. The daughter has already reported this to the teachers without success. The parent's approach is to allow defensive action if the other child is being violent. The other parent (SO) thinks that any form of violence should be avoided, even in response. \n\nIn some contexts, teaching a child to defend themselves when they're being physically harassed might be seen as necessary. However, using physical force could escalate the situation, especially with young children who might not understand boundaries. The parent is advising her daughter to push back, which could lead to more conflict. But on the other hand, if the child is being physically forced, teaching her to set boundaries might be important for her safety.\n\nI also need to consider the child's age and maturity. A 4-year-old might not have the judgment to distinguish between necessary defense and unnecessary aggression. The parent's advice is specific to situations where the other child is being violent, so it's a form of self-defense. However, the SO is concerned that any use of violence might lead to a cycle of aggression. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the daycare's role here. The parent mentioned that the teachers aren't effective in stopping the behavior, which adds pressure on the parent to find alternative solutions. The parent's solution is direct intervention, while the SO prefers relying on adults. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The parent is trying to empower their child to protect herself, which is a good intention. But the method involves physical force, which could have negative consequences. However, given the context of the other child's aggressive behavior, it's understandable. \n\nI think the key points are: the child is being physically forced in a way that's harmful, the parent is teaching specific defensive actions in those situations, and the child is old enough to understand the difference. The parent's advice isn't promoting general violence but self-defense. Therefore, the parent might not be in the wrong. But maybe there's a better way, like teaching the child to walk away or use words more effectively. However, since the other child isn't responding to words, the parent's approach is a practical, if not ideal, solution.\n"
