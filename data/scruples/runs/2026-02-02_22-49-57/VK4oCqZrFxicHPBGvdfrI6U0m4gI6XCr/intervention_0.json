Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for encouraging their 4-year-old to push another kid who's hugging and kissing her in a way that's making her uncomfortable. The parent had a conflict with their spouse over this advice. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The 4-year-old is in daycare, and there's another kid who's forcing hugs and kisses on her. The child has already told the teachers, but the behavior continues. The parent is advising the daughter to use force if the other kid won't stop, even though the daughter is worried the other kid might retaliate. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's wrong to use any violence and that the teachers should be told instead.\n\nNow, I have to analyze the ethics and common sense. At 4 years old, children are learning social boundaries and how to communicate. Pushing someone away is a form of physical self-defense, but teaching a 4-year-old to use force could have implications. On one hand, the parent is trying to protect their daughter by teaching her to assert herself in a situation where she feels uncomfortable. The other kid is using excessive force, so the parent is emphasizing that it's okay to use necessary force to stop it.\n\nBut then, the spouse is concerned that using any violence might not be the right approach. They might think that teaching a child to push back could escalate the situation or normalize physical responses. Also, daycare staff have a role in managing such interactions, so relying on them might be better. However, the parent mentioned that the teachers aren't able to catch the behavior because it happens when they're not around, and the other kid doesn't stop even when told. That's a tricky situation because the daycare might not be able to monitor all interactions, especially if they're not obvious.\n\nAnother angle is the child's emotional well-being. If the daughter is feeling threatened or uncomfortable, the parent is helping her understand that she can defend herself. But teaching a 4-year-old about pushing back could be seen as introducing aggression, even if it's in self-defense. It's a balance between teaching self-advocacy and avoiding violence.\n\nAlso, the daughter's response about the other kid pushing back or beating her is a concern. The parent's advice to push back again or run and tell an adult might be practical, but there's a risk that the child might not handle the physical confrontation safely. Maybe the parent should have focused more on non-physical ways to assert boundaries, like using words or moving away immediately, but the situation might require a quicker response.\n\nIn terms of legal or social norms, there's a concept of self-defense, but it's usually considered when there's imminent danger. Here, the child's discomfort might not rise to the level of legitimate violence, but the parent is using the term \"legit violence\" to justify the response. The parent is trying to make the daughter understand that it's okay to physically stop someone from causing her harm, even if it's another child.\n\nI should also think about the child's age. A 4-year-old might not fully grasp the concept of proportionality in force. The parent might be oversimplifying the issue, thinking that a gentle push is enough, but the other child could react more aggressively. It's possible that the daycare has policies against even minor physical altercations between kids, which the parent isn't considering.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is acknowledging that the other child's actions are violent (forceful hugs, not stopping when told), so they see it as a legitimate threat. The parent's advice is about using minimal force to stop the unwanted action, which could be justified. However, the spouse's concern is valid too. Encouraging a child to use physical force might lead to more conflicts or misunderstandings.\n\nThere's also the aspect of teaching the child to communicate. Maybe the parent could have reinforced that the daughter should clearly state \"no\" and seek help from adults, rather than using physical force. But given that the teachers aren't effective, the parent is stepping in to protect their child's well-being.\n\nSo, the core question is whether encouraging a 4-year-old to use physical force in this context is appropriate. The parent's intention is good, to protect their daughter from unwanted contact. But the method might be too direct for a child's developmental stage. The daycare's responsibility is to address such issues, so maybe the parents should focus on working with them more effectively rather than instructing the child to handle it alone. However, the parent is trying to empower the child, which is also a valid approach. It's a bit of a grey area. The answer might depend on cultural norms or specific parenting philosophies. But overall, the parent is trying to protect their child from harm, even if their method could be debated. So I'm leaning towards B, the parent isn't in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
