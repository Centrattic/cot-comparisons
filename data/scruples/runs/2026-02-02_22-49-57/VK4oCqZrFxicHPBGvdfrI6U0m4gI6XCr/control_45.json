Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for telling their 4-year-old to push away another kid who's hugging and kissing her too roughly. The parent's partner is upset because they think the child should just tell a teacher instead of using violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age. A 4-year-old is very young and might not have the emotional or physical control to handle such situations. The parent is teaching their daughter to use force if she feels uncomfortable, but maybe that's setting a precedent for using violence, which could be problematic. \n\nThen, the situation itself: the other child's behavior is inappropriate, especially the forced hugging and kissing. The teachers aren't effective in stopping it, so the parent wants to empower their daughter to protect herself. However, teaching a child to push back might encourage aggressive behavior, even if it's in self-defense. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent argues it's about \"legit violence,\" meaning defending oneself when someone else is being violent. The daughter was already trying to tell the teachers but it didn't work. The parent's approach could be seen as teaching necessary self-defense, but at such a young age, it's tricky. The daughter's fear of retaliation (\"he might push back\") shows she's aware of the potential consequences, which the parent acknowledges by suggesting to push back or run away. \n\nBut the partner's concern is valid too. For a 4-year-old, relying on teachers is part of social learning. Teaching kids to report issues rather than escalate them is generally recommended. Using physical force, even minimal, might lead to more conflict or negative behaviors. Also, the child might not understand the difference between self-defense and aggression at that age.\n\nSo, the parent's intention is protective, but the method might not be appropriate for a 4-year-old. The answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong because they're promoting physical confrontation in a situation that should be addressed through communication and authority figures.\n"
