Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for advising their 4-year-old to push away another child who's forcefully hugging and kissing her. The parent's spouse thinks they should avoid violence entirely and report it to teachers, while the parent argues that their daughter needs to defend herself when the other child isn't stopping despite being told.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age. At four, kids are still learning social boundaries and how to express discomfort. The situation involves a child who's being physically uncomfortable with another child's actions. The parent is teaching their daughter to use \"legit force\" to stop unwanted physical contact. But is teaching a 4-year-old to push someone back appropriate?\n\nOn one hand, the parent is trying to empower their daughter to assert her boundaries, which is a good thing. It's important for children to know their bodies are their own and to feel safe saying no. However, the method here is physical pushing, which could escalate the situation. The parent also mentions that the other child might push back, so suggesting to push back again could lead to a cycle of physical conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the spouse's concern is valid. Teaching non-violence and relying on adults is a standard approach in many child-rearing practices. At 4 years old, kids might not have the judgment to discern when force is appropriate and when it's not. Even if the parent thinks the child can tell the difference, a young child's ability to de-escalate a situation might not be mature enough. \n\nThe daycare teachers aren't handling it effectively, which is a problem. The parent should probably work with the daycare to address the issue more systematically, maybe through talking to the other child's parents or the daycare's policies. However, the parent's intention to protect their daughter is understandable. \n\nBut encouraging a 4-year-old to use physical force might not be the best approach. It could normalize violence as a solution, even if it's meant to be defensive. The child might not have the emotional maturity to handle the consequences, like guilt or fear, and could end up in a worse situation if the other child retaliates. \n\nIn terms of child development, experts often recommend teaching children to use words, seek adult help, or move away from uncomfortable situations. Physical intervention is usually a last resort and should be guided by adults. The parent's advice might be well-intentioned, but the approach could be problematic given the child's age and the potential for escalation. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be that the parent is in the wrong (A) because teaching a young child to use physical force to resolve such situations isn't the recommended approach. They should focus on non-violent solutions and better communication with the daycare to address the root cause.\n"
