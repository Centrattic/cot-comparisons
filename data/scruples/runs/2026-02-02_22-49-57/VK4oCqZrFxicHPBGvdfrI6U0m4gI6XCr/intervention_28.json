Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their 4-year-old daughter being in a daycare where another kid is hugging her and kissing her too forcefully, sometimes even after she yells for him to stop. The parent told their daughter it's okay to push him away if he won't stop, and to push back or run away if he retaliates. The spouse disagrees, thinking it's better to just tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age and the situation. A 4-year-old might not have the physical strength or the emotional maturity to handle a physical confrontation. Encouraging a child to push back could escalate the situation, leading to more harm, especially if the other child is bigger or stronger. Also, teaching a 4-year-old about using force in such situations might not be appropriate. At that age, children are still learning how to communicate their feelings and seek help from adults.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the daycare's role. The parent mentioned that the teachers are sometimes aware but don't see it happen. It might be that the daycare needs better supervision or intervention strategies. The parent's approach could undermine the daycare's responsibility to manage such interactions. If the parent is teaching the child to handle it physically, it might not be the best long-term solution. The spouse's argument to involve adults more is about ensuring the child learns to seek help through appropriate channels.\n\nAlso, the concept of \"legit violence\" is a bit tricky here. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself, which is a valid concern. However, the method of pushing back might not be age-appropriate. The child might not understand the boundaries of appropriate force and could end up in a more dangerous situation. It's important to balance teaching self-defense with teaching communication and seeking help.\n\nAnother angle is the psychological impact on the child. If the daughter hears she can push back, she might feel more confident, but if things go wrong, it could lead to anxiety or fear. The parent's approach might give the child a sense of agency, but if the spouse is right, it could lead to more problems. The daycare environment is supposed to be a safe space where children learn social skills, so the parent's intervention might be seen as overstepping, especially if the daycare isn't handling the issue adequately.\n\nThe spouse's perspective emphasizes non-violence and trusting adults, which is common in parenting approaches. However, the parent's concern is valid: if the daycare isn't addressing the issue, the child needs some way to protect herself. There's a middle ground here. Maybe the parent should have discussed with the daycare first to find a better solution rather than teaching the child to push back. Alternatively, they could work with the daycare to address the other child's behavior more effectively.\n\nIn terms of societal or cultural norms, there's a debate about when it's appropriate to teach children to defend themselves. Some might argue that it's better to empower the child, while others believe that involving adults is the safer route. The key here is the age of the child and the effectiveness of the solution. At 4 years old, the child might not have the judgment to assess when force is necessary or how to apply it without causing harm.\n\nConsidering all these points, the parent's intention is to protect their child, but the method might not be the most effective or safe for a 4-year-old. The spouse's approach of relying on adults to handle the situation is more in line with typical parenting advice for that age group. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for encouraging physical confrontation instead of focusing on communication and adult intervention.\n"
