Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent who encouraged their 4-year-old to push away another kid is in the wrong. The situation is that the other child is hugging and kissing her too forcefully, and the daughter tried telling the teachers but it didn't stop. The parent advised her to push back if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The child is being physically uncomfortable with another kid's actions. The parent is teaching her to defend herself when the other child won't stop. The parent isn't advocating for violence in general but specific situations where someone is being violent towards her. The spouse thinks the parent is wrong for suggesting any form of violence, even if it's defensive.\n\nI should think about child safety. At 4 years old, a child might not have the physical strength to defend themselves effectively. Encouraging push back could lead to escalation. Also, teaching children to use physical force might not be the best approach, especially in a childcare setting where supervision is expected. Teachers and adults should handle such situations to ensure the safety of both children.\n\nHowever, the parent's intention is to teach their child to recognize when their boundaries are being crossed and to take some action if adults aren't intervening. The parent is trying to empower the child to protect herself, which is a valid concern. But the method might not be the best. Instead of physical push back, maybe teaching the child to tell an adult immediately, or to use words to set boundaries more clearly.\n\nAnother angle is that the parent is teaching the child self-defense, which is a necessary skill in some situations. But for a 4-year-old, this could be confusing. They might not understand the difference between appropriate force and aggression. Also, the other child might feel hurt or retaliate, leading to more conflict.\n\nThe spouse is concerned about the use of any violence, which is understandable. Schools and daycares usually have protocols for handling such issues, and relying on the child to resolve it through physical means might not align with those protocols. The parent's approach could also set a precedent for using physical force in other situations, which might not be desirable.\n\nIn terms of legality or ethics, teaching a child to use force to defend themselves isn't inherently wrong, but the appropriateness depends on the situation and the child's age. Since the child is very young, perhaps the parent should focus on communication and reporting to adults rather than physical intervention. The parent might be in the right in intention but the method could be flawed.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent's advice might be well-meaning but not the best approach for a 4-year-old. The answer might lean towards A (the parent is in the wrong) because encouraging physical retaliation could lead to negative outcomes and might not be effective. However, the parent's concern about the child's safety is valid. The spouse's point about reporting is also important. The correct approach could be a balance between teaching the child to assert boundaries and ensuring they know to immediately tell an adult if the behavior continues.\n"
