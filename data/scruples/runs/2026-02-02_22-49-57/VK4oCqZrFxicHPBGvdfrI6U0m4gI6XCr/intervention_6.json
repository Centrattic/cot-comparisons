Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the situation. The parent is asking if they're at fault for teaching their 4-year-old to push away another child who's hugging and kissing her too forcefully. The other kid isn't stopping even when the daughter tells him to, and the teachers aren't catching it. The parent's partner disagrees, saying it's better to just tell the teachers and avoid violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's age. At 4, children are still learning social boundaries and how to express their feelings. The daughter is already trying to tell the other kid to stop, but he's not responding. The parent is teaching the daughter to use \"legit force\" if the other child won't stop, which in this context seems to be pushing away. The parent is emphasizing self-defense and safety, which is a common approach when a child is being physically uncomfortable or harassed.\n\nHowever, the partner argues that even in self-defense, using force shouldn't be encouraged. The question is whether the parent is wrong for teaching this. It's a balance between teaching a child to protect themselves and avoiding promoting violence. The key here is the context\u2014this isn't about fighting; it's about stopping unwanted physical contact. The parent is teaching the child to act when necessary to stop violence, not to initiate it. Also, the parent mentions the child should run away or tell an adult if things escalate, which adds another layer of safety.\n\nAnother angle is the daycare's role. The teachers aren't responding adequately, so maybe the parent is trying to fill that gap. But should the parent take over from the teachers? The parent might feel they need to step in because the system isn't working. However, there's a line where parents might overstep or not trust the daycare's methods. But given the situation, the child's immediate safety is a concern.\n\nI remember reading that children should be taught to say \"no\" and to remove themselves from uncomfortable situations. Physical force is generally discouraged unless it's to prevent harm. But in cases where a child is being physically forced, some experts might say it's okay to use minimal force to stop it. The key is whether the force is reasonable and necessary. Pushing away might be considered a reasonable response to stop unwanted forceful contact.\n\nAlso, the daughter is old enough to understand the difference between defensive actions and violence. The parent isn't encouraging aggression but teaching self-defense. The partner's concern is valid, but the parent is addressing a real issue where the child is being physically uncomfortable. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent is trying to protect their child from an ongoing issue that the daycare isn't handling properly. Teaching the child to defend herself in a specific, non-aggressive way might be justified here. So the answer would be B, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
