In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a group project during a Master's program. The user is asking if they were right to embarrass their classmate Barbara, who didn't do her part and made their group cry.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. Barbara previously didn't contribute much. Last time, she took credit for the author's work and didn't add her own efforts. Now, Barbara was supposed to handle the most important part of the task again but didn't do it. The author overheard her talking to someone else about not finding anything, then called her out in front of the group, leading her to cry.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent. They admit they wanted Barbara to have to admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone. That sounds like retaliation for past behavior. The question is whether that's justified. \n\nIn academic settings, group work often relies on cooperation and trust. If Barbara consistently underperforms and takes credit, that's on her. However, the author's response was to embarrass her publicly, which can be seen as harsh. While Barbara's actions were poor, making her cry and exposing her in front of others might cross a line. The author could have addressed it privately or through the group leader instead of publicly shaming her. \n\nAlso, contributing to a hostile environment or causing emotional distress, even if someone is at fault, isn't typically seen as acceptable. There might be a better way to handle it, like discussing with the instructor or addressing it without public humiliation. \n\nSo, while Barbara is clearly at fault for not doing her work, the author's method of confronting her could be considered inappropriate. The intention was to get her to admit failure publicly, which is more about revenge than a constructive approach. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled the situation.\n"
