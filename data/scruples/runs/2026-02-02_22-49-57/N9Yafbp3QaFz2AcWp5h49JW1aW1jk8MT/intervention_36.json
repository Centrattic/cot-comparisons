In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a group project where the author and Barbara are working together. The author has a past experience with Barbara where Barbara took credit for the author's work and didn't contribute. Now, in this new project, Barbara volunteered for the most important task but didn't do any work. The author, knowing Barbara didn't do the work, called her out in front of the group, leading Barbara to cry.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they wanted Barbara to admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by embarrassing Barbara. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a bad history with Barbara, where she didn't contribute and took credit. This time, Barbara chose the big task but didn't do it. The group leader was already prompting people to share, and Barbara was silent. The author's action was to point out Barbara's lack of contribution.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified because of Barbara's past behavior. They might want to prevent her from taking credit again. But on the other hand, confronting someone in a public setting, leading them to cry, could be seen as harsh, especially if the author knew she was going to be upset. \n\nIs there a better way to handle it? Maybe talking to Barbara privately first? But the author might not trust her based on past experience. Also, the group leader was already involved, and the author might be trying to hold everyone accountable. \n\nIt's a bit of a dilemma. The author's intent was to ensure that Barbara's lack of work was addressed, but the method caused emotional harm. Depending on the perspective, the author could be seen as standing up for fairness or as being vindictive due to past issues. \n\nIn academic settings, collaboration and accountability are important. However, public shaming isn't typically encouraged. Even though Barbara didn't do the work, the way the author handled it might have been too harsh. The author might have had reasons to be upset, but making her cry in front of others could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nSo, considering the intent vs. the action, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault, but the method was inappropriate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the situation, there's a case for both sides. But since the author knew Barbara had done nothing and deliberately made her admit it publicly, it's possible the author's actions were vindictive, even if they had a prior grievance. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because the approach was unkind and public, even if there were valid reasons. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the intent was fair accountability. But I think the key is that the author's method was harmful, so A might be the answer.\n"
