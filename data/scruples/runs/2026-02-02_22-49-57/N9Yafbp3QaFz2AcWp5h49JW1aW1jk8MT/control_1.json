In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post (AITA) is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a group project where the author had a bad experience with Barbara in a previous assignment. Barbara didn't contribute much, took credit for the author's work, and didn't even mention her irrelevant research. Now, in a new group, Barbara volunteered for the most important part of the task but didn't do it. The author knew she hadn't done anything and called her out, leading Barbara to cry.\n\nThe key points here are the author's motivation. The author mentions that they wanted Barbara to admit she hadn't done the work in front of everyone. That's a bit shady because it's intentional embarrassment. Even if Barbara is at fault for not doing her part, the author's approach was to humiliate her, which is pretty harsh. \n\nGroup work dynamics can be tricky. While holding people accountable is important, doing so in a way that makes someone cry seems excessive. The author's previous bad experience might have fueled their reaction, but that doesn't justify making Barbara the target of public shaming. \n\nAlso, the author overheard Barbara talking to a classmate about not finding anything, so they knew she hadn't contributed. Instead of privately addressing it or working around her lack of effort, they chose to confront her in front of others. That's where the problem lies. Maybe a more constructive approach would have been to let the group leader handle it or to support Barbara to do better next time without public humiliation.\n\nBarbara did volunteer for the task, so she's responsible for her part. But the author's method of confronting her was unnecessarily harsh. Intentions matter here\u2014seeking retaliation or public shaming isn't fair. Even if Barbara is at fault, the author's actions were mean-spirited and unkind, which makes them at least partially responsible for Barbara's emotional response.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because they intentionally embarrassed Barbara instead of handling the situation more privately and constructively. The answer should be A.\n"
