In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara. I need to break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and Barbara are in a group project for their master's. In a previous instance, Barbara relied on someone else's work and took credit. Now, Barbara volunteered for a big part of the current project but didn't do it. The author noticed she wasn't contributing and called her out in front of everyone, leading Barbara to cry.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author has a history with Barbara where Barbara didn't contribute and took credit. This time, Barbara again didn't do her part, and the author exposed her in public. The question is about whether the author is at fault.\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid reasons. Barbara didn't do the work, and there's a past issue. The author might feel justified in holding her accountable, especially after the previous betrayal. The group might need everyone's input, so the author is trying to ensure Barbara's part is addressed.\n\nOn the other hand, calling someone out publicly can be harsh. Even if Barbara deserved it, making her cry seems extreme. The author knew Barbara hadn't done the work beforehand and chose to confront her in front of everyone, which could be seen as intentionally embarrassing her. That's not just pointing out the issue but doing it in a way that's hurtful.\n\nAlso, considering teamwork dynamics, there might be better ways to handle this. Maybe discussing privately first, or working with the group leader to address the issue without public shaming. The author's approach might have been vindictive rather than constructive, especially given the past experience. But Barbara's actions were unethical and unprofessional, so the author is trying to prevent her from taking credit again.\n\nIt's a tough balance. The author has a right to be upset, but the method of confrontation might be the problem. Public shaming can damage group cohesion and isn't a professional way to handle things. However, Barbara's behavior was also problematic, and the author might feel they needed to take action to ensure the project's success.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if we're judging from a moral standpoint, even if the author had valid reasons, intentionally embarrassing someone to make them admit they failed could be seen as inconsiderate. Empathy and handling it more privately might have been better. So the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if the underlying issue with Barbara was real.\n"
