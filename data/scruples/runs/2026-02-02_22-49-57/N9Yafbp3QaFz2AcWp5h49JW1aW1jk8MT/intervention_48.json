In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a group presentation for a Masters program. The user is in a group and had a past experience where their classmate, Barbara, didn't contribute properly. Last time, Barbara got someone else to do the work and then took credit for it. Now, in a new group task, Barbara volunteered for the most important question but didn't do any research. The group leader was asking for feedback, and Barbara stayed silent. The author, knowing she hadn't done anything, asked her a question in front of everyone, making her cry.\n\nHmm, the user is asking if they were at fault for embarrassing Barbara. The user's reasoning is that Barbara didn't do her work before and now again, so they wanted her to face the consequences in front of others. But is that the right approach?\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of group work, especially in academic settings. Group tasks often require collaboration, and when someone doesn't contribute, it can be frustrating. The author's past experience with Barbara probably built up some resentment. This time, Barbara took on a big part but didn't follow through. The author overheard her saying she couldn't find anything, so they knew she wasn't going to contribute. \n\nBut when the author asked Barbara the question, it led to her breaking down. The key issue here is whether the author's intent was to embarrass her or to get the necessary information from the group. The author says they wanted her to admit in front of everyone that she didn't do the work. That sounds like a punitive action rather than a constructive one. \n\nIn academic groups, the goal is usually to complete the task successfully. If Barbara wasn't contributing, the appropriate approach might have been to address it privately or involve the group leader to handle it, rather than publicly shaming her. Even though Barbara had a history of not pulling her weight, confronting her in front of everyone could have been harsh and potentially unkind. \n\nHowever, the author might feel justified because Barbara's inaction affects the whole group's performance. If the group is supposed to rely on each member's research, then her silence could compromise the project. The author's action might be seen as trying to hold her accountable. But making her cry is a strong reaction, which could indicate that the approach was too aggressive. \n\nIs there a balance between accountability and empathy? The user's action might have been about ensuring that Barbara's part was covered, but the method\u2014calling her out directly in a public setting\u2014could be seen as the wrong approach. Even if Barbara deserved it, the emotional impact on her might have been too much. \n\nAlso, considering the group's role, maybe the leader should have handled the situation. The author's motivation to prevent her from taking credit again is understandable, but public confrontation might not be the best way. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, it's possible that the author acted out of spite rather than a genuine desire to help the group. Publicly embarrassing someone, even if they've done something wrong before, isn't typically considered the right approach unless there's a clear reason to do so. \n\nBut I need to weigh the intent. The author's intent was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work, which could be seen as a way to prevent her from hiding again. However, the method was confrontational and caused emotional distress. \n\nI think the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because while Barbara's actions were problematic, the way the author addressed it was unkind and public, which isn't the best approach. Holding someone accountable should be done with consideration for their well-being and through appropriate channels. The author's action, though possibly motivated by past grievances, was not constructive and may have been malicious.\n"
