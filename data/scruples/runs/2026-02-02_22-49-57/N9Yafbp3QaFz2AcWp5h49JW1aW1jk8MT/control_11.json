In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a group project where the author embarrassed a classmate, Barbara, by making her cry in front of everyone. The user is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The author mentions a past incident where Barbara didn't contribute, took credit for their work, and now this time Barbara volunteered for the most important part but didn't do it. The author overheard her talking about not finding anything, then called her out in front of the group, leading to Barbara crying.\n\nSo, the key points here are: past bad behavior by Barbara, the author's intent to make Barbara admit she didn't work, and the emotional response of Barbara. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's intention was to confront Barbara for her past actions and ensure accountability, maybe they think it's justified. But maybe it's not the right way to handle it. Public shaming can be harmful, even if the person being shamed has done wrong before. The author might be right in feeling frustrated, but making someone cry publicly is a strong reaction. \n\nAlso, considering the group work context, maybe the author should have addressed it privately instead of in front of everyone. Even if Barbara didn't do the work, calling her out publicly could damage team dynamics and her credibility. However, Barbara did volunteer for the task and then didn't follow through, so there's a responsibility there too.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author had the right to make her admit it publicly. Maybe there's a better approach, like discussing with the group leader or addressing it privately. The author might be justified in wanting to hold Barbara accountable, but the method used was harsh. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because there's a valid reason to confront someone who didn't do their work, especially after past issues. But others might argue that public humiliation is never okay, regardless of the situation. But given the context, the author's actions could be seen as a justified response to Barbara's repeated slacking, even if the method was harsh. However, the intention was to make her admit it publicly, which is manipulative. So there's a conflict here between accountability and the method used. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong (A) because they intentionally set up Barbara to embarrass her, which is not fair regardless of past behavior. Even if Barbara did wrong before, making her cry in front of others is crossing a line. The right approach would be to address the issue privately or through proper channels, not public shaming. \n\nSo I need to decide between A and B. The key is whether the author's action was justified. If the author's intent was to hold Barbara accountable, but the method was inappropriate, then maybe A. But if the action was a fair consequence, then B. The line here is between public shaming vs. addressing the issue. Since the author knew Barbara hadn't done the work and called her out in a way that made her cry, that's probably not acceptable. Even if Barbara is at fault, the author's method is wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
