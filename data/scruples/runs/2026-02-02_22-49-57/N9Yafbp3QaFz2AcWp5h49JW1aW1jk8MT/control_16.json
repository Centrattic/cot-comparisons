In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate. The situation involves a group project where Barbara didn't do her part before and now again, and the author called her out, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Barbara had a history of not contributing and taking credit last time. This time, she volunteered for the biggest question but didn't do the work. The author noticed she was being quiet and overheard her saying she couldn't find anything. Then, the author asked her directly in front of everyone, making her cry.\n\nSo, was the author wrong? On one hand, Barbara's past behavior might justify the author's actions. She didn't contribute before and now again. The author might have felt frustrated and wanted to hold her accountable. But on the other hand, publicly shaming someone, especially leading them to cry, could be seen as harsh. Even if Barbara didn't do the work, the author's approach might have been unnecessary. Maybe a more private approach would have been better to address the issue without embarrassing her in front of everyone. The author intended to make her admit she didn't do the work, which could be seen as seeking revenge for the previous incident. That might make the author's actions more about personal satisfaction than constructive problem-solving.\n\nHowever, considering Barbara's pattern, the author might feel justified in trying to prevent her from taking credit again. But making her cry in front of others is a significant consequence. It's possible that the author overstepped, even if Barbara was at fault. The question is whether the method used was appropriate. In academic settings, collaboration and handling conflicts professionally are expected. Public humiliation might not be the right approach, even if the person is at fault. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for the method used, despite Barbara's actions.\n"
