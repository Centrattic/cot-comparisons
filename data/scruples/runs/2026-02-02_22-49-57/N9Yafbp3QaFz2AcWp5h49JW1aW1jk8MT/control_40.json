In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a classmate named Barbara who didn't do her part in a group work in the past and took credit for the writer's work. Now, Barbara was supposed to research the most important question in the latest group project but didn't do it. The writer then publicly called her out in front of the group, leading Barbara to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer had a bad experience before with Barbara, so there's some history of unfairness and taking credit. Barbara's behavior this time is similar\u2014she didn't contribute and was trying to stay silent. The writer's intention was to make her admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone. \n\nIs the writer in the wrong for embarrassing Barbara? Well, the writer's actions were intentional to expose Barbara's lack of contribution. However, the method used was public embarrassment, which can be harsh. But given Barbara's past behavior, maybe the writer felt justified. \n\nOn one hand, the writer might have a point in holding Barbara accountable, especially after previous issues. Group work requires contribution, and if someone isn't doing their part, it's fair to address it. But doing it in a way that makes Barbara cry could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nOn the other hand, public shaming can be unkind and counterproductive. The writer could have addressed the issue privately instead of in front of everyone. However, the writer might not have known Barbara's personal struggles or reasons for not completing the work. Even if Barbara had valid reasons, the writer's approach was harsh. \n\nThe key factors here are intention and impact. The writer intended to hold Barbara accountable but caused emotional distress. While Barbara's actions were negligent, the writer's method of addressing it was confrontational in a public setting. \n\nIn academic settings, collaboration is important, and addressing issues directly is part of that. However, the manner in which it's done affects team dynamics and personal relationships. The writer might not be entirely in the wrong because Barbara's past and present behavior were problematic. But the approach taken could have been more constructive. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer leans towards the writer not being in the wrong (B) because the situation involved repeated issues with Barbara. However, there's room to argue that the approach was too harsh. The community's response might be mixed, but given the history and the writer's intention to ensure accountability, B might be the right choice.\n"
