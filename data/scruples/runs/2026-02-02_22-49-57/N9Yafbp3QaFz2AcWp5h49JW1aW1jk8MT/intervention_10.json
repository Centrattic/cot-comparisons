In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The user is part of a group project where they split tasks, and Barbara, their classmate, previously didn't contribute much. Last time, she emails her tutor and gets a guidance sheet, which wasn't really relevant, and then took credit for the user's work. This time, Barbara took on the biggest question but didn't do any research. The user noticed she wasn't contributing, overheard her saying she couldn't find anything, and then called her out in front of the group, leading her to cry.\n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong. They argue that Barbara's past behavior justifies their actions, but maybe they're being harsh. Let me think about the dynamics here. The user wanted to expose Barbara's lack of effort because of her previous actions. But is publicly humiliating someone the right approach?\n\nOn one hand, the user might feel justified because Barbara didn't do her part and took credit before. But public embarrassment can be hurtful and counterproductive. It might create a hostile environment. The user's intention was to make Barbara admit her failure in front of everyone, which could be seen as seeking revenge or attention. However, the user could have approached Barbara privately first, maybe to address the issue without involving the whole group. \n\nBut given Barbara's past behavior, maybe the user thought a public call-out was necessary to prevent her from taking credit again. However, making her cry seems extreme. The user might have overstepped by not giving Barbara a chance to explain or by using a confrontational approach. \n\nAnother angle: group projects often require collaboration, and if someone isn't contributing, it's better to address it constructively. The user's method of addressing it might have been inappropriate even if the issue needed to be raised. The user's past experience with Barbara might have clouded their judgment, leading to an aggressive response. \n\nAlso, the user overheard Barbara saying she couldn't find anything, which suggests she wasn't avoiding the task entirely but was struggling. Publicly calling her out might not encourage her to do better in the future and could damage group dynamics. \n\nIn conclusion, while Barbara did not contribute, the user's method of addressing it might be considered in the wrong because it led to emotional distress without a constructive approach. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I'm not entirely sure. Some might say the user had a valid reason given Barbara's past actions. It's a tough call between justified action and poor handling of the situation.\n"
