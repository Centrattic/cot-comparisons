In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is at fault for embarrassing their classmate Barbara. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: They're in a graduate program doing group work. The setup is that they split into groups to prepare presentations, with each session having different phases. In this case, Barbara was assigned a major part of the problem to research, based on her volunteering. The user has a history with Barbara where she previously didn't contribute much, just sent an email to a tutor, and then took credit for the user's work.\n\nNow, in the current scenario, Barbara didn't contribute during the discussion and was quiet. The user, knowing Barbara had done nothing (because they overheard her talking to a classmate), called her out in front of the group, prompting her to cry. The user's intention was to force her to admit she hadn't done the work, publicly.\n\nHmm. So the user is justified because Barbara didn't do her part before, and this time she didn't do it again. But the user's method was to embarrass her in front of everyone. Even though Barbara might be at fault for not contributing, the user's approach was to humiliate her, which is unkind. But considering Barbara's past behavior, maybe the user felt it was necessary to hold her accountable. However, group work in academia can be tricky. If the user had approached Barbara privately first, maybe they could have addressed the issue without public embarrassment. By doing it publicly, even if Barbara deserved it, the user caused emotional distress. \n\nBut wait, the user might have thought that Barbara would avoid responsibility if not called out. Also, the group leader was already prompting people to speak up, so the user's question wasn't entirely out of line\u2014it was just timed in a way that caught Barbara off guard. The key points here are the past transgressions of Barbara and the method the user chose to address it. The user's actions might be seen as justified in a way to prevent Barbara from getting away with not doing her share, but the public nature of it is where the problem lies. Academic settings require collaboration, and public shaming can damage relationships and trust. However, if Barbara's behavior is a pattern of freeloading, the user might feel compelled to act. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the user is protecting their own interests and ensuring accountability. On the other hand, the method used was harsh and unkind. The user's intention was to make Barbara admit her failure publicly, which might have been a way to prevent her from taking credit again. But causing someone to cry is a significant emotional response. The question is whether the means justify the ends. If the user had a private conversation first, that might have been more appropriate. But given the group setting and the leader's prompts, maybe the user felt it was the only way. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the approach taken. Publicly embarrassing someone, even if they've wronged you before, is generally seen as unkind and counterproductive. However, in an academic environment where collaboration is key, the user might have a point in trying to hold Barbara accountable. But the method of doing so in a public setting, leading to tears, suggests that the user's approach was not appropriate. So, the user might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, despite the valid reasons.\n"
