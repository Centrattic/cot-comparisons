In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a group project where the author, let's call them \"Person A,\" is dealing with a classmate named Barbara. \n\nFirst, the background: In a previous project, Barbara didn't contribute much. She asked a tutor for help, got a guidance sheet, but didn't really use it. Then, when presenting, Barbara took credit for Person A's work. That's pretty bad, right? So Person A is probably frustrated with Barbara's history of not pulling her weight.\n\nNow, in the current scenario, Barbara volunteers for the most important part of the task. But during the feedback session, she's silent. The group leader asks if everyone has contributed, and Barbara stays quiet. Person A overhears Barbara telling someone else she found nothing. Then, Person A publicly calls out Barbara, leading her to cry. The question is whether Person A is in the wrong for embarrassing Barbara.\n\nSo, what are the key points here? Person A's motivation is revenge or ensuring accountability. But did they overstep by making Barbara cry? Publicly shaming someone, even if they're at fault, can be harmful. But Barbara did volunteer for a critical part and failed, so maybe she's responsible. However, the method Person A used was to make her admit in front of everyone, which might be harsh. \n\nThe ethical angle here is tricky. On one hand, Barbara's actions in the past were dishonest and unfair. On the other, retaliating by embarrassing her in front of others could be seen as unkind. But Person A might feel justified given Barbara's previous behavior. However, the outcome was emotional distress, which is a negative consequence. \n\nIs there a better way Person A could have handled it? Maybe confronting Barbara privately first? But in the situation, the group was waiting for contributions, and Barbara was avoiding it. Person A's intention might have been to hold Barbara accountable, but the public nature of the call-out caused harm. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have issues. Barbara didn't do her part, but Person A's response led to emotional harm. The question is whether the public shaming was warranted. Some might argue that in a team setting, accountability is necessary, but the method matters. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the public embarrassment was the right approach. Even if Barbara is at fault, the way Person A handled it was harsh. So maybe Person A is partially in the wrong. But others might say that Barbara's actions justified the response. Hmm. The problem is that while Barbara's actions were bad, the public shaming might not be the appropriate way to address it. So maybe the answer is that Person A is in the wrong because they chose a method that caused emotional harm, even if their intent was to address Barbara's negligence.\n"
