In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: They're in a Master's program, group work every two weeks. The setup is that in session one, they discuss and split up tasks, then in session two, they present their research. Barbara volunteered for the biggest question this time. \n\nThe author has a history with Barbara. Last time, Barbara didn't contribute much\u2014she just asked the tutor for a sheet, and then took credit for the author's work. Now, in the current session, Barbara didn't contribute during the feedback. The author noticed she wasn't speaking up, and even overheard her saying she found nothing. Then the author called her out in front of the group, leading Barbara to cry.\n\nThe author's intention was to make her admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone. The key points here are the author's motivation and the action taken. \n\nOn one hand, Barbara had a bad track record, and the author might feel justified in holding her accountable. But on the other hand, calling someone out in a public setting that leads them to cry could be seen as harsh. The author might be seeking revenge for the previous incident, which complicates things. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, while Barbara's behavior was problematic, the way the author handled it\u2014intentionally embarrassing her\u2014might not be the right approach. Instead of confronting her privately, they chose to do it publicly, which could be seen as mean-spirited, even if there's a history. \n\nBut maybe the group work context requires accountability, and the author felt responsible to point out the lack of contribution. However, making someone cry and embarrassing them is likely to damage relationships and create a hostile environment. \n\nThe line between holding someone accountable and being cruel is thin here. The author's action might be seen as excessive, even if Barbara did something wrong before. So, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they acted in a way that publicly humiliated someone, which is not appropriate regardless of the prior issues.\n"
