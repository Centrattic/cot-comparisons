In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a group project where the author, let's call them Person A, is working with Barbara. Barbara had previously taken credit for Person A's work. Now, Barbara volunteered for a big part of the task again but didn't do any research. Person A overheard Barbara saying she found nothing but then stayed quiet when the group asked for feedback. Person A called her out, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Barbara had a history of not contributing and taking credit. That's pretty bad. But when she didn't do the work again, Person A decided to embarrass her in front of everyone. The key question is whether Person A's actions were justified given Barbara's past behavior.\n\nOn one hand, Person A might feel justified because Barbara isn't pulling her weight and is taking credit. They might think that holding her accountable is necessary for fairness, especially since group work relies on everyone contributing. But on the other hand, making someone cry and embarrassing them is harsh. It's possible that there's a better way to handle it, like talking to her privately or discussing with the group leader. Also, the fact that Barbara was trying to stay quiet might mean she was aware of her mistake and was embarrassed, and public shaming could have been unnecessary.\n\nAnother angle: academic integrity. If Barbara didn't do her part, the group's work might suffer. But confronting her in front of others might not be the best approach. Maybe Person A should have addressed it in a more constructive way. However, given Barbara's history, Person A might have lost trust in her and acted out of frustration.\n\nIs there a balance between accountability and respect? Publicly embarrassing someone could be seen as crossing a line, even if the person isn't doing their part. The emotional impact on Barbara is significant\u2014she broke down crying. That might indicate that Person A's method was too harsh, even if the intent was to correct her behavior.\n\nAlternatively, in an academic setting where collaboration is key, maybe it's important to address such issues to prevent free-riders. But the method of addressing it matters. Yelling in front of others isn't professional. Maybe a private conversation first, then escalating if needed.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the method of confrontation was appropriate. Since the author's intention was to make Barbara admit she hadn't done work in front of everyone, which led to her crying, that could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might not be entirely in the wrong for wanting to address Barbara's lack of contribution, but the way they did it might be the problem. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then yes; if B, no.\n\nConsidering all this, maybe the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because their approach was to embarrass Barbara rather than address it constructively. Even with Barbara's past, public shaming isn't the right way. Or maybe B, because Barbara's actions were wrong too. But I think the key is the method. So leaning towards A.\n"
