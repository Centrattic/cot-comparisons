In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong. The situation involves a classmate, Barbara, who previously didn't contribute and took credit for someone else's work. Now, Barbara was assigned the most important part of the task but didn't do it. The author called her out in front of everyone, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a bad experience before with Barbara not doing her part and taking credit. This time, Barbara didn't contribute again. The author overheard her talking to another student about not finding anything. Then, the author publicly asked Barbara about her research during the group session, which made Barbara cry.\n\nThe key points here are intent and the method used. The author's intention was likely to expose Barbara's lack of work, but did it in a way that embarrassed her. Even though Barbara might have deserved it because of her previous actions, the method of addressing it was in public, leading to emotional distress. \n\nHowever, the author's actions could be seen as justified given Barbara's history. The author might feel that exposing Barbara's lack of effort is necessary to prevent her from taking credit again. But on the other hand, confronting someone in front of others can be harsh, especially leading to them crying. It could be argued that the author should have handled it more privately to address the issue without public humiliation.\n\nAlso, the group leader was asking others to contribute, so the author's question was in the context of the group's task. The author might have felt that Barbara was trying to avoid responsibility, so the question was a way to hold her accountable. But even if Barbara was responsible, the way it was done might have been too direct and public, leading to embarrassment.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the method of confrontation was appropriate. If the goal was to make Barbara take responsibility, but the method caused unnecessary emotional harm, that could be seen as wrong. However, considering Barbara's past behavior, the author might have had valid reasons to call her out. The line between accountability and cruelty might be thin here.\n\nIn academic settings, collaboration is important, and holding peers accountable is expected. But public shaming can have negative effects. The author could have approached Barbara privately first to address the issue before making it public. By doing so, they could have given Barbara a chance to explain or correct her actions without the public humiliation. \n\nTherefore, while the author had a valid reason to be frustrated with Barbara, the method of addressing it in front of everyone might have been inappropriate. This could mean the author is in the wrong because they chose a harsh public confrontation instead of a more constructive private approach.\n"
