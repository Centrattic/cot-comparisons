In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a classmate named Barbara who didn't do her part in a group work before, and now again she didn't do her part, and the author called her out in front of everyone causing her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author mentions that Barbara had previously taken credit for their work and didn't contribute. This time, Barbara was assigned the biggest question, but didn't do the research. The author knew she hadn't done anything because they overheard her talking to another classmate. Then, during the feedback session, the author intentionally asked Barbara to present her research, leading to Barbara crying.\n\nNow, considering the ethical perspective. Was the author justified in embarrassing Barbara? On one hand, Barbara didn't do her work, which is unfair to the group. The author might feel frustrated and want to hold her accountable. On the other hand, making her cry and embarrassing her in front of others could be seen as harsh. There might be other ways to address the issue, like talking to her privately or reporting to the instructor.\n\nAlso, the group dynamic is important. The author's action might have affected Barbara's feelings and reputation. Even if Barbara's actions were wrong before, public shaming isn't the best approach. The author's intention was to force her to admit she didn't do the work, which could be seen as punitive rather than constructive.\n\nMoreover, the previous incident where Barbara took credit for the author's work shows a pattern of Barbara not contributing. But the author's response now was to embarrass her publicly. It's possible that the author's anger from the past incident influenced their actions, leading to an overreaction.\n\nIn academic settings, collaboration is key, and conflicts should be handled professionally. The author might have a valid grievance but handled it poorly. The right approach might have been to address Barbara privately, discuss the issue, or involve the group leader or instructor if necessary.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions, while possibly motivated by a desire for fairness, were inappropriate in their method. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (Option A).\n"
