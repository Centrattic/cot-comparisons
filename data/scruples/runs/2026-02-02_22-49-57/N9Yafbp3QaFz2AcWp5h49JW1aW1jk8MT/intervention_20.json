In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara by making her cry during a group task. The scenario involves Barbara not contributing before and taking credit for the author's work. Now, Barbara didn't do the work again, and the author called her out in front of the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Barbara had a history of not pulling her weight. Last time, she took credit for the author's work. This time, she volunteered for a major part but didn't do it. The author overheard her admitting she hadn't done anything and then called her out during the feedback session. The key here is intent. The author wanted her to publicly admit her failure, which led to her crying.\n\nIs it right to embarrass someone even if they've been negligent? Well, the group setting might require accountability. But there's a difference between holding someone accountable and intentionally embarrassing them. The author might have felt justified given Barbara's past actions, but the method of addressing it in front of everyone could be seen as harsh. It's possible the author was seeking revenge for the previous incident, which complicates things.\n\nAlso, the group dynamic is important. If Barbara's lack of contribution affects the whole group, pointing it out might be necessary for the project's success. However, doing it in a way that causes emotional distress could be counterproductive and unkind. Maybe the author should have addressed it privately first or approached the group leader instead.\n\nBut then again, if Barbara was trying to avoid responsibility by staying quiet, the author's action might be seen as ensuring transparency. Still, making her cry seems excessive. The question is whether the author overstepped, even if Barbara was at fault.\n\nConsidering both sides, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because Barbara's past behavior and current inaction warranted some form of accountability. However, the public humiliation aspect could be problematic. But given the context, maybe the author's actions were a justified response to Barbara's repeated failures. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
