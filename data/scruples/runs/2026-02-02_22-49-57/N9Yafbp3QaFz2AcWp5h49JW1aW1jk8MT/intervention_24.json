In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara. The situation is about group work in a master's program. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The setup is that they're working in groups for a presentation. In Session 1, they split up tasks. Barbara volunteered for a big question. The writer mentions a past incident where Barbara didn't contribute, took credit for their work, and now this time, Barbara didn't do her research again. The writer called her out in front of everyone, leading her to cry.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to consider both sides. Let's break down the key points. \n\nBarbara's previous behavior was bad\u2014she took credit for someone else's work. This time, she didn't do her part. The author noticed she wasn't contributing and asked her directly in front of the group, knowing she hadn't done anything. The author's intention was to make her admit it publicly. \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified because Barbara's past actions were harmful. The author might not want to let her get away with it again. But on the other hand, public shaming can be harsh and unkind. Even if Barbara deserves it, making her cry in front of others could be seen as bullying or not handling the situation professionally. \n\nGroup work in academic settings can be tricky. The author might have better ways to address the issue, like privately talking to Barbara or informing the instructor. Publicly calling her out could have been a way to take a stand, but it's possible the method was inappropriate. \n\nIs it about intent? The author's intention was to make Barbara take responsibility, but the result was embarrassing her. Even if the intention was good, the outcome might still be considered wrong in terms of interpersonal skills. Also, everyone makes mistakes, and perhaps the author could have handled it with more empathy. \n\nBut considering Barbara's past actions, the author might feel that a public confrontation is necessary to prevent her from taking credit again. However, making someone cry is a strong reaction. It's possible that the author's actions were a result of frustration from Barbara's previous behavior, but that doesn't necessarily excuse the public humiliation. \n\nIn academic environments, collaboration is key, and handling conflicts appropriately is important. The author might have violated that by not addressing it privately first. The line between holding someone accountable and being cruel is thin here. \n\nSo, weighing all this, the answer could be either A or B. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong (B). But maybe there's a middle ground where the action was wrong because it was done publicly and caused emotional distress, even if the intent was to correct Barbara's behavior. \n\nIn conclusion, while Barbara's actions were certainly problematic, the author's method of addressing it might be seen as wrong because it involved public humiliation. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong), but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the author had no better option and Barbara's past behavior justified it, then B. But the general consensus might lean towards A because of the emotional impact.\n"
