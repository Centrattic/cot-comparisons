In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a group project in a master's program. The user, let's call them 'A', is working with a classmate named Barbara. Last time they worked together, Barbara didn't contribute much\u2014she just got a guidance sheet from a tutor and didn't mention that, instead taking credit for A's work. Now, Barbara took on the biggest question again but didn't do any research. A noticed she was quiet during the discussion and decided to call her out in front of the group, which made Barbara cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Group projects can be tricky, especially when some members don't pull their weight. Last time, Barbara didn't contribute and took credit, which is unfair. This time, she's given herself an important task but didn't do it. A overheard Barbara talking to a classmate about not finding anything, so they knew she wasn't doing the work. A then publicly asked Barbara to present her findings, leading to her emotional breakdown.\n\nIs A being vindictive or right in holding Barbara accountable? On one hand, calling someone out in public can be harsh, especially if it leads to someone crying. But on the other hand, Barbara had a history of slacking and taking credit. A might have felt that this was a way to prevent Barbara from doing it again. Public shaming could be seen as mean, but maybe A's intent was to make sure the group's work was done properly.\n\nHowever, there's a line between accountability and humiliation. Even if Barbara deserved it, making her cry in front of everyone might be crossing that line. A might have wanted to teach her a lesson, but the method was harsh. Maybe a private confrontation would have been better, even if it's tempting to publicly call someone out for past behavior.\n\nAlso, considering the academic setting, the group's goal is to complete the project effectively. If Barbara wasn't contributing, others might feel it's their responsibility to ensure the task is done. But the way A handled it\u2014using a question to force Barbara into admitting she hadn't done the work\u2014could be seen as manipulative or cruel, even if the intent was to hold her accountable.\n\nI think the key points here are intent versus impact. A's intent was probably to prevent Barbara from freeloading again, but the impact was public humiliation, which is harmful. So while there might be understanding for A's frustration, the action itself could be seen as wrong because it caused emotional distress unnecessarily. However, some might argue that Barbara's past behavior justified the public call-out. It's a bit of a gray area. But in many ethical frameworks, the method matters. Even if the goal is just, the means can be unethical. So maybe A is in the wrong for handling it in a public and harsh manner.\n"
