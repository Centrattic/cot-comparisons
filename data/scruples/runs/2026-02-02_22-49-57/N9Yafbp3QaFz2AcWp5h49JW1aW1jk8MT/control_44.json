In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a group project where Barbara didn't do her part, and the author called her out in front of everyone, leading her to cry. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Barbara has a history of slacking off before\u2014she once took credit for the author's work. This time, she volunteered for the most important part of the task but didn't do any work. The group leader was asking for feedback, and Barbara stayed silent. The author, knowing she hadn't done anything, asked her directly, which made her cry.\n\nThe key points are: past behavior of Barbara, the author's intention to hold her accountable, and the public confrontation leading to emotional distress. \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified because Barbara didn't contribute and had a bad track record. The author might think it's necessary to prevent her from freeloading again. On the other hand, publicly embarrassing someone, even if they're at fault, can be harsh. The author's method of confrontation might have been too harsh, especially if Barbara was already stressed. \n\nBut then again, the group's goal is to get the work done. If Barbara isn't contributing, others might be left to pick up the slack. The author's action could be seen as trying to enforce accountability, but the way it was done\u2014publicly and knowing she had nothing\u2014could be seen as punitive rather than constructive. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they overheard Barbara talking about not doing the work. So, maybe the author had a reason to believe Barbara wasn't going to contribute. But intentionally making her cry and humiliating her in front of others is problematic. Even if Barbara is at fault, the approach taken might have been too much. \n\nAnother angle: group projects often require collaboration and respect. Publicly calling someone out in front of others can damage group dynamics and the person's self-esteem. Maybe there was a better way to handle it, like a private conversation or involving the group leader. The author's action might have been a knee-jerk reaction based on past experiences, but it's still harsh. \n\nSo, weighing the intention (accountability) against the method (public humiliation), the author might be in the wrong because the approach was unnecessarily harsh, even if the motivation was understandable. But some might argue that Barbara's past behavior justified a stronger response. However, public shaming is usually not the best solution. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
