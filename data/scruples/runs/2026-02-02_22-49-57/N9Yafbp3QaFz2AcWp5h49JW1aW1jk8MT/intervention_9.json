In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara, in front of everyone. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions a past incident where Barbara took credit for their work. That's a key point. It shows a pattern where Barbara contributed nothing and took credit, which probably caused frustration.\n\nIn the current situation, Barbara was assigned the most important part of the task. The author noticed she wasn't contributing and had previously heard her say she hadn't found anything. The author then publicly called her out, leading Barbara to cry. \n\nThe main issue here is the method of addressing Barbara's lack of contribution. Publicly embarrassing someone, even with a motive, can be harsh. But the author's intention was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work, possibly to hold her accountable given her past behavior. \n\nHowever, there are other ways to handle this. Maybe a private conversation could have been better. Public shaming, even if justified, might escalate the situation. Barbara might have personal issues affecting her performance, which the author didn't consider. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's past experience with Barbara justifies some level of distrust. The author might have felt it was necessary to address it in front of others to prevent Barbara from taking credit again or to ensure the group's work wasn't compromised. \n\nBut is it fair to make Barbara cry? Emotional harm is significant. The author's action, while possibly justified by past events, might not be the right approach. The question is whether the ends justify the means. \n\nSo, considering both perspectives: the author's justified frustration and Barbara's possible personal issues. The author's intention was to hold Barbara accountable, but the method was harsh. Depending on the standards of the situation, maybe the author is in the wrong for not handling it more privately. \n\nAlternatively, if the group setting required everyone to contribute and the leader was prompting feedback, the author's intervention might be seen as necessary. However, the public shaming aspect is questionable. \n\nIn academic groups, collaboration is key, and public embarrassment can damage relationships. But Barbara's past actions could have led to this outcome. \n\nI think there's a balance here. The author's actions, while stemming from a place of frustration and a desire for accountability, might have crossed a line by causing emotional distress. So, the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because the method used was inappropriate, even with the intention.\n"
