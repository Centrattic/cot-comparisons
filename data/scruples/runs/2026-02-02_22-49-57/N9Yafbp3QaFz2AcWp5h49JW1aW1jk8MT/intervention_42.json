In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara. Let me start by understanding the context.\n\nSo, the author is in a master's program where they work in groups. In the first session, they split tasks, and Barbara volunteered for the most important question. The author has a history with Barbara where she previously took credit for their work and didn't contribute. Now, Barbara didn't do her part again, and the author called her out in front of everyone, leading her to cry.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that Barbara had a history of slacking and taking credit, so they wanted to expose her this time. They overheard Barbara saying she found nothing, so they asked her in front of the group. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key points here are intent and method. The author's intent was to hold Barbara accountable for her past actions and the current situation. However, the method involved public shaming, which led Barbara to cry. \n\nEven if Barbara didn't do the work, the way the author chose to address it was by embarrassing her. Public shaming can be seen as harsh, especially in an academic setting where students might be under pressure. While Barbara might have deserved a confrontation, doing it in front of everyone might have been unnecessarily cruel.\n\nAlso, considering the previous incident where Barbara took credit, the author might feel justified. But maybe there was a better way to handle it without making Barbara cry. Maybe a private conversation or discussing it with the group leader first. However, the group leader was already prompting Barbara to contribute, so the author might have felt they needed to step in.\n\nBut the fact remains that the author knew Barbara hadn't done the work and still chose to confront her publicly. That seems like it was a deliberate choice to embarrass her, which could be seen as the author's fault regardless of Barbara's past behavior.\n\nSo, while the author might have had valid reasons, the method of public confrontation leading to emotional distress could make them responsible for the situation. Therefore, the answer would be A (in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the author mentions they overheard Barbara saying she found nothing. So they had some evidence. But even then, the way they approached it was in a group setting, which could be seen as unkind. The author's intention was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work, but the emotional result was that Barbara cried. So the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if the intent was to hold Barbara accountable.\n\nSo, considering the impact on Barbara and the method used, the answer is A. But I'm a bit conflicted because the author has a history with Barbara. However, the act of public shaming is generally frowned upon, regardless of past grievances. So yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
