In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara. The situation involves group work where the user has a past negative experience with Barbara taking credit for their work. Now, Barbara was assigned a key task but didn't contribute, and the user called her out in front of everyone, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user's past experience with Barbara is important. If Barbara previously didn't do her part and took credit, that might influence the user's actions. The user felt justified in confronting Barbara this time because of the prior incident. But the question is about whether the user was wrong in this specific situation.\n\nGroup dynamics can be tricky. The user's intention was to hold Barbara accountable, but doing so publicly might have been harsh. Even if Barbara didn't do her work, embarrassing her in front of others could be seen as bullying or unkind. The user mentions they overheard Barbara admitting she didn't do the work, so they knew she was hiding something. By calling her out, they forced her to confess publicly, which might have been unnecessary and hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, Barbara did choose to take on the most important part of the task and failed to deliver. The user might feel that the group's success depends on everyone contributing, so holding her accountable is necessary. However, the method of confrontation matters. Public shaming can damage relationships and create a hostile environment. The user's actions might be seen as justified if the goal was to ensure the group's work is done properly, but the emotional impact on Barbara is significant.\n\nAnother angle is the responsibility in group work. Maybe the user should have approached Barbara privately first, giving her a chance to explain or correct the situation before making it public. The user's history with Barbara might have clouded their judgment, leading to an overreaction. It's possible that Barbara had valid reasons for not completing the work, like personal issues, and the user didn't consider that.\n\nIn academic settings, collaboration and respect are key. Even if Barbara didn't do her part, the appropriate response might involve discussing the issue with the group or the instructor rather than publicly embarrassing her. The user's action might have been a personal response to past grievances rather than a professional approach.\n\nSo, weighing the intent versus the method. The user wanted accountability, but the method was harmful. The answer could be that the user is in the wrong because they chose a public and emotionally damaging approach instead of a more constructive one. However, others might argue that Barbara's repeated failures warrant some form of confrontation.\n\nConsidering all this, the user's action, while understandable given the history, might not be the most appropriate. The answer leans towards the user being in the wrong (A) because of the public shaming, but there's a case for the user not being in the wrong (B) if the intent was to ensure group work quality. But the negative impact on Barbara's emotional state is a strong point against the user.\n"
