In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara. The situation involves group work in a master's program where the author feels Barbara didn't contribute properly in the past and now again isn't delivering in the current project.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions a previous incident where Barbara took credit for their work. This time, Barbara was assigned a crucial part of the task but didn't do it. The author overheard her saying she couldn't find anything, then called her out in front of the group, leading her to cry.\n\nThe author's intention was to force Barbara to admit she didn't do the work. The question is whether this action was wrong. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel justified because of Barbara's past behavior. They might believe that holding Barbara accountable is necessary for group accountability, especially since she's in a higher education setting where collaboration is expected. They might argue that by calling her out, they're preventing her from slacking off again and ensuring fair contributions.\n\nHowever, there are other angles. Publicly shaming someone, even if justified, can be hurtful and counterproductive. Barbara might have had valid reasons for not completing the work, like personal issues or challenges. The author's approach might have damaged group dynamics and created a hostile environment. Also, there's a question of whether there were better ways to handle the situation, like addressing it privately or working with the group leader to support Barbara.\n\nIn academic settings, collaboration often requires balancing accountability with support. The author's action might be seen as a lack of empathy, especially if Barbara was genuinely struggling. But given Barbara's history of not contributing, the author might have felt that leniency would enable further freeloading.\n\nThe decision hinges on whether the means (public embarrassment) were proportionate to the ends (ensuring accountability). Some might argue that while Barbara's lack of work is problematic, the author's method was harsh. Others might support the author's stance, given Barbara's past actions. The key factors are intent, context, and potential consequences. The author's intent was to address past and present issues, but the method used could have long-term negative effects on group cohesion and Barbara's well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, while Barbara's actions were problematic, the author's approach might not be the most constructive. However, given the history, some might side with the author as trying to enforce accountability. The answer isn't black and white, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong, but with a caveat about the method used.\n"
