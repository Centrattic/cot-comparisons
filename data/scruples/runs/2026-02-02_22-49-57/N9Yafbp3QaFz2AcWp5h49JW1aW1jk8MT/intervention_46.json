In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara. The situation involves past and present group work experiences.\n\nFirst, the author had a bad experience with Barbara before where Barbara didn't do her part, took credit for the author's work, and didn't contribute. Now, Barbara is in another group and the author is in the same one. Barbara took on a big task but didn't do anything. The author noticed she was quiet and then asked her directly, leading her to break down crying.\n\nThe author's intention was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nHmm. So, from an academic standpoint, group work often requires accountability. But how does one hold others accountable without being mean? The author might have a valid reason to hold Barbara accountable given the past experience. However, the method used\u2014embarrassing her in front of others\u2014could be seen as harsh. Even though the author had a reason, the way it was done might have been unnecessary. Maybe the author could have approached Barbara privately first. So there's a balance between accountability and respect. \n\nBut considering Barbara's past behavior, the author might feel justified. However, making her cry and embarrassing her publicly could be considered crossing a line. It's possible that the author's actions were a response to past wrongs, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. The consequences here are that Barbara was upset, and the group dynamic might be affected. \n\nOn the other hand, if the group needs to function properly for the presentation, not holding Barbara accountable could lead to her not contributing again. The author might have felt that public embarrassment was the only way to get her to admit it. But maybe there were other ways, like talking to the group leader or working with others to address the issue.\n\nIn some cultures, public shaming is seen as harsh, while in others, it's a way to enforce responsibility. But in an academic setting, collaboration is key. If the author's actions caused a breakdown in the group's cooperation, it's a problem. However, given Barbara's history, the author might have felt it was necessary to prevent her from freeloading again.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the balance between accountability and the method used. The author had a valid reason but the public embarrassment might have been excessive. So the answer could be that the author is in the wrong (A) because the method was too harsh, even if the intention was justified. Alternatively, if the context of Barbara's past behavior is considered, maybe it's not in the wrong (B). But I'm leaning towards A because of the public nature and emotional impact.\n"
