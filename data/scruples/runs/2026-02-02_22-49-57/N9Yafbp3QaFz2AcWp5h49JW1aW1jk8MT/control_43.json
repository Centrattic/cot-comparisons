In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara. The situation involves group work where Barbara previously didn't contribute and took credit for someone else's work. Now, in a new group task, Barbara again didn't do her part and the author called her out in front of everyone, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical implications. The author's past experience with Barbara is relevant. Barbara's previous behavior was unethical\u2014she didn't do her work and took credit. The author might feel justified in holding her accountable. However, the method used was public shaming, which can be harsh and potentially humiliating.\n\nThe key points here are intent and the impact. The author intended to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work, which could be seen as a way to ensure accountability. But public embarrassment can cross a line, even if the person being embarrassed has a history of poor conduct. The fact that Barbara was already upset and cried suggests that the approach might have been too harsh.\n\nAnother angle is the group setting. Since it's a collaborative environment, fostering a respectful atmosphere is important. Publicly calling out a peer might discourage others from participating or create a hostile environment. Even if Barbara had wronged the author before, the response should consider the broader group dynamics.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that Barbara's inaction was affecting the group's progress and that accountability is necessary. The author might feel that Barbara's repeated behavior warranted a strong reaction to prevent her from freeloading again.\n\nBut does intent absolve the action? Even if the author had good intentions, the method of public shaming might still be considered inappropriate. There could have been a more constructive way to address the issue, like speaking to Barbara privately or discussing it with the group leader.\n\nAlso, considering the emotional impact\u2014Barbara cried and felt embarrassed. The author's action, while perhaps driven by past grievances, caused public distress. This could be seen as unkind, regardless of Barbara's past actions.\n\nIn academic settings, collaboration relies on mutual respect and support. While holding peers accountable is important, the approach should be respectful. The author might have overstepped by not giving Barbara a chance to explain or resolve the issue privately.\n\nIn conclusion, while Barbara's actions were inexcusable, the author's method of addressing it was harsh and publicly embarrassing, which is generally considered wrong in a group setting. The correct answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
