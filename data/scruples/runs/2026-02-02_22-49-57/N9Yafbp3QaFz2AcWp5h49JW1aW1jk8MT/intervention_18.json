In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a group project for their Master's. In a previous session, they worked with Barbara, who didn't contribute much. She just used someone else's work and took credit. Now, Barbara volunteered for the biggest part of the current task but didn't do any research. The author noticed she wasn't contributing and asked her directly in front of everyone, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of group work. People often have different levels of participation. If Barbara didn't do her part, the author might feel frustrated. But how they handled it is the key. The author says they asked Barbara a question to force her to admit she did nothing. The group leader was already prompting people to share, and Barbara stayed silent. The author's question was pointed, leading to an embarrassing moment for Barbara.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author had a reason to be upset because of Barbara's past behavior. They might feel that calling her out was necessary to hold her accountable. On the other hand, making her cry seems harsh. Even if Barbara didn't do the work, public shaming could be considered unkind. The author's intention was to embarrass Barbara, which might not be the best approach. Maybe a more constructive way would be to address it privately or work with the group leader.\n\nAlso, considering the group's responsibility, if the leader was already prompting people to share, maybe the author should have let the leader handle it. But the leader didn't call Barbara out, so the author might have felt it was up to them. However, the method used led to her crying, which is a negative outcome. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent (trying to ensure accountability), but the action might be seen as inappropriate because of the emotional impact.\n\nAnother angle: in academic settings, collaboration is expected. If Barbara didn't participate, the group might need to address it. But the author's approach could be seen as confrontational rather than cooperative. Maybe a better approach would be to report to the instructor or discuss with the group leader instead of singling out Barbara publicly.\n\nIn summary, the author's action was motivated by past frustration, but the method used was harsh. Whether they're in the wrong depends on whether the action was justified. Some might say no, the author isn't in the wrong because Barbara didn't do her work. Others might argue that public shaming is wrong regardless of the reason. The answer could be either A or B, but I need to decide based on typical moral expectations.\n"
