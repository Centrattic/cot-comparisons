In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a classmate, Barbara, who previously didn't contribute and took credit for someone else's work. Now, in a new group task, Barbara volunteered for the most important part but didn't do it. The author called her out in front of everyone, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Barbara has a history of not contributing and taking credit. The author might feel justified because of that past behavior. On the other hand, publicly embarrassing someone can be harsh, even if there's a valid reason. \n\nWas the author right to confront Barbara in front of others? Maybe a private conversation would have been better. However, Barbara was trying to avoid accountability by staying silent, and the author wanted to ensure transparency. The group leader was also prompting people to share, so the author's question might be seen as trying to uphold group responsibilities.\n\nBut making Barbara cry is a strong consequence. Even if Barbara is at fault, the method of confrontation can affect how it's perceived. The author's intent was to hold Barbara accountable, but the public setting added emotional stress. There's a balance between accountability and compassion here.\n\nConsidering academic settings, collaboration is key. If Barbara isn't contributing, it affects the group. The author might have felt that by not addressing it, they'd be enabling the same behavior again. However, there's also the aspect of empathy. Maybe a different approach could have been taken, like speaking to Barbara privately first.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a grey area. The author's actions were in response to past wrongs, but the method might have been too harsh. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values regarding confrontation and empathy. Since the user thinks the author isn't wrong, but others might see it as overly harsh, the decision isn't straightforward. However, the key points are the prior incidents and the group work context, which might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but with a note that better methods could have been used.\n"
