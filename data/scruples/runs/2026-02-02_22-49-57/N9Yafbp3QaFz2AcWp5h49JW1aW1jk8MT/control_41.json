In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a classmate named Barbara who didn't do her part in a group project before and took credit. Now, in another group task, Barbara took on a big question but didn't do any research. The author noticed she was quiet and then called her out in front of everyone, making her cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of group work. When someone doesn't contribute, it's a problem. The author had a bad experience before with Barbara, so there's some resentment. The author overheard Barbara saying she hadn't found anything, so they decided to confront her publicly.\n\nIs it right to embarrass someone like that? Well, the author had a motive: they wanted Barbara to admit she didn't do the work. But public shaming can be hurtful. Even if Barbara didn't contribute, making her cry in front of others might be crossing a line. The author could have addressed it privately, maybe talked to Barbara first or informed the group leader. Instead, they chose a public confrontation, which led to emotional distress.\n\nAlso, the author's past with Barbara might be influencing their actions. The previous incident where Barbara took credit for the author's work adds tension. But that doesn't justify public shaming. There's a difference between holding someone accountable and being cruel. The author's intent was to make Barbara admit her failure, but the method was harsh.\n\nIn academic settings, collaboration is key. However, dealing with slacking members can be tricky. The right approach might involve reporting the issue to a teacher or mediator rather than handling it directly in a way that's emotionally damaging. So, the author's actions, while perhaps understandable due to past frustration, were not the appropriate response. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they chose a public and harsh method to address Barbara's lack of contribution, leading to her crying.\n"
