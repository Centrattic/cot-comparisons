In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara and making her cry. The situation involves group work for a Master's program. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, in a previous group task, Barbara didn't do her part. The author did all the research and prepared a detailed table, but Barbara brought in a guidance sheet from a tutor and took credit for the work. That's pretty bad. She didn't even mention her own sheet, which wasn't relevant, and presented the author's work as if they had done it together.\n\nNow, in the current session, Barbara volunteered for the most important question again. The author overheard her admitting to not finding anything. When the group leader asked for feedback, Barbara stayed silent. The author then publicly asked her about her research, leading her to cry and confess she hadn't done anything. The author's intention was to make her admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they're not, but I need to consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, Barbara has a history of not contributing and taking credit. The author felt wronged before and might be acting out of justified frustration. The group is supposed to collaborate, and if Barbara isn't pulling her weight, others might suffer. The author's action could be seen as holding her accountable, even if it was harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, publicly shaming someone can be unkind, especially if it leads to emotional distress. The author's intention was to embarrass her, which is a negative approach. Even if Barbara is at fault, the method of addressing it might be inappropriate. The group's dynamic and the teacher's expectations matter here. Maybe the author should have approached the situation privately or let the group leader handle it.\n\nI need to weigh the intent vs. the impact. The author's intent was to make Barbara take responsibility, which is understandable. But the impact was her crying and embarrassment. In academic settings, while accountability is important, maintaining a respectful environment is also key. \n\nConsidering that Barbara had previously taken credit for the author's work, there's a pattern of behavior. However, the author's reaction this time might be an overstep. Instead of calling her out publicly, maybe they should have discussed it with the group leader or addressed it privately. Public shaming can be counterproductive and harmful, even if the person is being lazy.\n\nSo, while Barbara's actions are clearly wrong, the author's method of addressing it by embarrassing her might not be the right approach. Therefore, the author is partially in the wrong for their handling of the situation, even if Barbara deserved to be held accountable.\n"
