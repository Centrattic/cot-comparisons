In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to understand the context.\n\nSo, the author is in a group work situation for a Masters program. They're working in groups every two weeks on presentations. Last time, Barbara was in their group and she got a tutor to send her a guidance sheet, which wasn't really relevant. The author did most of the work and Barbara took credit. This time, Barbara volunteered for the most important part of the task but didn't contribute. The author noticed she wasn't talking and heard her say she hadn't found anything. So, during the feedback, the author called her out by linking her research to the question, making Barbara cry.\n\nThe key points here are the past interaction where Barbara didn't contribute and took credit, and the current situation where the author made Barbara embarrassed. The author's intention was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The ethical considerations here involve intent and the consequences. The author had a prior bad experience with Barbara, which might have influenced their actions. However, publicly shaming someone, even if justified by past actions, can be harsh. The question is whether the author acted appropriately to address Barbara's lack of contribution without being cruel.\n\nPossible angles: The author might argue self-defense against past exploitation, but the method of confrontation led to emotional harm. Alternatively, the author could be seen as holding Barbara accountable, which is necessary in group work. However, the approach was confrontational and public, which might be seen as unkind regardless of Barbara's previous actions.\n\nIn academic settings, collaboration is key, and addressing non-participation is important. But the method of addressing it can affect team dynamics. The author's intention was to hold Barbara accountable, but the outcome was emotional distress. Even if Barbara deserved it, causing her to cry might be excessive. The author could have approached Barbara privately to discuss the issue instead of making it public. Public embarrassment, even if justified, can damage relationships and create a hostile environment, which is counterproductive for future collaborations.\n\nTherefore, while Barbara's actions were wrong, the author's method of response may be inconsiderate. So, the author is partially at fault for not handling it more discreetly. Hence, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
