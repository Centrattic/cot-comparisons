In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara. The situation involves academic group work, past issues with Barbara, and the current incident where the author called out Barbara in front of everyone, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and Barbara had a previous problem where Barbara didn't contribute, took credit for the author's work, and used someone else's guidance sheet. This time, Barbara was responsible for the most important part of the task but didn't do any work. The author noticed she was quiet during the feedback and, knowing she hadn't done anything, asked her directly in front of the group, causing her to break down.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nTo evaluate, I should consider ethical and academic conduct. In group projects, collaboration and accountability are important. If Barbara didn't do her part, there's an expectation that others might address it. However, the method used by the author was public shaming, which led to Barbara crying. That's a significant emotional impact.\n\nIs there a better way to handle it? Maybe, but the author's intention was to hold Barbara accountable for her past behavior. However, calling someone out in front of a group can be harsh. But Barbara had a history of not contributing, so the author might feel justified. However, the emotional consequence is a factor. \n\nAcademic policies often encourage addressing issues constructively. Public embarrassment might not be the best approach, even if the intent is to correct behavior. The author's past experience with Barbara might have influenced their reaction, but the method of confronting her publicly could still be seen as harsh. \n\nBut Barbara was responsible for a key part and chose to be silent. The author might believe that the group deserved honesty, and by not addressing Barbara's lack of work, the group wouldn't get the information they needed. However, making her cry is a serious outcome. \n\nIt's a nuanced situation. The author's actions could be seen as holding Barbara accountable, but the method was harmful. Alternatively, the author might be in the right because Barbara didn't fulfill her responsibilities. However, the public shaming aspect could make the author at fault. \n\nConsidering that the author knew Barbara hadn't done the work beforehand and used that knowledge to call her out intentionally, maybe the author is in the wrong for not using a more private approach. But Barbara's past behavior complicates it. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's action was necessary and appropriate. Since there's a history, but public humiliation isn't typically a constructive response, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong). However, some might argue that Barbara's inconsiderate actions justified the response. \n\nBut given that the result was Barbara crying and being embarrassed, it's more likely that the author should have addressed it privately first. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
