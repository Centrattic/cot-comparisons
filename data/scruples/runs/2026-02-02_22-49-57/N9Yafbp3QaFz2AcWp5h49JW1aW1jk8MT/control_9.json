In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves a group project in a Masters program. The user is in a group with Barbara, who previously didn't contribute much and took credit for someone else's work. Now, Barbara volunteered for the most important part of the current project but didn't do any work. The user, knowing she didn't contribute, called her out in front of everyone, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Barbara's past behavior was pretty bad\u2014she didn't do her part, took credit, and didn't even mention her irrelevant work. The user is clearly frustrated and probably wanted to expose her this time. But the question is whether calling her out in a way that made her cry is appropriate.\n\nI should think about intent. The user's goal was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work, which might be justified in holding her accountable, but the method was public shaming. Publicly embarrassing someone, even if they've wronged you before, can be harsh. However, in an academic setting, sometimes you need to ensure everyone contributes fairly. If Barbara's lack of work affects the group's performance, the user might be trying to address that.\n\nBut there's also the emotional impact. Making someone cry is a strong reaction. Even if Barbara is at fault, the user's approach could have been more constructive. Maybe they could have privately addressed her first or worked with the group leader to handle it. Publicly calling her out might not be the best approach, even if the user's intention was to get the group to acknowledge Barbara's lack of work.\n\nAnother angle: group dynamics. The user might feel that Barbara is a free rider, and by exposing her, they're trying to prevent her from taking credit again. However, the method used here was confrontational and led to emotional distress. There's a balance between accountability and empathy. Even if Barbara is in the wrong, the user's actions might have been too harsh, especially considering Barbara might be stressed or have other issues contributing to her breakdown.\n\nAlso, the user mentions they overheard Barbara talking to another classmate about not finding anything. So they had prior knowledge but chose to confront her publicly. Maybe a more supportive approach could have been better, like encouraging her to ask for help or offering assistance instead of shaming.\n\nIn academic group work, there's often a need for collaboration and support. While Barbara's behavior is poor, the user's response might not foster a positive learning environment. The user is trying to enforce accountability, but the method might be counterproductive in the long term, damaging group cohesion or creating a hostile environment.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The user had valid reasons to be upset with Barbara's past and present actions, but their response of public confrontation leading to emotional distress might not be the right approach. They could have handled it more discreetly or constructively. Therefore, the answer might be that the user is partially at fault for their method, even if Barbara was wrong.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (Yes) or B (No). Considering that the user's intent was to hold Barbara accountable, but the method was inappropriate, maybe the answer is A. However, some might argue that in a group project, ensuring contributions are valid is necessary, and the user was justified. But since the user knew Barbara hadn't done work and used that to call her out in a way that embarrassed her, the answer might be A. Alternatively, if the situation required such action to prevent unfair credit again, maybe B. Hmm, tricky.\n\nI think the key is the public shaming aspect. Even if Barbara deserved it, the way the user handled it was unkind. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they chose a method that caused emotional harm instead of addressing it more privately or constructively.\n"
