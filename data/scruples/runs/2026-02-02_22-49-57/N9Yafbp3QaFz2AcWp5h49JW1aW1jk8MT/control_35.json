In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara. The situation involves group work for a Masters program.\n\nFirst, there's a history between the author and Barbara from a previous group project. Barbara didn't contribute, took credit for the author's work, and just brought an irrelevant sheet she got from a tutor. The author was upset about that. Now, in this new project, Barbara chose the most important question to research but didn't do any work. The author noticed she was quiet during the session, overheard her saying she couldn't find anything, and then called her out in front of the group, leading Barbara to cry.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's actions were wrong. The author's intention was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work, which led to her embarrassment and crying. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has a valid grievance from the past. Barbara's previous behavior was dishonest and unfair. The author might have felt justified in holding Barbara accountable this time. However, the method used\u2014publicly calling her out in a way that made her cry\u2014could be seen as harsh and counterproductive. \n\nGroup work settings require collaboration and professionalism. While it's important to address non-participation, doing so in a public and humiliating manner might not be the best approach. It could damage team dynamics and create a hostile environment. The author could have approached Barbara privately first to address the issue, possibly offering help or discussing the problem without embarrassing her in front of others.\n\nAlso, even though Barbara didn't contribute, the author's response might have been excessive. Instead of making her feel worse, the focus should be on solving the problem or getting the work done. The author's past experience with Barbara might have influenced their reaction, leading to an emotional response rather than a professional one.\n\nIn academic settings, it's crucial to handle conflicts maturely. Public shaming, even if motivated by past grievances, isn't typically considered appropriate. The author might have been trying to correct Barbara's behavior, but the method used was inconsiderate of Barbara's feelings and the professional context.\n\nOn the flip side, Barbara did choose to take on the most important part and then failed to deliver. The author has a right to be concerned about the group's success and might feel frustrated. However, the way the author addressed it was problematic. There's a balance between holding peers accountable and maintaining respect.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions, while possibly motivated by a need to address Barbara's inaction, were likely inappropriate. The public confrontation and resulting emotional harm suggest that the author overstepped, even if the intent was to ensure accountability. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
