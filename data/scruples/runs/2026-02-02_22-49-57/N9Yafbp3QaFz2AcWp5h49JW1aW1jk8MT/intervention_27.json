In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a classmate named Barbara who previously didn't contribute properly and took credit for someone else's work. Now, this person is in a group again where Barbara was assigned the most important part of the task but didn't do it. When the group leader asked for feedback, Barbara stayed quiet, so the author called her out, leading to her crying.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author's past experience with Barbara is that she relied on someone else's work and took credit. This time, Barbara volunteered for the biggest question but didn't do it. The author overheard her saying she couldn't find anything but didn't contribute during the session. The author's intention was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone, which caused her to cry.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nI should consider the ethics of the situation. When Barbara didn't do any work before and took credit, the author was upset. Now, the author is trying to prevent Barbara from doing the same again. However, calling her out in front of everyone might have been harsh. Even though Barbara may have been at fault, the author's method of addressing it publically could be seen as mean or unnecessary, especially leading to her crying. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of group work dynamics. In academic settings, accountability is important. If Barbara didn't do her part, the group could fail, so the author might be trying to hold her accountable. However, doing it in a public setting where she's made to feel embarrassed could be counterproductive. The group leader was already prompting her, so maybe the author could have approached her privately instead of publicly shaming her. \n\nThe intention matters here. The author wanted Barbara to admit she didn't work, but the public call-out might have been a way to force accountability. However, the outcome was that Barbara cried, which is a negative reaction. Maybe the author should have handled it differently, but the original scenario might not be the author's fault for trying to address the issue. \n\nConsidering the possible consequences: Barbara might feel humiliated, which is not a good environment for learning. The author's past experience with her could have influenced their reaction, maybe leading to a preemptive strike. But is it right to use that past to publicly shame someone again? \n\nAlso, the group's responsibility. The group leader was already checking if everyone contributed. The author could have mentioned Barbara's lack of contribution to the leader or discussed it privately. Publicly embarrassing her might not be the right approach, even if Barbara is at fault. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on whether the actions were justified. The author's action was to call out Barbara's inaction, but the method used caused emotional distress. While Barbara's actions were wrong, the author's response could be seen as mean. However, the author might have felt justified given Barbara's history. \n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because Barbara did have a history of not contributing, and the author might have been trying to prevent her from taking credit again. However, the method of public shaming is questionable. But since the user is asking a yes or no (A/B) answer, I need to decide based on whether the author is in the wrong as per the scenario. \n\nIn many cases, even if someone has a past issue, public confrontation is not the best approach. The author could have handled it more privately. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for the method. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the action was intended to correct Barbara's behavior but done in a harmful way, that could still be considered wrong. \n\nAlternatively, in a group work context, if the group needs Barbara's part to complete the task, the author might be trying to help the group by getting her to admit she didn't do the work. But making her cry is an extreme reaction. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they chose to embarrass Barbara publicly, which is unkind, even if their intention was to address past issues. However, the user thinks the author is not wrong (B), so I need to check if there's a justification. \n\nAnother angle: the group leader was already prompting Barbara, so the author's question might have been a way to push her. But the approach of specifically calling out her previous inaction in a new context could be seen as harsh. \n\nIn summary, while Barbara's actions were wrong, the author's method of handling it might have crossed a line. However, if the author's intention was to ensure the group's work was done properly, maybe it's a gray area. But since the question is AITA, and the outcome was Barbara crying, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the public embarrassment. But maybe B if considering the author was trying to hold her accountable given past behavior. Need to decide based on the balance between accountability and kindness.\n"
