In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is at fault for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the context is a group project for a master's program. The setup has two sessions: in the first, they plan and assign tasks, and in the second, they present their findings. Barbara volunteered for the most important question this time. The author has a past experience where Barbara didn't contribute, took credit for their work, and relied on someone else's guidance sheet. Now, in the current project, Barbara didn't do her research, stayed quiet, and the author called her out, leading her to cry.\n\nThe author's defense is that Barbara hadn't done any work and they wanted her to admit it in front of everyone. The question is whether the author was wrong to do that.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author might feel justified because of Barbara's past behavior. They might think she's trying to do the same again. But on the other hand, making someone cry and embarrassing them in public is harsh. Even if Barbara didn't contribute, the approach could be seen as bullying or not professional. The author could have addressed it privately or with the group leader instead.\n\nThe key points here are intent and method. The author's intent was to expose Barbara's lack of work, but the method led to emotional distress. There's a difference between holding someone accountable and being unnecessarily harsh. Also, considering the academic environment, collaboration is important, and public shaming might not be the best way to handle it. Maybe the author should have reported it to the instructor instead. \n\nBut then again, if Barbara was avoiding responsibility, the author might feel that the group needs to know. However, it's possible that Barbara had other issues or couldn't complete the work for reasons unknown. Publicly embarrassing someone might not be the best solution. \n\nSo, balancing all that, I think the author is partially at fault. They had a valid concern but handled it in a way that was hurtful. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even if justified, the action was not constructive and caused emotional harm. Alternatively, some might argue that the past behavior of Barbara justifies the action, but generally, public shaming is discouraged.\n"
