In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a classmate named Barbara who previously didn't contribute much and took credit for someone else's work. Now, Barbara again took on a major part of the project but didn't do any work, and the author called her out, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that Barbara had a history of not contributing and taking credit. That's a key point. When Barbara didn't contribute this time, the author decided to embarrass her in front of everyone to make her admit she did nothing. The author's intention was to hold Barbara accountable for her past and current actions.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, is it right to embarrass someone publicly, even if they've done something wrong? Public shaming can have negative consequences, even if the person deserves it. It might damage relationships and create a hostile environment. On the other hand, the author might feel that Barbara's actions were unfair and that calling her out was necessary for fairness and group accountability.\n\nHowever, the method used\u2014making Barbara cry and embarrassing her\u2014might be seen as harsh. Maybe there were other ways to address the issue without public humiliation. The author could have spoken to Barbara privately first or reported the issue to the instructor instead of confronting her in front of the group.\n\nAlso, considering group work dynamics, the author's action could discourage others from participating if they fear public embarrassment. It's important to balance accountability with empathy. While Barbara's actions were wrong, the author's response might have been excessive.\n\nSo, while Barbara's behavior was inconsiderate and unprofessional, the author's approach of public shaming could be seen as the wrong way to handle it. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because Barbara did have a history of misconduct, but the method of confrontation could be questioned. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the action led to Barbara crying and public embarrassment, the author's approach might be considered too harsh, making them the asshole despite Barbara's actions. So, the answer might lean towards A, but it's a bit of a gray area.\n"
