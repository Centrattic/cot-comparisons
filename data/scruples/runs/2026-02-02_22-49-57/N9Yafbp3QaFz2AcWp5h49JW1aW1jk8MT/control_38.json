In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara. \n\nFirst, look at the situation. Barbara previously took credit for the author's work and didn't contribute properly. Now, she's been assigned the most important part of the task again but didn't do the work. The author called her out in front of everyone, leading to Barbara crying.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they wanted to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work. But was this the right approach? In a group setting, accountability is important. If someone isn't pulling their weight, addressing it is necessary, but the method matters. Public shaming might be harsh, especially if Barbara was already struggling. \n\nThe author had prior reasons to be upset with Barbara. However, intentionally embarrassing someone to make them admit fault could be seen as retaliatory, especially since Barbara was emotional. The context includes Barbara's history of not contributing, which might justify the author's frustration. But the method of addressing it in a public, potentially humiliating way might be the issue. \n\nAlternatives: Maybe the author could have approached Barbara privately first. But since Barbara was trying to avoid attention, public confrontation might have been the only way to get her to speak up. The author might feel justified in holding Barbara accountable given her past actions. However, making her cry seems excessive. \n\nConsidering the dynamics, the group leader was present, and the author's question forced Barbara to reveal her lack of work in front of everyone. The key points are accountability vs. public shaming. The author had a valid reason to be upset, but the execution might be where they went wrong. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, they're enforcing accountability. On the other, the method was harsh. But given Barbara's past behavior, maybe the author felt it was necessary to prevent her from taking credit again. However, making her cry indicates it was hurtful. In academic settings, group work requires collaboration, and public humiliation can damage relationships and trust. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because even if Barbara didn't do the work, the way the author approached it was mean and led to emotional distress. But there's a counterpoint that the author had a right to be concerned about group dynamics. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong (B) because Barbara's actions were problematic. \n\nWait, maybe the key is whether the author had a right to act that way. The author's intention was to hold Barbara accountable, but the method was inappropriate. The fact that Barbara was crying suggests it was too harsh. So the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because the approach was harmful despite valid frustrations.\n"
