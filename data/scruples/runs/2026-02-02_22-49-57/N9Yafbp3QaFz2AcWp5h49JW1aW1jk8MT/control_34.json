In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara and making her cry. The situation is a group project where Barbara previously didn't contribute much, took credit for the author's work, and now she's being called out again for not doing her part.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. In the first session, Barbara was given a big research task but didn't do it. The author had prior experience where Barbara didn't contribute and took credit, so there's some resentment there. In the current session, the author noticed Barbara hadn't contributed and decided to confront her in front of others. They overheard her saying she couldn't find anything, so they asked her a question that would force her to admit it. The result was Barbara crying and feeling embarrassed.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, Barbara didn't do her work, which is frustrating, especially given her past behavior. The author might feel justified in holding her accountable. But on the other hand, calling her out publicly led to her emotional distress. The author's intention was to make her \"have to say in front of everyone\" she didn't do work. That seems manipulative or harsh, even if Barbara was at fault.\n\nGroup projects can be tricky. The author has a right to be concerned about Barbara's lack of contribution, but the method of addressing it matters. Publicly shaming someone, even if they're guilty, can be seen as unkind and counterproductive. Instead of confronting her in front of others, maybe the author should have addressed it privately first. But the author might argue that they tried during the session when the group was supposed to feedback, and Barbara was intentionally staying quiet to avoid accountability.\n\nAlso, the ethical angle: taking credit for others' work is bad, but making someone cry by embarrassing them might cross a line. The author's past experience with Barbara could influence their reaction here, making them more hostile. The question is about the rightness of the action, not just the outcome. Even if Barbara didn't do her work, the author's method might be the issue.\n\nAnother point: the group leader was already prompting Barbara, so the author's question was a direct response to her silence. Maybe the author felt the need to push her to be honest. However, the emotional impact on Barbara is significant. It's a judgment call between accountability and respect.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they might not be entirely wrong because Barbara did underperform, but the way they handled it could be problematic. The answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because publicly embarrassing someone, even to expose their inaction, can be seen as harsh and unprofessional. Alternatively, B (No) if the author's intent was to ensure the project's success and they felt Barbara's past behavior justified this approach. I'm leaning towards A because the method was confrontational and caused emotional harm, even if the motivation was to address Barbara's irresponsibility.\n"
