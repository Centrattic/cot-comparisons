In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called out their classmate, Barbara, is in the wrong. The situation involves group work where Barbara previously didn't contribute and took credit for someone else's work. This time, she volunteered for a key part but didn't do the work. The author confronted her in front of the group, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. Barbara's past behavior was bad\u2014she didn't contribute, took credit, and now she's doing the same. The author might be justified in wanting to hold her accountable. However, the method was public shaming, which can be harsh. Even if the intent was to get her to acknowledge her lack of work, making her cry seems excessive. \n\nBut considering Barbara had already been quiet and might have been trying to avoid attention, the author's action forced her to confront her inaction. The question is whether the author's approach was appropriate. Publicly embarrassing someone, even if they're at fault, can be counterproductive and hurtful. The author might have had a valid reason but used a poor method. Alternatively, they might have acted in self-defense to prevent her from freeriding again.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to ensure group work is fair. On the other, the public confrontation might have been unnecessary. The key points are Barbara's history and the immediate context. The author's intent was to make her admit she didn't do the work, but the outcome was emotional distress. \n\nPossible arguments for the author not being in the wrong: Barbara's past actions justify the response. The author might feel they're protecting the group's integrity. However, the method could have been more constructive, like a private conversation. \n\nArguments for being in the wrong: Public shaming can damage relationships and might not be effective. The author could have handled it more privately, even if Barbara's actions were wrong. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the method used was appropriate. The act of embarrassing her in front of everyone led to her crying, which is a strong negative outcome. Even if Barbara deserved accountability, the approach was harsh. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they prioritized their own satisfaction or justice over Barbara's well-being, using a method that was unnecessarily harsh. Alternatively, if the intent was to enforce accountability and prevent freeloading, maybe not. But the emotional impact suggests the method was wrong.\n"
