Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their older brother he should help with their dad's funeral. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe dad was abusive to Jeff, the older brother, especially when he drank. The narrator, the younger sibling, wasn't around when the abuse happened, but they heard stories from both Jeff and their mom. Jeff left home at 18, and the dad became less abusive after the narrator was born. Now, the dad died, and Jeff refuses to help with the funeral, leading the narrator to confront him, saying he has an obligation to help for their mom's sake. Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the question is whether the narrator is in the wrong. The user thinks they're not, but wants my opinion. \n\nFirst, the narrator's intention was to support their mom by trying to get Jeff to help. Jeff's past with the dad is significant\u2014abuse is serious. The narrator acknowledges that Jeff has reasons not to help, but still thinks Jeff should for their mom. \n\nIs it right to expect Jeff to help despite his trauma? The narrator went to Jeff's home to convince him, which is respectful. However, the pressure might be invalidating Jeff's feelings. On the other hand, the mom is upset not getting support from both kids. The narrator's approach was to talk to Jeff respectfully, not force him. \n\nThe key points are the abuse Jeff endured and whether the narrator overstepped by saying he \"has an obligation.\" Obligations can be cultural or family expectations, but considering Jeff's history, maybe the narrator should have been more understanding. However, the narrator's action was to mediate and help their mom, which is a valid concern. \n\nI think the narrator isn't in the wrong because they tried to reconcile the family's needs without forcing Jeff. The answer is B.\n"
