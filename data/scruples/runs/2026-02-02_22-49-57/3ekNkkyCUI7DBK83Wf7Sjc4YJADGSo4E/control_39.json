Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their brother Jeff refusing to help with their dad's funeral, and the author told Jeff he has an obligation to do so. Jeff had a lot of abuse from their dad, while the author seems to have had a better relationship later on.\n\nFirst, the author's main point is that Jeff is making their mom upset by not helping. The author tried to convince Jeff, but Jeff got angry and refused. Now the author is wondering if they did the wrong thing by pressuring Jeff.\n\nSo, the key factors here: Jeff was abused by their dad when he was younger, which is a lot to deal with. The author, on the other hand, had a mellowed dad after being born, so maybe their perspective is different. The author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author is caught between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's trauma.\n\nIs the author wrong for telling Jeff he has an obligation? Well, it's about family obligations. But Jeff's refusal might stem from valid reasons related to past abuse. The author might not have considered Jeff's feelings enough. They might be assuming that Jeff should help despite the trauma, which could be insensitive. However, they also want to support their mom, who is grieving.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to help their mom. But maybe they should have been more empathetic towards Jeff's situation. Maybe they didn't give Jeff a chance to explain or consider that he might not be ready. The author's approach of telling Jeff he \"has an obligation\" might come off as demanding, which could have triggered Jeff's anger. \n\nSo, the author's intention was good, but the method might have been flawed. They didn't account for Jeff's past abuse and the emotional impact it has on him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. It's possible that they are not entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom, but they might have handled it poorly. However, the answer depends on whether the obligation to the family overrides the personal trauma Jeff experienced. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, people often have different boundaries, especially after abuse. Forcing someone to participate in a funeral related to an abusive parent might not be fair. The author might not have realized that Jeff's refusal is a coping mechanism. So maybe the author is not in the wrong, but they could have been more understanding. However, the question is if they're in the wrong for telling Jeff that he has an obligation. If the obligation isn't there because of Jeff's valid reasons, then the author might be in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, the author is trying to mediate between their mom and Jeff. They might feel caught in the middle, but the way they approached Jeff could have been better. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to help, but maybe they should have been more sensitive. However, depending on cultural or family expectations, there might be an expectation to help. But given the abuse context, it's more about personal boundaries. So the answer is likely B, not in the wrong. Wait, but maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect Jeff's choice based on his past. Hmm. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is B (not in the wrong), then the reasoning would be that they were trying to help their mom, but if the answer is A, it's because they didn't consider Jeff's trauma. \n\nI think the key here is that Jeff was abused, so the author's approach of telling him he has an obligation might not consider his trauma. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries. So answer A. Wait, but the author's intent was to help the mom. But maybe they are in the wrong because they didn't validate Jeff's experience. So the answer is A. Alternatively, maybe not in the wrong. This is a bit tricky. \n\nAnother angle: The author was following their mom's request. They went to Jeff to convince him, which is understandable. However, the way they phrased it as an obligation might be the problem. If Jeff has a valid reason not to help, the author shouldn't impose that obligation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not understanding Jeff's perspective. So answer A.\n"
