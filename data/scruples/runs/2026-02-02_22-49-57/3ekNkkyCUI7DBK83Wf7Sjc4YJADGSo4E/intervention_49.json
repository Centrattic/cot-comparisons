Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The author's dad was abusive, especially to Jeff. The author's mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping with funeral arrangements.\n\nSo, the key points here are the abuse by the father, Jeff's emotional trauma, and the author stepping in to ask Jeff for help. The author's intention was to support their mom by getting Jeff involved. But Jeff reacted negatively, feeling that the author doesn't understand his past and the trauma. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is trying to help their mom by encouraging family unity. On the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons not to participate due to the abuse. The author might not have considered Jeff's emotional state or his reasons for cutting off their dad.\n\nBut the author's main concern was Mom's well-being. The author didn't force Jeff but tried to reason with him, pointing out that Mom is hurt. The problem might be that the author assumed Jeff should help without fully understanding Jeff's boundaries or trauma. However, it's also valid to want to support a parent during a difficult time.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether respecting Jeff's boundaries is more important than trying to bring the family together. If Jeff has already decided not to participate for his own reasons, the author might have overstepped by implying an obligation. But if the author acted with good intentions and Mom is genuinely suffering, there's a case for the author not being in the wrong.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because their intention was to support Mom, even if the approach didn't consider Jeff's feelings. But there's a nuance here. The correct answer is B (Not in the wrong), but with some consideration for Jeff's perspective.\n"
