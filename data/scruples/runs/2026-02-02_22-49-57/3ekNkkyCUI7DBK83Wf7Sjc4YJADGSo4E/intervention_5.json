Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he should help with the funeral of their abusive dad. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: Their dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18, hasn't been back. Now, the dad died, and their mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him, but Jeff reacted angrily, refused to help, and the author hasn't told their mom yet.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to tell Jeff he should help. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, on one hand, the author is trying to support their mom by getting Jeff to help. On the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate because of past abuse. The author approached Jeff to mediate, which seems understandable. But did they overstep?\n\nThe author's argument is that Jeff has an obligation to help Mom. But Jeff's perspective is that he's justified in not helping due to the abuse. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to reconcile the family, but maybe they assumed Jeff had an obligation that Jeff doesn't feel. It's a sensitive situation where the author is caught between two difficult sides.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author had the right to tell Jeff he \"has an obligation.\" Maybe the author should have considered Jeff's feelings more, but given the context, trying to help Mom isn't wrong. So, likely the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
