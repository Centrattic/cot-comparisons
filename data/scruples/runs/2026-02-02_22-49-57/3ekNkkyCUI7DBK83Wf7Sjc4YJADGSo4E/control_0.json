Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral despite the abuse.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when he was drinking. Jeff left home when he turned 18 and hasn't been back. The dad later became sober and mellowed out after the author was born. Now the dad has died, and the mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him to help, but Jeff was angry and refused. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to confront Jeff.\n\nSo the key points here are: the dad's past abuse, Jeff's trauma from that abuse, the author's attempt to mediate for their mom's sake, and Jeff's refusal to participate. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author's intention was to help their mom, which seems valid. However, they might not have considered Jeff's feelings and trauma. Jeff might feel that participating in the funeral would be a betrayal of his own healing and pain. The author might have assumed that Jeff should put aside his past for the family, but that's a big ask when there's unresolved trauma and anger.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, families often have different coping mechanisms. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to support their mom, but they might have overlooked Jeff's perspective. It's possible that the author didn't give Jeff enough space to process his feelings or understand that Jeff's refusal is a valid response to his past experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's mother is grieving and might need support, and Jeff could be part of that. But Jeff's right to not want to participate is also important. The author's approach was direct and might have been confrontational, leading to Jeff's anger. Maybe a more empathetic approach would have been better, but the author's intent was to help their mom, which isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author might not be in the wrong because their intention was to support their mom, but they might have failed to consider Jeff's trauma. However, the key question is whether they were wrong for telling Jeff he has an obligation. The concept of obligation can be complex here. From a family duty perspective, there's an expectation, but from Jeff's perspective, the abuse might negate that duty. The author's mistake might be in not acknowledging that Jeff's decision is valid without trying to force him into an obligation.\n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but it's a close call. However, considering the trauma and the author's attempt to mediate, B (No) is likely the correct choice.\n"
