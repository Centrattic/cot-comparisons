Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their older brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when he was drinking. He mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been in touch. Now the dad has died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him, and Jeff got angry, refusing to help. The author is now questioning if they were wrong to tell Jeff he should help.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the dad was abusive, Jeff had a hard time, the author thinks Jeff should help for Mom's sake. But Jeff is resisting. The author's action was trying to get Jeff to help, which led to conflict.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, from the author's perspective, they're trying to help their mom. They might believe that despite the past, the family should come together. On the other hand, Jeff has legitimate reasons to be angry and might not want to participate due to the abuse. The author's statement about obligation could be seen as pressuring Jeff, who might feel that participating would be a betrayal of his feelings towards their dad.\n\nObligation can be subjective. If Jeff is not in a place where he can forgive or let go, is it fair to say he's obligated? The author might not fully understand the depth of Jeff's trauma. Telling Jeff he has an obligation might invalidate Jeff's feelings and past experiences. The author's approach might have been confrontational, which led to Jeff's anger. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to help their mom, which is a valid concern. But the method of confronting Jeff might have been inappropriate. The author could have considered other ways to approach the situation, perhaps showing empathy to Jeff's perspective first. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might not be entirely wrong because they were trying to support their mom. However, they might not have considered Jeff's emotional state and the validity of his reasons. Obligation is a heavy word here. It's possible that the author didn't realize that Jeff's refusal is a personal decision based on his experiences. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but there are nuances. However, in some interpretations, if the author was imposing their own sense of family duty without considering Jeff's trauma, they might be in the wrong. But given the context, the author's action was to help their mom, which is a family concern. \n\nI think the correct answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to mediate and support their mom, even if the approach was not perfect. The main issue is understanding the complexity of family obligations and past trauma.\n"
