Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their father's funeral, given that their dad was abusive, especially towards Jeff.\n\nFirst, the context: The dad was abusive when Jeff was younger, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't reconciled. Now, after the dad's death, the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to convince Jeff, leading to an argument.\n\nThe author's actions: They went to Jeff's place to tell him that he should help for Mom's sake. Jeff reacted angrily, refusing to participate. The author hasn't told Mom yet, feeling caught between her and Jeff.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author's intention was to support Mom's emotional needs. But Jeff's refusal is rooted in his past trauma with their father. The author might not fully understand Jeff's perspective, but they were trying to mediate. \n\nThe key points here are family obligations versus personal trauma. The author didn't force Jeff but tried to reason with him. Jeff's response was hostile, which complicates things. However, the author's action wasn't malicious; they were trying to help their mom. The question is whether they had the right to impose an obligation on Jeff. \n\nIn family matters, especially involving trauma, there's no clear right or wrong. The author might not be in the wrong because they acted out of concern for their mom. However, they might not have considered Jeff's feelings adequately. But the main point is that the author didn't do anything harmful here. They tried to facilitate communication, even though it didn't work out. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
