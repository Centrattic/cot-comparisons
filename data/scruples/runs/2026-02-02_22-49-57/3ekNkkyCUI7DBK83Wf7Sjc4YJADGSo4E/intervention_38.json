Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the narrator) is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he should help with their dad's funeral despite Jeff's past abuse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, but mellowed out after the narrator was born. Jeff left home early and hasn't had contact. Now, with the dad's death, the mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The narrator went to Jeff to convince him, and Jeff reacted angrily, refusing to help. The narrator is caught between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's reasons.\n\nThe key points here are: the dad's history of abuse, Jeff's justified anger, and the narrator's attempt to mediate for the mom's sake. The question is whether the narrator was wrong to push Jeff for help.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the narrator is trying to reconcile their family during a difficult time. The narrator isn't forcing Jeff to help, just asking him to consider their mom's feelings. Jeff's refusal is based on valid reasons\u2014his past trauma with the dad. The narrator's action is about empathy and family unity, not ignoring Jeff's pain. So, the narrator isn't in the wrong because they're acknowledging Jeff's experiences while still trying to support their mom. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
