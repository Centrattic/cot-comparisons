Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether their older brother should help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive towards Jeff, the older brother, but not so much towards the author once they were born. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused. The question is whether the author did the wrong thing by pushing Jeff to help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad was abusive to Jeff, which is a serious matter. Jeff moved out as soon as he could and has chosen not to reconnect. The author, on the other hand, had a better relationship with the dad, especially after the dad sobered up. The author is trying to mediate between Jeff and their mom, who's distressed.\n\nThe author's action was to tell Jeff he has an obligation to help with the funeral for Mom's sake. But Jeff doesn't want to help because of the abuse. Is the author wrong to push Jeff? Well, the author is trying to support their mom, which is understandable. However, Jeff's experience with their dad was traumatic. The author might not fully grasp Jeff's perspective because he wasn't subjected to the same treatment. \n\nBut the author isn't forcing Jeff; they're asking him to consider Mom's feelings. However, by framing it as an obligation, maybe the author is not respecting Jeff's personal boundaries. The key point here is whether the author had the right to impose that expectation on Jeff, given Jeff's past trauma. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to be a mediator and is concerned about their mom's emotional state. It's a tough balance. The author might not be in the wrong because they're acting out of concern for family and trying to reconcile. But are they overstepping by telling Jeff he \"has an obligation\"? Maybe. Jeff's right to disengage from the funeral is valid considering his experiences. The author's approach might have been too direct without considering Jeff's emotional state.\n\nIn the end, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they're trying to help their mom. However, the approach might have been flawed. But according to the user's initial thought, they think the author isn't wrong. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
