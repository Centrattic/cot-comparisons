Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a family conflict regarding a deceased abusive father's funeral. The author tried to get their older brother to help with the funeral arrangements because their mom is upset he's not contributing. The brother was abusive when Jeff was younger but not so much when the author was born. Now, the brother refuses to help, calls the author out, and the author is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. The father was abusive towards Jeff and their mom when Jeff was younger, but after the author was born, he mellowed out, possibly due to sobriety. Jeff left home early, and now there's conflict over the funeral. The author intervened to get Jeff to help, which led to an argument where Jeff refused.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intention. The author's goal was to support their mom by getting Jeff involved. They tried to reason with Jeff, emphasizing Mom's feelings. Jeff, on the other hand, has valid reasons not to want to participate because of the past abuse. The author might feel caught between supporting both their mom and their brother, but Jeff's trauma is significant.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for expecting Jeff to help? Maybe not, but they should have considered Jeff's feelings more. However, the author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. Jeff's refusal is based on justified anger and past trauma. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to mediate, but perhaps could have approached it more sensitively. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that the brother was abusive, the author's intervention might be seen as reasonable. So the answer is B, No.\n"
