Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their older brother Jeff he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, especially when drinking. After the narrator was born, the dad mellowed out and got sober. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back. Now the dad has died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him, but Jeff reacted angrily, refusing to help.\n\nThe author is conflicted between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's pain. They asked if they were in the wrong for confronting Jeff about this.\n\nSo, the main points are: 1) The dad was abusive in the past but improved later. 2) Jeff had a bad experience with the dad. 3) The author tried to get Jeff to help, which Jeff refused. \n\nI need to evaluate if the author's actions were wrong. The author's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable. However, Jeff's refusal is based on his traumatic experiences. The author might have assumed Jeff should help despite his feelings, but maybe they didn't consider that Jeff might not want to participate because of the abuse. \n\nIs there an obligation to help a family member's funeral even if that person was abusive? It's a cultural thing. Some might feel it's important for closure or to honor family, others might not want to participate if they had a bad relationship. The author's approach might have been to push Jeff into something he's not ready for, which could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut the author's motivation was to help their mom. However, they might not have considered Jeff's emotional state. The key is whether the author overstepped by telling Jeff he has an obligation. Obligations can be subjective. If Jeff is no longer in contact and has valid reasons to not participate, the author might be in the wrong to pressure him. \n\nAlternatively, if the author thought it's important for the family to come together, even if it's hard, they might not be wrong. But Jeff's refusal is valid. The author might have ignored Jeff's feelings and pushed for mom's sake without respecting his autonomy. \n\nIn summary, the answer depends on whether the author respected Jeff's boundaries. If they forced or guilt-tripped Jeff, they might be wrong. If they just expressed the mom's need without coercion, maybe not. The situation is complex, but Jeff's right to avoid the funeral due to past trauma might mean the author was wrong to pressure him.\n"
