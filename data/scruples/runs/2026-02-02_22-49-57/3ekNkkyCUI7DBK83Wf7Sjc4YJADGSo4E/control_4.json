Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Ask the Internet (AITA) post is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral despite their abusive past.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive towards the older brother, Jeff, especially when he was younger. The dad mellowed out after the younger sibling was born, possibly due to getting sober. The mother is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him to help for the mom's sake, which led to an argument where Jeff refused, citing the abuse.\n\nThe core question is about the author's actions. Did they overstep? Let's break it down. The author's intention was to help their mom by getting Jeff involved. They mentioned Jeff's obligation, which Jeff feels is invalid because of his past. The author might have assumed that Jeff should help despite his trauma, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's feelings or the possibility that he's not ready to reconcile.\n\nFactors to consider: The author might have a valid point that the mom is suffering and needs support from both children. However, pushing Jeff to participate in a way he's not comfortable with could be dismissive of his trauma. The author's approach might have been confrontational, saying Jeff is being a \"dick,\" which could have escalated the situation. Jeff's reaction is understandable given his history of abuse. The author's message was about obligation, but whether someone is obligated to participate in a funeral despite abuse is debatable. It's possible that the author didn't fully empathize with Jeff's perspective, leading to conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern for their mom is valid, and they might feel caught between two family members. The question is whether the author was wrong in asserting that Jeff should help. It's possible that the author wasn't in the wrong because they were trying to mediate for their mom's sake, but maybe they could have approached it differently. However, the answer might depend on the nuance of whether the obligation exists and how it's communicated.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the key is whether the person acted with good intentions but maybe the wrong approach. Here, the author's intentions might be seen as good, but the method of telling Jeff he's obligated to help without considering his trauma could be problematic. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) if the focus is on the intent, but A (Yes) if the approach was wrong. However, given that Jeff's refusal is due to legitimate reasons, the author might not be in the wrong because they were advocating for their mom's well-being, even if Jeff's refusal is justified. It's a tough call, but I think the author isn't necessarily wrong for trying to mediate, even if the approach was flawed. But in AITA terms, sometimes the line is crossed when you're imposing obligations without considering others' feelings. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the right for trying to help the mom, even if Jeff has valid reasons to refuse. The obligation part might be where the author is wrong, but the act of trying to get Jeff to help isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer could be B.\n"
