Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive towards Jeff. He was an alcoholic, physically abusive, and emotionally abusive. Jeff moved out as soon as he could and hasn't looked back. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him, saying he should help for Mom's sake. Jeff reacted angrily, saying he won't help because of the abuse. The author feels caught between mom and Jeff.\n\nSo, the main question is whether it's right to tell Jeff he has an obligation to help, given the past abuse. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nI need to consider the ethical angles. On one hand, the author tried to mediate and help their mom, which is understandable. On the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons not to participate due to the abuse. The author might not fully grasp Jeff's trauma. But was the author wrong in their approach? They didn't force Jeff, just asked him to help for Mom. Maybe the author didn't consider Jeff's boundaries. However, the obligation of family in funerals is cultural but not absolute. Since Jeff has a history of trauma, the author might have overstepped by implying obligation. But maybe it's not the author's fault for trying to help. \n\nHmm. The answer isn't clear. But the key point is whether the author's actions were wrong. Since Jeff has a valid reason to not participate, and the author didn't respect his boundaries, maybe the author is in the wrong for pushing Jeff. However, the author's intention was to help the mom. But the ethics of family obligations can be complex. In the end, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to mediate and didn't force Jeff to help beyond asking. So the answer is B.\n"
