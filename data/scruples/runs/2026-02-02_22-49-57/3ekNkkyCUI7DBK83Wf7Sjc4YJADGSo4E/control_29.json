Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for telling their brother he must help with their abusive dad's funeral. The situation is complicated because the dad was abusive, especially to Jeff, the older brother. The author tried to convince Jeff to help their mom with the funeral, but Jeff was really upset and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive when Jeff was younger, which is a serious issue. The author wasn't around during the worst of it, so maybe they don't fully grasp how bad it was. Jeff moving out early and not looking back suggests he cut ties for a reason. The author's intention was to help Mom, who's grieving and upset. But Jeff's refusal is rooted in past trauma.\n\nThe key points are: the author's right to intervene, the nature of the communication, and whether the obligation exists. The author might not realize that Jeff's trauma is valid and that forcing him to participate could be retraumatizing. However, the author is also trying to support Mom, which is understandable.\n\nIs the author wrong for expecting Jeff to help? Well, family obligations can be complex. While there's no legal obligation, emotional and moral ones are subjective. The author's approach might have been confrontational, using \"needs to contribute\" which could come off as dismissive of Jeff's feelings. The author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is a coping mechanism.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to mediate for their mom. But maybe a better approach would have been to respect Jeff's boundaries while still trying to support Mom in another way. The author's message that Jeff is a \"dick\" for not helping might be invalidating Jeff's experiences.\n\nSo, the author's intentions are good but their method might have been flawed. They didn't fully consider Jeff's perspective and the emotional impact. Therefore, the answer is more likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect Jeff's autonomy and valid feelings, even if their intention was to help Mom.\n"
