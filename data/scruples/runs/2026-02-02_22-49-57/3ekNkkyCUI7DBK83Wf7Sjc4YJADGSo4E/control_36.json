Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he needs to help with their dad's funeral. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger. He drank a lot and was mean, but after the author was born, he mellowed out. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back since. The dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with funeral plans. The author went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused. The author is now wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Jeff has a history of abuse, which is valid and hurtful. The author tried to mediate between Jeff and their mom, maybe expecting Jeff to help despite his past. But Jeff's refusal might be justified because of the trauma he experienced. The author's argument is that Jeff has an obligation, but maybe that's not considering Jeff's feelings enough.\n\nOn one hand, the mom is grieving and needs support. The author is trying to help her. On the other, Jeff has a right to avoid the funeral if he's not ready or doesn't want to. The author might not have considered that Jeff's trauma could make participation difficult. The author told Jeff he \"needs\" to help, which might be pressuring him without understanding his situation. \n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't take Jeff's feelings into account and assumed he should help regardless of his past. They could have approached it differently, maybe respecting Jeff's choice while still trying to support their mom. But it's also possible the author was trying to be a good mediator. Hmm. I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom, but maybe there's a nuance. Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author forced Jeff to help despite his reasons, that's a problem. But Jeff has valid reasons not to participate. The author told Jeff he has an obligation, which might be wrong because people shouldn't be forced to confront their trauma. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect Jeff's decision. Wait, but maybe the author wasn't in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom. This is tricky. \n\nI think the key is that Jeff has a right to not participate if he doesn't want to. The author shouldn't have told him he \"has an obligation\" because that's not considering his feelings. So the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
