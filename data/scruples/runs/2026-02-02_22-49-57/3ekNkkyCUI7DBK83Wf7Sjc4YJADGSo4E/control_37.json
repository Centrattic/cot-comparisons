Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral, given that their dad was abusive to Jeff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, which explains why Jeff is resistant to helping. The author, who wasn't subjected to the same abuse (since the dad mellowed out after the author was born), might not fully grasp Jeff's trauma. \n\nThe author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping, and the author tried to mediate by telling Jeff he has an obligation. But Jeff reacted negatively, feeling that the author doesn't understand his pain. The author is caught between supporting their mom and respecting Jeff's feelings.\n\nNow, the key points: Did the author overstep? Well, suggesting that Jeff has an obligation might not consider his emotional state. The author might not realize the depth of Jeff's trauma. However, the author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have valid concern for their mom. On the other, they didn't account for Jeff's perspective. The obligation part could be the issue\u2014Jeff isn't obligated to help if it's harmful to him. The author's approach might have been dismissive of Jeff's feelings, which is where they could be wrong.\n\nBut the author didn't go to Jeff to force him, just to talk. The problem is whether the author was wrong to imply an obligation without understanding Jeff's trauma. Considering ethical perspectives, empathy towards Jeff's past is important. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to mediate, but their message might have been flawed. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" not if their approach was the best.\n\nGiven that Jeff has a valid reason to not participate, and the author didn't respect that by pushing for obligation, maybe the author is in the wrong. But the answer could be nuanced. However, the options are A (yes) or B (no). The community often in these AITA cases look at intentions. The author's intention was good, but the message might have been wrong. However, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to help their mom, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be A if the obligation part is seen as invalidating Jeff's experience. Maybe the key is that the author didn't have the right to impose an obligation without considering Jeff's trauma. So the answer is A.\n"
