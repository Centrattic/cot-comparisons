Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with the funeral of their abusive dad. So, first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, especially when he was drinking. After the author was born, the dad apparently mellowed out and even got sober. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't had contact since. Now that the dad is dead, the author and their mom are handling the funeral. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him to be part of the funeral, saying that he's making mom sad and that he should stop being a dick. Jeff reacted angrily, saying he won't help because of the abuse and told the author to leave. The author hasn't told mom yet and is conflicted between her feelings and Jeff's reasons.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is at fault here. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants to know. Let's consider family obligations, the nature of the abuse, and the author's intent. The author's mom is grieving and wants Jeff to be part of the closure. The author tried to mediate, which is understandable. But Jeff's refusal is based on his traumatic experiences. The author might have imposed their own feelings of obligation onto Jeff, who might not feel the same. However, the author's intention was to help their mom, which is a valid concern. \n\nBut does that make the author in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. They're trying to support their mom, but they might not have considered Jeff's trauma as much as they should have. The author could have approached it differently, like understanding Jeff's perspective first rather than demanding help. But the core issue is whether the author has a right to tell Jeff to help despite Jeff's history. Since the dad was abusive, Jeff's refusal is justified. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to help, but they could be overstepping by expecting Jeff to participate if he's not willing. The key is the author's good intentions versus respecting Jeff's boundaries. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They were trying to support their mom and might not fully grasp Jeff's trauma. The author acted with intentions to help, which is a valid reason. However, there's a nuance here where the author could have been more empathetic. But in terms of being at fault, it's not their wrongdoing. Jeff's anger was likely due to the trauma, not the author's right or wrong action per se.\n"
