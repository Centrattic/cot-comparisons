Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their abusive dad's funeral. The situation involves family dynamics and past abuse.\n\nFirst, the author's brother Jeff was abused by their dad when he was younger. The dad became less abusive after the author was born. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been involved since. Now, the dad died, and the author and mom are trying to plan the funeral, but Jeff refuses to help. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him, leading to an argument where Jeff was hostile.\n\nThe author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping. The author tried to mediate, but Jeff was defensive. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are the author's intent (to help mom) versus Jeff's right to distance himself from his abusive father. The author's approach was direct, but is that wrong? \n\nJeff has valid reasons to not want to participate in the funeral given his past. The author, however, was trying to consider their mom's feelings. The author's actions were to encourage Jeff to help, not to force him. Jeff's refusal is his choice, but the author's intent was to reconcile the family, which is understandable. \n\nThe author might have assumed Jeff should help, but Jeff has the right to say no. However, the author's approach was to convey the mother's needs. Depending on cultural or family expectations, there might be an obligation, but ethically, Jeff isn't obligated if he doesn't want to. \n\nSo, the author's advice might be well-meaning, but whether they're \"in the wrong\" depends on whether they should have respected Jeff's choice without pushing. However, the author tried to mediate, which is a middle ground. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom. But Jeff's refusal is also valid. The answer is probably B (Not in the wrong) because the author's intent was to reconcile and help their mom, and they didn't force Jeff beyond the conversation.\n"
