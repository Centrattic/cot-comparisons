Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The dad was abusive towards the older brother, Jeff, but mellowed out after the younger sibling (the author) was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back. Now the dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to talk to Jeff, told him he needs to help for mom's sake, and Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the key points: The dad was abusive to Jeff, which is a serious issue. Jeff has a valid reason not to want to be involved. The author tried to convince Jeff to help Mom, but Jeff's refusal is rooted in past trauma. The author is caught between supporting Mom and understanding Jeff's perspective.\n\nIs the author wrong? They were trying to help Mom, which is understandable. But maybe they didn't consider Jeff's feelings enough. However, the author's intention was to support the mom, who's grieving. But family obligations can be complex, especially after abuse. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to mediate, but they could have approached it differently. However, since Jeff has a legitimate reason to not participate, the author might not be wrong for trying to bridge the gap, even if Jeff's response was negative.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's action was to communicate that Jeff has an obligation. But obligation can be subjective here. Since Jeff was abused, maybe there's no obligation. The author might not be wrong for trying to help Mom, but maybe they overstepped by implying obligation without considering Jeff's trauma. The answer could be B, not in the wrong, but maybe there's a nuance. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A if the author didn't respect Jeff's boundaries enough. Hmm.\n\nI think the key is that the author was trying to help their mom, which is a valid concern, and Jeff's refusal is due to past abuse. The author's action, while perhaps not perfect, is not necessarily wrong. They were trying to mediate a difficult family situation. So the answer is B.\n"
