Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive father's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive, especially to Jeff when he was younger. The author, being younger, didn't experience the same abuse. Jeff left home early and hasn't helped with the funeral planning. The mother is upset because Jeff isn't involved. The author tried to talk to Jeff, leading to a confrontation where Jeff refused to help. The author is caught between Mom and Jeff.\n\nThe key points here are about obligation and forgiveness. The author believes Jeff should help for Mom's sake, but Jeff is justified in his anger due to past abuse. Is there a moral obligation to participate in the funeral of someone who was abusive? That's a big question. \n\nLegally, there's no obligation, but morally, it's more complex. The author is trying to reconcile their brother's past with the present needs of their mother. However, Jeff's stance is understandable given his trauma. The author might have overstepped by implying obligation where there isn't one. Maybe they should have focused on Mom's feelings without pressuring Jeff. \n\nBut the author's intention was to help their mother, which is a valid concern. However, forcing someone to participate in a funeral when they have valid reasons not to could be seen as insensitive. The line between advocating for a parent and respecting family members' boundaries is thin here. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong entirely, but maybe their approach could have been better. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer might hinge on whether there's an obligation. Since there's no legal obligation, but the author's actions were to help their mom, it's a gray area. But Jeff's refusal is valid. So the author's push for obligation might be misplaced, but their concern for their mom is valid. Hmm. I'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong, because their intention was to help their mom, even if the brother's reaction was harsh. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the author should have handled it differently but isn't in the wrong.\n"
