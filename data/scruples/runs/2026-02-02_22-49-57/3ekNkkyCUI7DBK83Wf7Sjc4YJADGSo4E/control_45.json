Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. The situation involves a family with a history of abuse from their father. Jeff experienced significant abuse from their dad when he was younger, which the author acknowledges. The dad later mellowed out, especially after the author was born, but Jeff moved out and hasn't been part of the family since he turned 18. Now that the dad has died, the author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral.\n\nThe author went to Jeff's place to convince him to help, and Jeff reacted negatively, calling them an idiot and refusing to participate. The author is now conflicted, feeling empathy for both their mom and Jeff's reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were wrong. The author's intention was to help their mom by encouraging Jeff to participate in the funeral. However, Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to be involved due to the past abuse. The author might not have considered Jeff's emotional state and the trauma he's experienced. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to support their mom, which is understandable. On the other, they might have overstepped by implying that Jeff has an obligation when he has a history of being a victim. The author's approach may have been insensitive, especially without fully understanding Jeff's perspective. The key points here are empathy and communication. The author might have approached the situation without considering Jeff's feelings, leading to a hostile reaction. \n\nIn cases where there's a history of abuse, expecting someone to participate in honoring the abuser's memory can be extremely difficult. The author's brother might feel that any involvement would be a betrayal of himself and his mother, who also suffered. The author's message could have been perceived as forcing Jeff to reconcile with a painful past, which he might not be ready to do.\n\nTherefore, the author's intention was good, but the execution might have been flawed. They might have failed to acknowledge Jeff's trauma and the complexity of his feelings. It's possible that the author is not in the wrong if they were acting out of concern for their mom, but they could have handled it more sensitively. However, since Jeff has every right to decide not to participate, the author's insistence on obligation might have been misplaced. The answer would likely be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation is nuanced. However, I need to check if there's a standard for these kinds of AITA questions. Typically, if someone is pushing a family member to participate in an event related to an abusive parent when that person has a history of trauma, the push might be seen as inconsiderate. So maybe the author is in the wrong. Wait, but the mom is the one who asked the author to talk to Jeff. The author was acting on the mom's request. But Jeff's refusal is valid. The author might not be in the wrong because they were following the mom's wishes, but they should have considered Jeff's feelings. Hmm. The answer could be B (No), but with the nuance that the author's approach was perhaps not the best. Alternatively, if the author is making Jeff feel obligated despite his trauma, that could be wrong. I'm a bit torn. The key is whether the author had the right to impose that obligation. Given that Jeff has a history of abuse, the author might have been wrong to do so. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes). Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If Jeff's trauma is legitimate, then expecting him to help is wrong. So the author told Jeff he has an obligation, which might be wrong because Jeff's trauma is valid. So the author is in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries. Therefore, answer A. But I need to make sure. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer is A or B. Let me think again. The author's mom asked them to convince Jeff. The author did that, but Jeff has a valid reason to refuse. The author's message was that Jeff has an obligation, which might not be fair given Jeff's past. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's choice. So answer A. Wait, but sometimes in these scenarios, people argue that family obligations are important. However, when there's abuse involved, it's more complex. The author might not be in the wrong if they were acting on their mom's request, but the obligation part is the issue. The key is whether Jeff is under any real obligation. The author's assertion that Jeff has an obligation might be wrong because Jeff has a history of being abused. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not considering Jeff's trauma and pushing for obligation. So answer A.\n"
