Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling their older brother Jeff he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The dad was abusive to Jeff, who left as soon as he could. The author was born later, and the dad mellowed out, maybe even sobered up. Now, after the dad's death, the author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to convince him, leading to an argument where Jeff didn't want to help. The author hasn't told mom the details yet and is conflicted.\n\nSo the key points are: the dad's past abuse, Jeff's valid reasons for resentment, the author's attempt to mediate on mom's behalf, and whether the author was wrong to push Jeff to help.\n\nObligations in such situations can be complex. The author feels Jeff should help for Mom's sake, which is a valid concern. But Jeff might not see it that way, given the abuse. The author's message was that Jeff has an obligation, which Jeff rejected. The question is whether that obligation exists, and if the author was wrong in asserting it.\n\nPossible angles: \n\n1. **Moral obligation vs. personal choice**: Does Jeff have a moral duty to help, or is it okay to refuse due to past trauma? The author might think there's a duty, but Jeff's experience could justify his refusal.\n\n2. **Respecting boundaries**: Jeff might have set boundaries to protect his mental health. Forcing him to participate could be crossing that. The author's approach might have been confrontational, leading to Jeff's anger.\n\n3. **Family dynamics**: The mom is upset, and the author is trying to reconcile. But the author's message to Jeff could come off as dismissive of Jeff's feelings, especially by saying he's being a \"dick.\" That might have escalated the situation.\n\n4. **Author's intent**: The author's intention was to help the mom, which is understandable. However, the method (telling Jeff he \"needs\" to help and implying he's obligated) might not consider Jeff's perspective.\n\nIn many cases, family obligations can be seen as important, but when there's a history of abuse, it's not straightforward. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to support mom, but the way they approached Jeff could have been insensitive. Jeff's refusal is his right, and the author might have overstepped by framing it as an obligation. However, the author's concern for mom's feelings is also valid.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether asserting a \"need\" to help is wrong when the brother has a legitimate reason not to. The author's approach could have been more empathetic, but the core issue of trying to help mom isn't necessarily wrong. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong, but could have handled it better. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). The user's own thought is B, so I should see if that's justified.\n"
