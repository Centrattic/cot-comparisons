Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The dad was abusive towards Jeff, the older brother, especially when he was younger. He drank a lot, hit Jeff, yelled at the family. The author was born later, and the dad mellowed out, maybe because he got sober. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back. Now the dad is dead, and the author and mom are trying to plan the funeral but Jeff is refusing to help. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him, leading to an argument where Jeff refused to help and called the author out.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling Jeff he should help. \n\nSo, the key points here are the ethics of family obligations, especially after an abusive parent's death. The author is trying to support their mom by getting Jeff to help, but Jeff has a history of abuse from their dad. \n\nThe author's position is that Jeff has an obligation to help their mom, but Jeff feels he can't because of the abuse. The author tried to mediate, but Jeff was defensive and hostile. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The author's actions were motivated by their mom's emotional well-being. However, they didn't consider Jeff's feelings and past trauma. The author might have assumed that because the dad was less abusive to them, Jeff's experience wasn't valid or that Jeff should still help despite the history. \n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, family obligations can be complex. If someone was abused by a parent, is it fair to expect them to participate in their funeral? It's possible that Jeff's refusal is justified given his trauma. The author might have overstepped by implying an obligation without understanding Jeff's perspective. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to support their mom, which is a valid concern. However, the method of approaching Jeff might have been too direct without considering his past. The author could have been more empathetic, acknowledging Jeff's pain before asking for help. \n\nSo, the author's intention was good (helping mom) but the approach might have been flawed. They didn't take into account Jeff's justified anger and trauma. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being sensitive to Jeff's situation and pushing for help without understanding his reasons. \n\nBut wait, the author wasn't wrong for wanting to support their mom. However, the way they approached Jeff could be seen as imposing their own sense of obligation without considering the brother's unique experiences. The answer depends on whether the author's approach was respectful of Jeff's boundaries. \n\nIn the end, the author's actions led to a conflict, and they now feel caught between two family members. The key is whether they had the right to tell Jeff he needed to help. Since Jeff's refusal is based on valid reasons (abuse), the author might have been wrong to pressure him, even if their intention was to help their mom. \n\nSo the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect Jeff's boundaries and his justified refusal due to past trauma."
