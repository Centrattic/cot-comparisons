Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their abusive father's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The father was abusive to the older brother, Jeff, especially when drunk. After the younger sibling was born, the father mellowed out. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been back, probably due to the abuse. Now the father died, and Jeff won't help with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him to help for their mom's sake, but Jeff reacted angrily, refusing to participate.\n\nThe author is torn between their mom's emotional needs and Jeff's justified anger. They're asking if they're in the wrong for trying to get Jeff to help. \n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects. On one hand, Jeff has valid reasons to be angry and not want to associate with the father anymore. On the other hand, the mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping, and the author is trying to mediate. \n\nIs the author wrong for expecting Jeff to help? Well, Jeff isn't legally obligated unless there's a financial responsibility, but the question is about moral obligation. The father was abusive, so Jeff's refusal might be seen as self-preservation. The author's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable. However, forcing Jeff to participate might be invalidating his trauma. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to help their mom, but they should have considered Jeff's feelings more. Maybe there's a middle ground, like allowing Jeff to contribute in a way he's comfortable with, rather than forcing him to be involved in the funeral. \n\nBut in this case, the author directly told Jeff he's obligated to help, which Jeff might feel is unfair. The key here is whether the author had the right to impose that obligation on Jeff. Since the author is in the middle, trying to support both mom and Jeff, but Jeff's refusal is based on valid past experiences. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong. They were trying to help their mom, even though Jeff's reaction is valid. However, the approach could have been more sensitive. But the question is if they're in the wrong, and since their intention was to help a parent, which is a common family expectation, the answer is B.\n"
