Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the father was abusive towards Jeff. He drank a lot, physically abused Jeff, and was verbally abusive to both Jeff and their mom. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been back since. The author wasn't around during the worst of it, maybe because he was younger, and their dad mellowed out after the author was born. Now the dad is dead, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him to help for Mom's sake, but Jeff was angry and refused.\n\nSo the question is, did the author do the wrong thing? Let's think about obligations. The author believes Jeff has an obligation to help with the funeral. But Jeff has a history of abuse. The author might feel that even though their dad was abusive, the family should come together for the funeral, especially for the mom. But Jeff might feel that participating in the funeral could be retraumatizing or that helping the man who abused him is not something he's willing to do.\n\nThe author's intention was to help Mom by getting Jeff involved. But maybe they didn't consider Jeff's trauma. The author might be imposing their own feelings on Jeff, not recognizing that Jeff's decision not to participate is valid. The author could be in the right if they're trying to support their mom, but they could also be in the wrong if they're pressuring Jeff to confront something he's not ready for.\n\nAnother angle: family obligations vs personal healing. Jeff has the right to decide not to participate, especially given his history. The author might not fully understand the depth of Jeff's pain. By telling Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" the author might be dismissing his trauma. Obligations can be subjective. The author might not be wrong in wanting to help Mom, but they might be wrong in how they approached Jeff.\n\nAlso, the way Jeff reacted\u2014calling the author an idiot and refusing\u2014shows the severity of his feelings. The author might have been well-meaning but could have handled it differently, maybe by respecting Jeff's limits instead of pushing for participation. The key here is whether the author's actions were respecting Jeff's autonomy. If Jeff doesn't want to participate, the author shouldn't force him, even if it's for Mom's sake.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intent was to support the family, but they might have overstepped by not acknowledging Jeff's justified reasons for not wanting to be involved. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect Jeff's boundaries.\n"
