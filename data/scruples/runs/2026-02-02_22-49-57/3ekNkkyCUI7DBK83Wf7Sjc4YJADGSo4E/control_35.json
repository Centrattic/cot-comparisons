Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a family where the dad was abusive to the older brother, Jeff, but mellowed out when the narrator (let's call them the younger sibling) was born. Now the dad has died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The younger sibling went to Jeff and told him he has an obligation to help for Mom's sake. Jeff is angry and refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive, especially to Jeff. The younger sibling didn't experience that abuse, which might make it harder for them to understand Jeff's feelings. The mom is caught in the middle, grieving and upset that Jeff isn't helping. The younger sibling tried to mediate, but Jeff lashed out.\n\nThe question is whether the younger sibling is in the wrong for telling Jeff he needs to help. On one hand, the younger sibling is trying to support Mom by getting Jeff involved. On the other hand, Jeff has legitimate reasons for not wanting to participate because of the abuse. The younger sibling might not fully grasp the trauma Jeff went through, leading to the confrontation.\n\nIs the younger sibling wrong for expecting Jeff to help? Well, maybe they are in a position where they think family should support each other, but they might not realize the emotional toll the dad's behavior had on Jeff. The obligation part is tricky. Does family obligation override past trauma? Not necessarily. So the younger sibling might not be in the wrong for trying to help Mom, but perhaps they didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough.\n\nBut is it their fault? They were trying to make things better. Maybe they didn't have the right to tell Jeff he must help. Each person has their own choice in how to deal with a deceased parent, especially one who was abusive. So the younger sibling might not be in the wrong, but they could have approached it differently. However, the question is if they are in the wrong period. Since they were acting out of concern for Mom and not maliciously, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
