Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with the funeral of their abusive dad. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's father was abusive to their older brother, Jeff, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back. The father died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him, but Jeff reacted angrily, saying he won't help because of past abuse. The author is torn between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's stance.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the father was abusive, Jeff has a valid reason to distance himself, the author tried to mediate, and Jeff refused. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for urging Jeff to participate despite his valid reasons.\n\nThe author's intention was to help their mom by getting Jeff involved. But Jeff has a history of abuse and might not want to participate because of that. Is it right to push someone to participate in a funeral when they have reasons not to? The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom, but they need to consider Jeff's feelings. However, the author might have overstepped by implying obligation without considering Jeff's boundaries.\n\nBut from the story, the author did explain Mom's distress and acknowledged Jeff's perspective. However, Jeff's response was hostile, suggesting he felt pressured. The author's action might be seen as trying to help, but maybe they should have focused more on Mom's feelings without making Jeff feel forced. But Jeff's refusal is also valid given his past. So the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to mediate, but maybe they could have approached it differently. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to help and had good intentions, even if the outcome was tense.\n"
