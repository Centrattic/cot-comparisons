Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, especially when he was drinking. The author wasn't around as much when the abuse happened and their dad mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back. The dad died recently, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to talk to Jeff, told him he needs to help for Mom's sake, and Jeff got angry, saying he won't help because of the dad's past.\n\nSo the key points here are the history of abuse, Jeff's justified anger and refusal to participate, and the author's attempt to make Jeff feel obligated to help. The question is whether the author was wrong to push Jeff in this situation.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, Jeff has a valid reason not to help. The dad was abusive to him, and it's reasonable for Jeff to cut ties. The author might think they're helping Mom by getting Jeff involved, but forcing someone to participate in a funeral for someone who harmed them could be harmful. The author's mom might not fully understand the extent of the abuse or Jeff's trauma, which complicates things.\n\nThe author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable, but they didn't consider Jeff's perspective and feelings. The author might not realize that Jeff has the right to refuse. Obligations in such cases are complex. Family obligations can be important, but they shouldn't override someone's mental health and well-being, especially after trauma.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was assuming Jeff has an obligation without acknowledging Jeff's right to distance himself from the abusive father. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect Jeff's boundaries and reasons for refusing. However, the author was trying to help their mom, which is a good intention, but perhaps the approach was flawed.\n\nI need to decide if the author is wrong. The key is whether the author had the right to tell Jeff he must help. Since Jeff has a valid reason to refuse, the author might be wrong in pressuring him. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect Jeff's decision and his past trauma.\n"
