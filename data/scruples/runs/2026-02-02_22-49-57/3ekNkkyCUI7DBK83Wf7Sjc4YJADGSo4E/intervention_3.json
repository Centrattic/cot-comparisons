Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the brother, Jeff, should help with their father's funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to ask him to help their mom by contributing, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Their dad was abusive towards Jeff, especially when he was drinking. The dad mellowed out after the author was born, but that doesn't take away the past trauma Jeff experienced. The author knows about this because their mom shared stories. Jeff moved out as soon as he could, which makes sense given the environment he was in.\n\nThe author tried to mediate between their mom and Jeff. They went to Jeff's house to convince him to help with the funeral. The author's intention was to support their mom, who's upset because Jeff isn't helping. But Jeff's reaction was strong\u2014he called the author an idiot, said he wouldn't help, and told them to leave. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to confront Jeff. The author's main point was that Jeff has an obligation to help with the funeral for their mom's sake. But Jeff's refusal is rooted in his past with their father. From a moral standpoint, does Jeff have an obligation to help despite the abuse? Obligations can be complex. Families often have expectations, but personal trauma can affect someone's willingness to participate in events related to an abusive parent.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom. However, they may not have considered Jeff's perspective deeply enough. Jeff's refusal is a valid response to his history. The author might have approached the conversation without enough empathy for Jeff's feelings, which could have led to the confrontation.\n\nBut the author did mention understanding Jeff's reasons. Still, by stating that Jeff \"has an obligation,\" they might have dismissed Jeff's justified feelings. The key here is whether the obligation exists regardless of past abuse. If Jeff's trauma is significant, then the author might have been wrong to insist on that obligation without acknowledging Jeff's valid reasons.\n\nIn summary, the author's intent was to help their mom, but the way they framed the request (focusing on obligation) might have been insensitive to Jeff's experiences. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not fully respecting Jeff's boundaries based on his history.\n"
