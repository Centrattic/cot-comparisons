Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother he should help with their abusive father's funeral. The situation is that their dad was abusive to the brother, especially when drinking, but mellowed out after the author was born. The brother left home at 18 and hasn't been back. Now that the dad has died, the mom is upset because the brother isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to talk to the brother, urging him to help for the mom's sake, but the brother got angry and refused.\n\nSo the question is, is the author wrong for doing that? The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the father was abusive. The brother had a terrible experience with him, so maybe he has valid reasons to not want to participate. The author tried to mediate between mom and brother, but the brother felt attacked. The author's intention was to help the mom, but the brother's trauma might not be acknowledged enough.\n\nThe author might be in a tough spot because they care about both family members. However, the brother's refusal is a result of past trauma. The author's approach might have been confrontational, making the brother defensive. The author told the brother he has an obligation, which might not consider the brother's feelings. But the author also tried to explain the mom's distress, which is valid.\n\nIs the author wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author's intention was good, but maybe they didn't take into account the brother's perspective. However, the brother's response was harsh. The author tried to bridge a gap between mom and brother but didn't succeed. The question is whether the author had the right to push the brother. Since the father was abusive, maybe the brother isn't obligated to help. The author might have overstepped by imposing an obligation. But the author was trying to help the mother, so their intentions were good.\n\nHmm. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom, but maybe they could have approached it more sensitively. However, the main issue is that the brother has a right to distance himself due to past abuse. So maybe the author isn't wrong, but the brother's reaction is also understandable. The key is that the author's push for obligation might not consider the brother's trauma, but the author's intent was to help the mom. So the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
