Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he should help with their dad's funeral. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, especially when he was drinking. Jeff left home at 18, and the dad mellowed out after the author was born. The author isn't sure if Jeff's memories are accurate, but they do mention that their mom confirmed some of the abuse. The dad died, and now they're trying to plan the funeral. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him, and Jeff reacted angrily, saying he won't participate. The author is now torn between helping their mom and understanding Jeff's perspective.\n\nThe key points here are the duty to family versus personal trauma. Jeff had a really bad experience with their dad, so his refusal might be justified. The author's mom is suffering, which adds pressure to involve Jeff. But is the author wrong for expecting Jeff to contribute, especially for the mom's sake?\n\nI need to consider if the author has the right to push Jeff to participate. The author's intention was to help their mom, but Jeff's trauma might make that impossible. The author might not fully grasp the extent of Jeff's pain. On the other hand, the mom is grieving and needs support. However, forcing Jeff into the funeral could cause more harm. The author's approach was confrontational, which might have escalated the situation. Maybe a softer approach or respecting Jeff's decision would be better.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe their approach was heavy-handed. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong for expecting Jeff to help. Since Jeff has valid reasons to not participate, the author's expectation might be unreasonable. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author had good intentions to help their mom, but the situation is complex. However, if the author should have respected Jeff's choice without trying to convince him, then maybe A. Hmm. I think it's more about the context. The author isn't wrong for wanting to help their mom, but the way they approached Jeff might have been an issue. However, the core question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling Jeff he should contribute. Given Jeff's trauma, maybe the author isn't wrong. So B.\n"
