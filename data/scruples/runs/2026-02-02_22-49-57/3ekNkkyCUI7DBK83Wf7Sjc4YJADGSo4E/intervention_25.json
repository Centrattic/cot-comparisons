Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. So the situation is that their dad was abusive, especially to Jeff. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been back. The dad died, and the author and mom are trying to plan the funeral, but Jeff isn't helping. The author went to Jeff to convince him, told him he should help for mom's sake, and Jeff reacted angrily, refusing to help.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me break this down. The author's intention was to help mom by getting Jeff involved. But Jeff has a history of abuse from their dad. So, is it right to expect Jeff to help with the funeral? The author might feel they're supporting mom, but Jeff has valid reasons to be upset.\n\nIn cases like this, it's important to consider the trauma Jeff experienced. The author might not fully understand the depth of Jeff's feelings. The author's approach might have been confrontational, telling Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" which could come off as dismissive of his experiences. Obligation vs. personal choice here. Jeff's refusal is a personal boundary based on his past. So, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they're trying to help mom, but they could have approached it differently, respecting Jeff's wishes more.\n\nBut is the author wrong? If you tell someone they have an obligation to help with a funeral of someone who was abusive to them, maybe that's pushing too hard. The author might not realize that Jeff's trauma is a legitimate reason to not participate. So the author's intention is good, but the method is questionable. However, the question is about being in the wrong. The author isn't necessarily wrong because they're trying to support mom, but they might not have considered Jeff's perspective enough. But the answer here is whether they're in the wrong. Since the author's actions were based on wanting to help mom, and Jeff's refusal is justified, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B (No).\n"
