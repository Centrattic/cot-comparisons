Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author encouraging their older brother, Jeff, to help with their dad's funeral despite Jeff's past abuse. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The dad was abusive towards Jeff, especially when drinking. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back, while the author was born later and didn't experience the same level of abuse. Now that the dad is dead, the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house and told him he has an obligation to help for Mom's sake. Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's actions and the context. The author tried to convince Jeff to participate in the funeral, which Jeff is against because of his past with the dad. The author's intention was to help Mom, but Jeff feels justified in his refusal due to the abuse.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The author isn't forcing Jeff, just suggesting he should help. The author might not fully understand Jeff's trauma. But the author is trying to mediate between Jeff and Mom. Is it wrong to ask a sibling to help in a family matter, even if they have a strained relationship?\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to attend a funeral, so the author isn't making Jeff do anything. However, morally, it's about family dynamics. The author's perspective is that Mom is suffering, and Jeff should reconcile for her. But Jeff has valid reasons to cut ties. The author might have overstepped by implying an obligation, not considering Jeff's feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to support Mom. The question is whether the author was wrong in advising Jeff to help. Since the author isn't forcing Jeff, but urging him for Mom's sake, maybe it's not entirely wrong. Jeff's reaction shows the sensitivity of the situation. The author's actions are well-intentioned but perhaps didn't account for Jeff's trauma. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong but could have approached it differently. But the answer depends on the context of obligations and family roles.\n"
