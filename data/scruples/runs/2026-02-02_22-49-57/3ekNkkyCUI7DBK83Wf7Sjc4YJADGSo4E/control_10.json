Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, which Jeff clearly remembers. He moved out at 18 and hasn't been in contact since. The author, on the other hand, had a better experience because the dad mellowed out after their birth. Now, the dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place to tell him he should help for Mom's sake, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Jeff's past with their dad, the author's different experience, the mom's emotional state, and the author's attempt to mediate.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to ask Jeff to help. From a moral standpoint, each person has different boundaries. Jeff might feel that supporting the funeral of someone who was abusive to him is not something he's willing to do. The author is trying to help their mom, which is understandable, but they might not fully grasp Jeff's trauma.\n\nHowever, the author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to support their mom's wishes. But they could be overstepping by imposing their own expectations on Jeff, especially if they don't share the same history with their dad. It's possible that the author didn't consider Jeff's feelings and boundaries enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that they were acting out of concern for their mom. But Jeff's refusal is valid given his past. The author might not be wrong, but they could have approached the situation differently, maybe by letting the mom handle it or discussing it more with Jeff about his feelings first.\n\nIn terms of obligation, there's no legal requirement here. It's a matter of family dynamics and personal choice. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to help, but they might not have the right to demand Jeff's participation. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the intent was good, but the execution could be questioned. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. Since Jeff's refusal is valid, the author's push might be seen as wrong. Hmm, this is tricky.\n\nWait, the key is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions were to tell Jeff he had an obligation. If Jeff doesn't feel that obligation, the author might be assuming Jeff's feelings. But the author is in a position where they want to help their mom. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author's intent was to support the mom, but it's a gray area. Alternatively, maybe A (in the wrong) because they didn't respect Jeff's boundaries. I think the correct answer is B because the author isn't necessarily wrong for trying to help, but the situation is complex. However, some might argue that the author should have respected Jeff's choice without pushing. I'm a bit torn here. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and the author's intentions were good, even if the approach could be better, the answer might be B.\n"
