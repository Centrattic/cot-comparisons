Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The brother, Jeff, had a really bad experience with their dad\u2014abuse, drinking, all that. The author went to Jeff and told him he needed to help with the funeral for their mom's sake. Jeff flipped out and refused.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the wrong thing. Let me break this down. The dad was abusive to Jeff, which is a serious issue. Jeff moved out early and hasn't been in contact, which makes sense given the trauma. The author thinks Jeff should help with the funeral, but Jeff is clearly hurt and angry. The author tried to mediate, but Jeff didn't take it well.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to support their mom, who's upset. It's natural to want the family to come together, especially for a funeral. But on the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons not to participate. The author might not fully understand Jeff's trauma. Telling someone they \"have an obligation\" to help after such abuse could be insensitive. Obligations can be tricky here\u2014maybe the author should have framed it as a request rather than a duty. Also, the author might not have considered Jeff's emotional state. \n\nBut then, the author's intention was to help their mom. They might not be aware of the depth of Jeff's pain. It's a tough situation. The author isn't wrong for wanting family unity, but maybe the approach was off. However, since the author didn't force Jeff and just communicated their mom's feelings, maybe they're not in the wrong. The key is that the author tried to bridge the gap, even if Jeff reacted negatively. So, the answer is probably B, not in the wrong.\n"
