Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with the funeral of their abusive dad. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's dad was abusive, especially to their older brother Jeff. Jeff left home when he was 18, and the dad mellowed out after the author was born. Now the dad has died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff reacted angrily and refused to help. The author is now conflicted about whether they were right to push Jeff.\n\nSo, the key points here: The dad was abusive to Jeff, which is a significant reason why Jeff doesn't want to participate. The author is trying to help their mom by getting Jeff involved, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. However, the dad's abuse is real, and Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate. By making Jeff feel obligated, the author might be ignoring his trauma. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is caught between their mom's needs and Jeff's feelings. But does that make the author wrong? Well, pushing Jeff to participate in a funeral for someone who hurt him might be invalidating his feelings. The author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is about his own healing and boundaries. \n\nSo, maybe the author didn't handle it the best way. They should have approached it with more empathy, understanding Jeff's trauma. But is that making them wrong? It's a tough spot. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the intention was to help the mom, but maybe A (in the wrong) because they forced Jeff's hand without considering his trauma. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B, not in the wrong, because the author was trying to mediate and help their mom. However, they could have approached it differently. But the question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether they handled it perfectly. Since Jeff had valid reasons for refusing, maybe the author isn't wrong. The obligation to help a funeral isn't universal, especially after abuse. So the author's push might be misplaced. But the answer depends on whether the obligation exists. If the author believed it was an obligation, but Jeff has a right to set boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but they could have been more understanding.\n"
