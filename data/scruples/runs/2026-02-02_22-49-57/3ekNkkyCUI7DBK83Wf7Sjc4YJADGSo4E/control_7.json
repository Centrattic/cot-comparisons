Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their older brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, but after the author was born, the dad mellowed out, maybe because he got sober. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been in touch. Now, their dad died, and their mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for expecting Jeff to help? Well, the author's intention was to help their mom, which makes sense. But Jeff has a history of being abused by the dad. The question is about whether the author had the right to pressure Jeff despite his past trauma.\n\nFrom one side, the author is trying to support their mom, which is a valid concern. However, Jeff's refusal might be rooted in his traumatic experiences with their dad. The author might not fully grasp the extent of Jeff's pain, especially since he was the one who experienced the abuse. \n\nObligations can be cultural or family expectations, but in this case, Jeff's well-being and his right to disengage from someone who was abusive might be important factors. The author might be projecting their own experience of the dad as more positive (since he mellowed for them) onto Jeff's situation. \n\nAlso, the author called Jeff out for being a \"dick,\" which might have been hurtful. The way they approached Jeff could have been confrontational, leading to Jeff's anger. But the root issue is whether Jeff is obligated to help despite the abuse. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom. However, they might not have considered Jeff's emotional state and history properly. But the question is if they're in the wrong for telling Jeff he has an obligation. Ethically, it's complicated. The obligation might not be there if Jeff hasn't been involved, especially after moving out and having traumatic experiences. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the author respected Jeff's autonomy. The author's intention was good, but the expectation might be unfair given Jeff's history. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong for trying to mediate, but maybe the approach was flawed. However, the question is about being in the wrong for asserting the obligation. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They were trying to help their mom, even if Jeff's response was harsh. The obligation could be seen as a family responsibility, but the author's actions stem from a place of wanting to support their mother. So, the author isn't necessarily at fault here.\n"
