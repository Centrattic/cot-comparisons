Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether the older brother, Jeff, should help with the funeral of their abusive dad. The author, who's the younger sibling, went to Jeff and told him he has an obligation to help, which led to Jeff getting angry and refusing to help.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. Jeff was abused by their dad when he was younger, moved out as soon as he could. The dad later mellowed out, maybe because of sobriety, and treated the author better. Now the dad's died, and Mom wants Jeff to be involved in the funeral, but Jeff is refusing. The author tried to convince Jeff, which backfired.\n\nThe key points here are about obligation. The author told Jeff he has an obligation to help. But Jeff was a victim of abuse, which is a significant factor. Should someone who was abused feel obligated to participate in the funeral of the abuser? That's a sensitive issue. The author might not fully understand Jeff's trauma because he wasn't treated the same way. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to support their mom, who's upset. On the other hand, forcing Jeff to participate in something that might retraumatize him could be wrong. The author's approach was to tell Jeff he \"needs to contribute,\" which might not consider Jeff's emotional state. Instead of respecting Jeff's autonomy, the author is imposing their own expectations based on their limited understanding of Jeff's experience.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author overstepped. The author might not be in the wrong if they were trying to help their mom, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. However, Jeff's refusal is valid given his history. The author's obligation argument might not hold because obligations can be personal and emotional, not just familial. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might be in the wrong because they pressured Jeff without understanding his trauma. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect Jeff's boundaries and his valid reasons for not participating. Alternatively, if the author's intention was purely to help their mom, maybe they're not in the wrong. But I think the key is that the author didn't acknowledge Jeff's pain and instead made it about obligation, which is hurtful. So likely answer is A.\n"
