Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with the funeral of their abusive father. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The father was abusive towards Jeff, especially when he was drinking. The author wasn't around during that time as much since they were younger, and the father mellowed out after their birth. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back, which makes sense given the abuse. Now, after the father's death, the mother is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to talk to Jeff about it, but Jeff reacted angrily, refusing to help.\n\nThe author is caught between their mother's feelings and Jeff's justified anger. So, the key points here are the history of abuse, the author's attempt to mediate, and Jeff's refusal.\n\nLegally or morally, does Jeff have an obligation to help with the funeral? Well, family obligations can be complex. If Jeff hasn't had contact with the father for years and the father was abusive, Jeff might not feel a moral obligation to help. The author might be assuming Jeff should help for the mother's sake, but Jeff's trauma could make him resistant. \n\nThe author's action was to confront Jeff, which could be seen as trying to support their mother, but they might not have considered Jeff's perspective or the extent of the abuse. However, the author's intention was to help their mother, which is understandable. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on context. They might not be, because they were trying to support their mother. But they could have been more empathetic to Jeff's situation. However, since Jeff was abusive, the author's demand for help might have been reasonable in the context of wanting to support their mother. \n\nWait, but the author didn't force Jeff; they just asked him to help. The problem is that Jeff's trauma makes it hard for him to participate. The author might not have the right to demand participation in the funeral if Jeff's mental health is a concern. So, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they were trying to help their mother, but also Jeff's right to distance himself from the situation is valid. \n\nIn the end, it's a tough balance. The author's action was to mediate, but Jeff's refusal is also valid. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to help, but maybe could have approached it differently. Since the options are A or B, and the question is if the author is in the wrong, the answer would be B, not in the wrong, because their intention was good and Jeff's refusal is due to past trauma. The author isn't wrong for trying to support their mother, even if Jeff's response was harsh.\n"
