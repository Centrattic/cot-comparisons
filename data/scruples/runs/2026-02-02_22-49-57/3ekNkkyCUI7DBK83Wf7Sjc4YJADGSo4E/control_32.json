Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive towards Jeff, but not the author. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him to help their mom with the funeral arrangements, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the key points here are about obligation, family dynamics, and the impact of past abuse. The author thinks Jeff should help for their mom's sake, but Jeff is clearly hurt and angry because of his past experiences. The author might be in a tough spot trying to balance their mom's needs with Jeff's feelings.\n\nFirst, does someone have an obligation to help with a funeral of someone who was abusive to them? Legally, maybe not, but emotionally or culturally, it depends. The author's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable. But Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate. The author might not fully grasp the trauma Jeff went through, especially since the dad was abusive when Jeff was young.\n\nThe author's approach was to tell Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" which could come off as dismissive of Jeff's feelings. Instead of being empathetic, the author might have framed it as a duty, which Jeff resented. Telling someone they \"need to contribute\" when they have a history of trauma might not be the right approach. Respecting Jeff's boundaries would be important here.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to help their mom, which is a good motive. They might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is rooted in deep emotional pain. The author could have approached the situation with more understanding, perhaps by acknowledging Jeff's past and offering alternatives without forcing participation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of both. They had good intentions but might have mishandled the situation. The answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for trying to help their mom, but their approach could have been better. However, depending on the perspective, if the author should have respected Jeff's choice from the start, then maybe A (Yes). But since the question is binary, and the author's main action was trying to mediate between mom and Jeff, the answer leans towards B.\n"
