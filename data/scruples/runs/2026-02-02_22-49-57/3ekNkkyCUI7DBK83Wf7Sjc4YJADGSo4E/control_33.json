Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with the funeral of their abusive dad.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive when the brother Jeff was younger, but mellowed out when the author was born. Jeff left home at 18, the dad became sober, and now he's passed away. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused. The question is whether the author was wrong to do that.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the dad was abusive, Jeff had a bad experience, and the author is trying to help mom by getting Jeff involved. The author's argument is that Jeff should help for mom's sake, even though he has reasons not to. \n\nOn one hand, the author might be seen as respecting their mom's emotional needs, trying to include all family. On the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate due to past abuse. The author might not fully understand Jeff's trauma. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author's intention was to help their mom by involving Jeff. But maybe they didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. However, they were trying to mediate a family situation. The brother's refusal is his choice, so the author isn't wrong for trying to convince him, especially if they believed in their mom's well-being. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. But since Jeff is refusing due to his past trauma, the author might not be in the wrong for trying to encourage participation, but perhaps could have approached it more sensitively. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural expectations about family obligations. In some contexts, family members are expected to help with funerals regardless of past issues. \n\nAlternatively, the author might not be wrong because they were acting in their mom's interest. Jeff's refusal is his choice, but the author isn't obligated to make him help if he doesn't want to. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is B (No), because the author was trying to support their mom and didn't force Jeff. Maybe they could have handled it better, but they aren't in the wrong for making a genuine effort.\n"
