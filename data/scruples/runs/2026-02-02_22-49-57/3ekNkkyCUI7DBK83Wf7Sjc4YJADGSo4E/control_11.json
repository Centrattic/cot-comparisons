Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their abusive dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother, Jeff, had a bad experience with their dad\u2014abuse when he was young. The author, the other sibling, didn't experience the same level of abuse and now wants Jeff to help with the funeral. Jeff is refusing, and the author told him he should help for their mom's sake. Jeff reacted angrily and refused.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. But Jeff has a valid reason not to want to help because of the abuse. The author might not have considered Jeff's trauma as much as they should have. However, the author was trying to mediate between Jeff and their mom. \n\nThe key points are: the author's intent was good, but maybe they didn't approach it sensitively. Jeff's refusal is based on past trauma, so the author might not have the right to demand his participation. The author might have overstepped by telling Jeff he has an obligation, not considering Jeff's feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to support their mom, which is also a valid concern. But forcing someone to participate in a funeral for someone who abused them could be harmful. \n\nSo, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom, but they might have handled it poorly. However, the question is if they're in the wrong. Since Jeff has a right to his boundaries and the author might not have respected that enough, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but I need to check again.\n\nWait, the options are A for yes (author is wrong) and B for no. If the author is not wrong, then B. The author's action was to tell Jeff he has an obligation, but Jeff's refusal is due to valid reasons. So the author might not be in the wrong because they were acting on their mother's behalf, but they might have been wrong to impose on Jeff's choice. Hmm. It's a tricky balance. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom, but they could have approached it better. So answer B.\n"
