Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their older brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. The situation involves an abusive father, and Jeff had a bad experience with him, while the author was treated better. The mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral, and the author tried to convince him but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, but mellowed out after the author was born, especially after getting sober. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been involved since. The author, now being 13 when Jeff left, had a better relationship with their dad. The author told Jeff he should help with the funeral for their mom's sake, but Jeff rejected and the author hasn't informed the mom yet.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible angles here are family obligations, the right to refuse participation in a funeral, and the author's role in mediating between Jeff and their mom.\n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation that family members will help with funeral arrangements, especially for a parent. However, if someone has been a victim of abuse, their right to set boundaries is often considered valid. The author tried to convince Jeff, which could be seen as well-intentioned, wanting to support their mom. But Jeff's refusal might be based on his traumatic experiences.\n\nThe author's actions: approaching Jeff to ask for help, and implying he has an obligation. The issue is whether the author should have pushed Jeff to participate despite his past trauma. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom, but they might not have considered Jeff's feelings and right to disengage. However, the author was honest about their father's later behavior and the mom's distress. The author's message could be perceived as invalidating Jeff's feelings, but maybe not, if the author acknowledged that the past was hard for him.\n\nAlso, the author didn't force Jeff but asked him to help. The obligation part might be a cultural expectation, but Jeff's experience could make him feel no obligation. The author's approach might have been too direct, not considering Jeff's trauma. So maybe the author is partially in the wrong for not being more empathetic.\n\nBut the user's perspective is that the author isn't in the wrong. The user might believe that family obligations outweigh past trauma. However, in modern times, people often respect others' choices to disassociate from abusive family members. \n\nSo, the answer depends on balancing family expectations with individual emotional well-being. The author tried to mediate, but perhaps the way they framed it (obligation) was the problem. They might not be in the wrong for wanting to help their mom, but could have approached it differently. However, the question is about being in the wrong at all. Since Jeff has the right to say no, the author's insistence might not be justified. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but could have been more understanding. The main issue is whether the author had the right to tell Jeff he has an obligation. If the author was asserting that obligation without considering Jeff's trauma, perhaps that's where the mistake is. But if the author was trying to facilitate a family discussion, then maybe not. The answer is likely B, not in the wrong, but with a caveat that the approach could have been more sensitive.\n"
