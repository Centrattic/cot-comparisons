Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nSo, the author's dad was abusive to their older brother, Jeff, especially when he was drinking. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back. Now, after the dad's death, the author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to talk to Jeff, told him he should help for Mom's sake, and Jeff got angry, refused, and told the author to leave. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to confront Jeff about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. But Jeff has a history of trauma from his father. The author might not fully grasp the depth of Jeff's feelings, especially since he had a worse experience. Forcing someone to participate in a funeral of someone who was abusive could be seen as insensitive.\n\nThe key points here: Did the author have the right to pressure Jeff? The author's mom is upset, but Jeff's emotional well-being and past trauma are also important. The author might not have considered that Jeff might not want to engage with the funeral at all. Maybe the author should have approached it differently, like finding a compromise or letting Jeff decide without guilt-tripping.\n\nAlso, the author didn't force Jeff but tried to convince him, leading to an argument. Jeff's reaction shows he's still hurt, so the author's approach might have been too direct. However, trying to mediate a family conflict isn't inherently wrong. The author's fault could be in assuming Jeff must help, without respecting his boundaries.\n\nIn terms of obligations, there's no legal obligation for Jeff to help, but family dynamics are tricky. The author's position is between supporting mom and respecting Jeff's wishes. The rightness or wrongness might depend on the context of their family and how Jeff's feelings were addressed. If the author pressured Jeff without considering his past, that's where they might be in the wrong. So, the answer could be AITA, meaning the author is a bit in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries, even with good intentions.\n"
