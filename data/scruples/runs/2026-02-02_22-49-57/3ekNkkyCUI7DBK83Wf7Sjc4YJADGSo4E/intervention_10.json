Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff to help with their dad's funeral. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when he was drinking. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't looked back. The author was born after the dad started mellowing out, so they didn't experience the same abuse. Now the dad has died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral planning. The author went to Jeff to convince him to help, which led to an argument where Jeff refused.\n\nThe author is trying to balance their mother's feelings with Jeff's justified anger. They told Jeff he has an obligation to help, which Jeff took as an insult, leading to a confrontation. The question is whether the author was wrong to do that.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. They might feel that family should come together, even after past issues. On the other hand, Jeff has every right to be angry and might not want to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive. The author might not fully grasp the extent of Jeff's trauma, especially since the dad was abusive to him specifically.\n\nBut is it the author's place to tell Jeff what to do? The author's mom asked them to talk to Jeff, so they were acting as a mediator. However, the author framed it as an obligation, which Jeff took as a demand. Maybe the author should have approached it more gently, acknowledging Jeff's feelings and perhaps suggesting options rather than insisting on obligation. But the author's actions were to help their mom, which is a valid concern.\n\nJeff's reaction is also important. If he's not ready to participate, forcing him could cause more harm. The author might not realize that their approach could be triggering for Jeff. So maybe the method was wrong, but the intention was good. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If the author's actions were well-meaning but perhaps not sensitive, does that make them in the wrong? Or is the author justified in trying to support their mom?\n\nI think the key here is the balance between family obligations and personal trauma. The author might not be in the wrong because their intention was to help their mom, but they might have mishandled the situation by not considering Jeff's emotional state. However, the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong for stating that Jeff has an obligation. Since Jeff was abusive, the author's assertion might not hold, especially if Jeff doesn't feel that obligation. So maybe the author is in the wrong for assuming Jeff must help, not considering his past experiences. Alternatively, if the author was trying to be a good mediator, but failed to be empathetic, they might be partially at fault.\n\nBut the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me check again. The author was told by their mom to convince Jeff. The author did that, and Jeff reacted negatively. The author is now stuck between both. The question is whether the author was wrong to tell Jeff he has an obligation. Since Jeff was abused, it's possible that the author is not in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom, even if the approach was flawed. Alternatively, maybe they are in the wrong because they didn't respect Jeff's boundaries. Hmm. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author's intention was to help their mom, and they weren't aware of the full extent of Jeff's trauma. But maybe they should have been more understanding. Still, the question is about being in the wrong, and the author's actions, while perhaps not the best approach, were driven by a desire to help their mother, so they might not be in the wrong. So I lean towards B.\n"
