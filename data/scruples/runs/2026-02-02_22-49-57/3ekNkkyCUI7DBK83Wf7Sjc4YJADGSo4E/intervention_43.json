Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's dad was abusive to their older brother, Jeff, especially when he was drinking. The dad got sober after the author was born, and Jeff moved out when he was 18. Now, the dad has died, and the author is trying to get Jeff to help with the funeral, but Jeff is refusing and even got angry.\n\nThe author went to Jeff's place to talk to him, explained that Mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping, and said Jeff needs to stop being a \"dick to mom.\" Jeff responded angrily, accusing the author of not understanding his pain and refusing to help. The author hasn't told Mom yet and is conflicted between supporting her and respecting Jeff's feelings.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key points are the obligation to help with the funeral and the approach taken. In many cultures, there's an expectation that family members help with funerals, especially if they're close. However, Jeff's experience with the father is traumatic. The author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. \n\nBut Jeff's right to be upset isn't being acknowledged. The author might have assumed Jeff should help regardless of his past, which could be dismissive of his trauma. The author's message to Jeff was that he \"needs to contribute,\" implying some obligation. That could come off as judgmental, not empathetic. \n\nThe author's mom is dealing with grief and might be struggling without Jeff's help. The author is trying to mediate, but the way they approached Jeff might have been too direct or not sensitive enough. Jeff's anger suggests he felt pressured and misunderstood. \n\nHowever, the author also mentions they left when Jeff got angry, not escalating the situation. They might not have realized that the obligation they're placing on Jeff ignores his justified feelings. So while the author's intent was good, the approach might not have considered Jeff's emotional state and the history of abuse. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong,\" but their message could be seen as insensitive. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nConsidering the context, the author's actions are well-meaning but could be seen as overstepping, especially assuming Jeff has an obligation to help with a funeral for someone who was abusive. So maybe the answer is B (no), but the reasoning is that the author is not in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom, even if the approach wasn't the best. However, some might argue they should have been more understanding of Jeff's stance. \n\nAlternatively, the author might be in the right because they are fulfilling their mom's request, and it's common to expect family involvement. But Jeff's refusal is based on valid reasons. So, the author isn't in the wrong, but could have approached it differently. The answer is B.\n"
