Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he should help with the funeral of their abusive father. \n\nFirst, the context: The father was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, but became mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff moved out at 18, hasn't been in contact, and now refuses to help with the funeral. The mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping, and the author went to Jeff to convince him.\n\nThe author's main point is that Jeff has an obligation to help with the funeral for Mom's sake. But Jeff reacts angrily, citing his past abuse. The question is whether the author was wrong to push Jeff.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is trying to support their mother by getting Jeff involved. However, Jeff's refusal is based on his traumatic experiences. The author might not have considered Jeff's emotional state and his right to distance himself from his father's memory. \n\nObligations in such situations are complex. While there's a cultural or familial expectation to contribute to a parent's funeral, it's also important to respect personal boundaries and trauma. The author might be assuming Jeff has to participate without acknowledging his valid reasons for not wanting to. \n\nThe author's approach might have been confrontational, using \"needs to stop being such a dick,\" which could have escalated tensions. Instead of pushing, maybe a more empathetic approach, acknowledging Jeff's pain and offering support, would have been better. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to help their mother, which is understandable. The key issue is whether the author respected Jeff's autonomy and trauma. By asserting an obligation without considering Jeff's feelings, the author might have overstepped. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on balancing family expectations with individual trauma. The author's actions could be seen as well-meaning but misguided, not entirely their fault, but perhaps in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries. But ultimately, it's a nuanced situation where both parties have valid points. However, given the options, B (not in the wrong) might be more appropriate because the author was trying to help their mother, even if their approach had flaws.\n"
