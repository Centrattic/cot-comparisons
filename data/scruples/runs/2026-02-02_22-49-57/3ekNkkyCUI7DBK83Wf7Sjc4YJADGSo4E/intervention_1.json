Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for telling their older brother he should help with their dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive to the brother, Jeff, especially when he was drinking. The author wasn't there for that, but Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been involved since. Now, the dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to convince him, and Jeff got angry, saying he won't help because of the past abuse. The author is caught between supporting Mom and understanding Jeff's stance.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to tell Jeff he has an obligation. The author's reasoning was to help Mom, given that Jeff's refusal is hurting her. But Jeff feels justified in cutting ties due to the abuse. \n\nIn terms of ethics, family obligations can be complex. On one hand, the author might think it's important for the family to come together, especially for the mother's sake. On the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons not to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive to him. The author might not have considered that Jeff's trauma is real and that forcing participation could be retraumatizing. \n\nBut the author's intention was to support the mother, which is understandable. However, the author might not have fully considered Jeff's perspective before confronting him. Maybe a better approach would have been to let Jeff decide without pressure, or to mediate between Mom and Jeff instead of directly telling Jeff he has an obligation. \n\nThe key points here are the author's intent versus the outcome. The author acted out of a desire to help Mom, which is positive, but the method might have been flawed. It's possible that the author overstepped by implying Jeff had an obligation, not considering that Jeff might feel he has no responsibility to an abusive parent. \n\nSo, depending on cultural or familial expectations, the obligation might vary. If the family expects everyone to participate regardless of past issues, the author might not be wrong. But if Jeff has a legitimate right to opt out due to his experiences, the author might have pushed too hard. \n\nIn the end, the author's actions were well-meaning but perhaps not considering Jeff's trauma. Therefore, the answer might be that the author isn't entirely wrong, but there's a nuance. However, based on the question's options (A or B), the answer is B, because the author's intent was to help Mom and they might not be entirely wrong, even if the approach could be improved.\n"
