Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive when Jeff was younger but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been in contact since. Now that the dad is dead, the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him, but Jeff reacted angrily and refused to help.\n\nThe key points here are about obligation and empathy. The author believes Jeff should help for Mom's sake, but Jeff feels justified in not helping due to past abuse. The author's main argument is that Jeff has an obligation, but others might see it as respecting Jeff's choice not to participate in the funeral of someone who was abusive to him.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no legal obligation to help with a funeral unless specified by law or prearranged. However, family dynamics and personal ethics play a role. The author might think they're helping their mom, but pushing Jeff could disregard his trauma and boundaries. \n\nThe author's approach might be seen as imposing their own feelings onto Jeff. They might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is a valid emotional response to past abuse. The question is whether the author overstepped by telling Jeff he has an obligation, which could be seen as invalidating Jeff's experience.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable. However, the way they approached it might not have been the best method. They should have considered Jeff's perspective and possibly found a middle ground, like letting Jeff decide how he wants to honor their dad without direct involvement in the funeral if that's his choice.\n\nSo, the author might not be entirely wrong, but their approach could have been more empathetic. However, the question is whether they were in the wrong. The answer likely hinges on whether the obligation was imposed without considering Jeff's feelings. Since Jeff had valid reasons to not participate, the author's insistence might be seen as wrong.\n"
