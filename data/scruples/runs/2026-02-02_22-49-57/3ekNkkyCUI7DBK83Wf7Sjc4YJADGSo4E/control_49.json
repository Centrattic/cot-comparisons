Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive, especially to Jeff, and even after getting sober, there were issues. The author tried to convince Jeff to help their mom with the funeral, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad was abusive when Jeff was younger, and Jeff moved out early to escape that. The author wasn't around during the worst of it, so they might not fully grasp Jeff's trauma. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping, and the author tried to mediate. But Jeff's refusal is rooted in past abuse, which is valid. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they were trying to help their mom, which is understandable. But they might not have considered Jeff's feelings and trauma. Obligating someone to participate in a funeral for someone who abused them could be seen as insensitive. However, the author's intention was to support their mom. The question is whether the author overstepped by telling Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" implying he must help despite his past. \n\nOn one hand, the author is advocating for their mom's emotional well-being. On the other, they might have forced Jeff into a situation he's not ready for. The answer depends on balancing these factors. The author's approach might have been too direct without acknowledging Jeff's perspective. But their intent was good. The key is whether the author is wrong in expecting Jeff to help despite his trauma. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author was trying to help, but there's nuance. However, the community might see it as AITA if they forced an obligation without understanding Jeff's stance. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that they were trying to support their mom and had good intentions, even if the approach was flawed, maybe they're not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
