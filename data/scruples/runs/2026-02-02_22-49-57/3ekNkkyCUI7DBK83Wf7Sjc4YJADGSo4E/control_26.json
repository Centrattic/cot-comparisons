Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their older brother he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral, especially since their dad was abusive towards the brother.\n\nFirst, the brother, Jeff, was abused by their dad. The author wasn't around as much when the abuse occurred but knows about it through stories from Jeff and their mom. Now that their dad is dead, the author and mom are handling the funeral, but Jeff refuses to help. The author tried to convince Jeff, but he got angry and refused, saying he won't help because of the abuse.\n\nThe key points here are the obligation to help with a funeral despite past abuse. The author's stance is that Jeff should help for their mom's sake. But Jeff has valid reasons to be upset given his history with their dad. The question is whether the author is wrong for pushing Jeff to help when he had a traumatic experience with their father.\n\nIn terms of ethics, family obligations can be complex. It's common for people to have different levels of involvement based on their past experiences. The author's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable, but they might not have considered Jeff's emotional state and justified anger towards their dad.\n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they're trying to support their mom, but they might not have fully considered Jeff's perspective. However, the answer depends on whether it's fair to demand help when past abuse is involved. Since Jeff has a legitimate reason to cut ties, the author might be overstepping by insisting he help. Therefore, the answer could be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect Jeff's justified feelings.\n"
