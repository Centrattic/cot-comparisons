Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves their brother Jeff not helping with their father's funeral.\n\nFirst, the father was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, especially when he was drinking. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been back. The author thinks their dad mellowed out after they were born, maybe because he got sober. The mother is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place and tried to convince him to help for their mom's sake. Jeff had a strong negative reaction, calling the author an idiot and refusing to help.\n\nSo the question is whether the author was wrong to tell Jeff he should help. Let's break it down. The author's intention was to help their mom by getting Jeff involved. Jeff had valid reasons for not wanting to participate because of the abuse. However, the author might have felt that the mom is suffering and Jeff should do it for her. \n\nOn one hand, the author might be right to try to reconcile the family, especially if the father's behavior has changed. On the other hand, Jeff's trauma is significant, and pushing him could be insensitive. The author might not fully understand Jeff's perspective, especially since he wasn't subjected to the abuse. \n\nBut the author's action was to mediate between their mom and Jeff. If they approached it with empathy, maybe they could have found a middle ground. However, they did confront Jeff directly, which might have been the wrong approach. The author's message might have come off as judgmental, making Jeff defensive. \n\nConsidering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom. However, they might not have considered Jeff's feelings enough. The answer could be B (Not in the wrong) but with a note about approach. Alternatively, maybe A if the author overstepped. But given that Jeff's refusal is justified, the author isn't necessarily at fault for trying to mediate. So the answer is B.\n"
