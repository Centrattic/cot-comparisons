Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their brother to help with the funeral of their abusive dad. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The older brother, Jeff, had a really bad experience with their dad\u2014abuse, yelling, drunk. The author, the younger sibling, didn't experience that much because the dad mellowed out after they were born. The dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to talk to Jeff, urging him to help for Mom's sake. Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the author is asking if they're at fault for pressuring Jeff. Let's consider the angles. On one hand, the mom is grieving and wants closure, maybe. The author might feel that the family should come together for her. On the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate\u2014his traumatic experiences with the dad. The author acknowledges that Jeff's reasons are understandable but still thinks he should help Mom. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the author's intention was to support Mom, which is understandable. But did they respect Jeff's autonomy? Maybe not. Jeff has the right to decide his own involvement, especially given the abuse. The author might have assumed Jeff's obligation without considering his trauma. However, the author's actions came from a place of trying to help Mom, which can be seen as compassionate, but maybe they didn't approach it the right way.\n\nAlso, Jeff's reaction was defensive and angry, which shows the depth of his feelings about the dad. The author might not fully grasp the emotional impact on Jeff. But the author isn't the one who caused the abuse; they were younger and perhaps didn't experience it. \n\nIn terms of ethics, whether someone is obligated to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive is debatable. Some might argue that the family should support each other in death, even after a difficult life. Others might say that there's no obligation to honor someone who was harmful. \n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped. They went to Jeff's house to convince him, which could be seen as pressuring him. The author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is valid and his right. However, the author's motivation was to ease Mom's pain, which is a valid concern. But maybe they should have respected Jeff's choice instead of trying to force him to participate.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom. But they might have failed to recognize Jeff's valid reasons for not wanting to participate. It's a bit of a grey area. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer is more on the side of not being in the wrong (B), but with a note that they could have handled it differently. But according to the options, B is \"No\" (not in the wrong), so the answer would be B.\n"
