Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. The situation involves abuse from their dad towards Jeff, who has since moved out and not looked back. The author went to Jeff to convince him to help the mom with the funeral, but Jeff was upset and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The dad was abusive when Jeff was younger, especially when drinking. The author isn't as affected because they were younger when the dad mellowed out. Mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to mediate but Jeff reacted negatively.\n\nThe key points here are about obligation and empathy. The author thinks Jeff should help for Mom's sake, but Jeff feels justified in not participating because of past abuse. The author's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable. However, does that give them the right to pressure Jeff?\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to help their mother, which is a valid concern. On the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate. The author might be overstepping by implying an obligation when the brother has a history of trauma.\n\nI should consider if the author had the right to confront Jeff. The author went on their own initiative, maybe without considering Jeff's perspective. The author's message might have been condescending, calling Jeff a \"dick,\" which could have escalated the situation. Jeff's anger is a reaction to being forced to reconcile with someone who harmed him.\n\nThe author's position is in the middle, trying to balance both sides. But in terms of fault, the author isn't wrong for caring about their mom, but they might have mishandled the approach. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since Jeff's refusal is based on his experience, the author's insistence might not be justified. Therefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong), but there's nuance here. The author's action is understandable, but the approach could have been better. However, the core issue is whether the author was wrong, which they aren't.\n"
