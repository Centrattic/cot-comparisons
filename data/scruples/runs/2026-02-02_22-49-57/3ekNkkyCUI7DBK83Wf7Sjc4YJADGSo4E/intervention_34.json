Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother to help with their dad's funeral. The situation is that their dad was abusive towards their brother, Jeff, but not the author. Jeff doesn't want to help with the funeral, and the author tried to convince him, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive, especially to Jeff, so Jeff's refusal might be justified from his perspective. The mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping, and the author is caught in the middle. The author went to Jeff's house to ask him to help for the mother's sake. Jeff responded angrily, and the author hasn't told the mother yet.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't. Let me break down the points. The author tried to mediate between their mom and brother, possibly out of concern for their mom's feelings. But Jeff has a valid reason not to participate due to past abuse. The author might have overstepped by telling Jeff he has an obligation, which Jeff might not feel he has, especially given the history.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to help their mom, so their motive is good. But Jeff's refusal is based on legitimate trauma. The author might not have considered that Jeff might not want to be involved regardless of the mother's feelings. The key here is whether the author should have respected Jeff's wishes without trying to push him. \n\nIn some cultures or families, there's an expectation that all family members participate in a funeral, but others might see it differently, especially after abuse. The author's approach might have been well-meaning but perhaps not thoughtful of Jeff's trauma. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries. Alternatively, if the author's role was to support the mother, maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author should have acknowledged Jeff's feelings instead of pushing him. The author's statement about obligation might have been the trigger. Jeff's response shows he's unwilling, so the author's insistence might have been wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong). But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The author tried to mediate, but maybe they should have focused on helping the mother without pressuring Jeff. So yes, the author might be in the wrong for not considering Jeff's perspective enough.\n"
