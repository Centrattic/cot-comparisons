Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The situation involves an abusive father, so there's a lot of emotional context.\n\nFirst, the brother, Jeff, had a really bad experience with their dad. He was abused when their dad drank, which he did a lot. The author wasn't around during that time as much because their dad sobered up after the author was born. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been part of the family since. Now, with their dad's death, the mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral.\n\nThe author went to Jeff to convince him, arguing that he should help for Mom's sake. Jeff reacted angrily, saying the author doesn't understand and refuses to participate. The author is caught between wanting to support Mom and understanding Jeff's trauma.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, they were trying to mediate a family conflict. The author's intention was to help Mom by getting Jeff involved. However, Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate due to past abuse. The author might not have considered Jeff's emotional state and the possibility that forcing him could cause more harm. But at the same time, the author's effort to reconcile might be seen as reasonable because they wanted to ease their mom's distress.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation unless there's a legal duty, which there isn't. So the author might be assuming a moral obligation on Jeff's part. But given Jeff's history, it's a sensitive issue. The author's approach could be seen as imposing their own perspective without fully understanding Jeff's trauma. However, the author's intent was good. It's a tough spot because they're trying to balance two family members' needs.\n\nIn the end, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to help Mom. They might not have considered Jeff's feelings enough, but the act of mediating isn't inherently wrong. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's room for nuance. However, according to the typical \"Am I the Asshole?\" framework, the author's actions are seen as trying to help, even if the outcome was negative. So the answer is B.\n"
