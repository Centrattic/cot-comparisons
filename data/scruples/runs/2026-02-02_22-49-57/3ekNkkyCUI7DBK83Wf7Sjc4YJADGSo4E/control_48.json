Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive towards the brother, but mellowed out after the author was born.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The brother, Jeff, was abused by their dad when he was younger. He moved out at 18 and hasn't looked back. Now that their dad died, the mom and the author want Jeff to help with the funeral, but he refuses. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author's intention was to help their mom by getting Jeff involved. But Jeff has a history of abuse from their dad. The author might not fully understand Jeff's trauma. However, the author is also trying to support their mom's emotional needs. \n\nOn one hand, the author might be right to consider their mom's feelings. On the other hand, they might not have considered Jeff's valid reasons for not wanting to participate. The author approached Jeff directly, which could have been sensitive. Maybe they should have respected Jeff's boundaries given the abuse. But maybe the author's intention was good, even if the approach was flawed.\n\nKey points: The dad was abusive, Jeff was a victim, mom is upset. The author tried to mediate. The question is whether the author was wrong to push Jeff to help despite his past.\n\nPossible angles: The author might not realize the trauma from abuse, leading them to overlook Jeff's right to disengage. Alternatively, the mother's needs are valid, but the author's approach might have been too confrontational. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author overstepped by imposing an obligation on Jeff, who has legitimate reasons to avoid the funeral. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to help their mom, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. However, given the situation, the author's position could be seen as not in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom, even if the approach wasn't perfect. The abuse history is significant, so Jeff's refusal is understandable. The author might have been in a tough spot between two family members.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They tried to mediate between their mom and brother, even though the outcome was tense. Their intention was to support their mom, which is valid, even if Jeff's refusal is understandable.\n"
