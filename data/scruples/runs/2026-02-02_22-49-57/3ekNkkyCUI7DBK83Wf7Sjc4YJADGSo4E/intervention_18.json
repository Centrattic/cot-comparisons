Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The brother, Jeff, had a really bad experience with their dad, who was abusive when Jeff was younger. The author thinks their dad mellowed out when they were born, maybe because he got sober. Now their mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral.\n\nThe author went to Jeff's place to convince him, and Jeff got angry, called them an idiot, and refused to help. The author hasn't told their mom yet and is feeling torn between her and Jeff.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider the factors. The author's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable. But Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate due to past abuse. The author might not have considered that Jeff might need to be on his own terms, or that forcing him to help could make things worse. However, the author's approach might have been a bit direct. Maybe they should have approached Jeff more gently, given his history. But is that being in the wrong? Or is it just a miscalculation in approach?\n\nAlso, the author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping, so the author's effort was to mediate. But Jeff's refusal is his right, especially given the abuse. The author might not have the authority to impose obligations on their brother. However, the author's actions were well-meaning, trying to help their mom, which is a good intent. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a tricky situation. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were trying to support their mother, but they might not have considered Jeff's perspective enough. However, the key point is that Jeff's refusal isn't invalid. The author's approach might have been too confrontational. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for asserting that Jeff has an obligation. \n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation that family members, especially siblings, would help with funeral arrangements. But if Jeff has a history of abuse, that might override that obligation. The author might not have realized the depth of Jeff's trauma. So, while the author's intention was good, they might not have respected Jeff's boundaries. However, the act of trying to mediate isn't wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author wasn't in the wrong, but their approach could have been better. However, the question is about right or wrong, not the approach. Since the author acted out of concern for their mom, which is a valid reason, and the obligation might be seen as a family matter, but Jeff's refusal is also valid. So the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe could have handled it differently.\n"
