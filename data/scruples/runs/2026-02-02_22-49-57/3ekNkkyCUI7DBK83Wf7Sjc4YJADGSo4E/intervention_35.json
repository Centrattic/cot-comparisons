Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he must help with their dad's funeral. The situation involves an abusive father who was particularly harsh to the older brother, Jeff. The author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with funeral plans.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, but mellowed out when the author was born. Jeff left home at 18, so he's been away from the family for a while. Now that the dad is dead, the author thinks Jeff should help with the funeral for Mom's sake. The author confronted Jeff, who got angry and refused to help. The author is now wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: 1) Should Jeff be obligated to help with the funeral despite past trauma? 2) Was the author right to impose this obligation?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people can have different views. Some might argue that family obligations are important, especially for a funeral. Others might say that if Jeff was abused, it's understandable he doesn't want to participate. The author's intention was to help Mom, which is commendable, but forcing Jeff to engage with someone who caused him pain might be insensitive.\n\nThe author's approach was to tell Jeff he has an obligation. But obligations can be subjective. Jeff's refusal is based on his own experiences, which are valid. The author might not fully grasp the depth of Jeff's trauma. However, the author's actions were motivated by concern for their mother's feelings, which is a valid perspective too.\n\nIt's a tough spot because the author is caught between two family members. The question is about whether the author overstepped. Since Jeff was abusive towards the author's brother, the author might not realize the trauma involved. But the author's intention was to help their mother, which isn't inherently wrong. However, suggesting an obligation without considering Jeff's feelings could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had good intentions, they might not have considered Jeff's right to disengage from the funeral due to his past. So, the author could be seen as not entirely in the wrong, but perhaps could have approached it differently. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would likely be B (No), as they were trying to mediate for their mother's sake, even if the approach was flawed.\n"
