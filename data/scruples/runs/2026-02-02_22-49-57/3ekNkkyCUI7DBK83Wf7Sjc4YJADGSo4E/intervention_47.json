Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about their dad's funeral and whether their older brother, Jeff, should help. The author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't contributing. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him to help, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, which the author knows about. Jeff moved out early and hasn't been in touch. The author's dad later mellowed out, especially after the author was born. The author is trying to mediate between Jeff and their mom. The author told Jeff he has an obligation to help with the funeral for Mom's sake. Jeff reacted badly, calling the author names and refusing to help.\n\nNow, the key points: Is the author wrong for asking Jeff to help? Well, the author's intention was to help Mom, which is understandable. But Jeff has a history of abuse. The author might not fully grasp the trauma Jeff went through. However, the author isn't forcing Jeff to participate beyond what he's comfortable with, just asking for some help. But Jeff's refusal is valid given his past. The author's approach might have been a bit pushy, especially with the word \"obligation,\" which could imply that Jeff has a duty regardless of his feelings. Maybe the author should have approached it more sensitively, focusing on Mom's need for closure without making Jeff feel obligated. However, given the emotional situation, maybe the author's actions are justifiable to support the mother. \n\nOn the other hand, Jeff has every right to not want to participate, given the abuse. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to mediate, but the way they approached Jeff could be part of the problem. The author's statement about \"obligation\" might not consider Jeff's emotional state. But since the author's mom is affected, there's a balance here. It's a tricky situation. The author is trying to do the right thing but might not have considered the emotional impact on Jeff. \n\nIn the end, the author's intention was to help their mom, which is good, but they might not have fully considered Jeff's perspective. However, given that Jeff was abusive, the author isn't wrong for trying to bridge the gap. It's a complex family situation where no one is entirely right or wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they acted with good intentions and didn't force Jeff, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure. The author's approach could be improved, but the action itself isn't morally wrong.\n"
