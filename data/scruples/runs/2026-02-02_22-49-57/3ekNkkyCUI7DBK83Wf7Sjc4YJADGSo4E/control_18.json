Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive to the brother, especially when he was younger. The author, who had a better relationship with the dad, wants the brother to help out for their mom's sake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The brother has legitimate reasons to be upset. Abuse is a serious issue, and someone who was a victim might not want to take part in honoring the person who harmed them. The author is trying to mediate between their mom's needs and their brother's trauma. \n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, they approached Jeff to help, which is understandable. However, they might not have considered Jeff's feelings deeply enough. The author might be imposing their own views of reconciliation without realizing that Jeff's refusal is a valid emotional response. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is distressed because Jeff isn't helping. The author is trying to support their mom, which is also a valid concern. The key here is whether the author respected Jeff's autonomy and his reasons. The author told Jeff he has an obligation, which might not be fair, given the context of abuse. \n\nIn the end, the author's intention was good, but they might not have acknowledged the deeper trauma and Jeff's right to set boundaries. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for pressuring Jeff without fully understanding his perspective.\n"
