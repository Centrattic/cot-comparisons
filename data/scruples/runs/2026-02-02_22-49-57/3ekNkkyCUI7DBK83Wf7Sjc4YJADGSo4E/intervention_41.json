Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff to help with their dad's funeral. The situation involves an abusive father who was particularly harsh to Jeff but mellowed out with the narrator. Jeff moved out early, didn't reconnect, and now refuses to help with the funeral. The author tried to convince Jeff, but Jeff was hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive, especially to Jeff. The author is trying to mediate between Jeff and their mom, who's upset. The author's intention was to help Mom by getting Jeff involved. Jeff's reaction is understandable given his past trauma. But does that mean the author is in the wrong for pushing Jeff to help?\n\nThe key points: The author believed Jeff had an obligation to help Mom. Jeff doesn't want to participate because of the abuse. The author's approach might have been well-meaning but could be seen as pressuring Jeff, who has valid reasons to not engage with their dad's funeral. \n\nHowever, the author isn't forcing Jeff; they're trying to persuade him for Mom's sake. It's about balancing respect for Jeff's trauma with the need to support their mom. The author might not be in the wrong because they're acting out of concern for their mother and trying to facilitate family unity. But maybe they should have considered Jeff's feelings more carefully. \n\nOn the other hand, Jeff's refusal isn't unreasonable. The author might have overstepped by framing it as an obligation, but their intention was good. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author was trying to help their mom, even if the method could be improved. But there's nuance here\u2014maybe the author should have acknowledged Jeff's trauma more before expecting participation. Still, the core issue is about whether the author's actions were wrong. Considering all, the answer is B.\n"
