Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The situation is that their father was abusive towards Jeff, the older brother, but became less so after the author was born. Jeff left home when he was 18, and now after the dad's death, Jeff refuses to help with the funeral. The author tried to convince Jeff, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad was abusive, especially to Jeff. The author wasn't subjected to the same treatment. The mother wants both sons to help, but Jeff is resisting due to past trauma. The author's intention was to help the mom, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's feelings enough.\n\nThe question is about obligation. The author argued that Jeff has an obligation. But in cases of abuse, people often cut ties. The author might not realize how deep Jeff's resentment is. The author's approach could have been more empathetic. Maybe they should have discussed Jeff's feelings rather than focusing on obligation. However, the author's motivation was to support their mom, which is understandable. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they tried to mediate, but maybe they overstepped by framing it as an obligation without understanding Jeff's perspective. But Jeff's behavior was confrontational. The author might have a point in wanting to support their mom, but perhaps their approach wasn't the best. However, the core issue is whether the author is wrong for expecting Jeff to help. Since Jeff has a valid reason to not participate, the author's insistence might not consider his trauma. So, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement. \n\nAnswer B (No) because the author's intention was to support their mom, but maybe the approach could have been better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since Jeff's refusal is due to valid reasons, the author isn't necessarily wrong to ask, but maybe the way they did it. However, the main issue is the obligation. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to mediate. So B.\n"
