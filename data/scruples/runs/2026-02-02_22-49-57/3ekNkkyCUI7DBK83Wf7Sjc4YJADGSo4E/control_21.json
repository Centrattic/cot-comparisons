Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral, given the dad was abusive.\n\nFirst, the context: The dad was abusive when their brother Jeff was younger, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18, the dad became sober, and now he's died. The author and their mom want Jeff to help with the funeral, but Jeff refuses, saying he won't help because of the past. The author confronted Jeff, leading to an argument.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to push Jeff. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to help their mom by getting Jeff involved, which is understandable. The mom is upset, and the author might feel responsible for her emotional state. Also, the dad did mellow out later, so maybe the author thinks Jeff should honor him despite the past.\n\nOn the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate. The dad was abusive, and Jeff has a right to his feelings. The author might not fully grasp the trauma Jeff went through, especially since Jeff left home early. The author's approach could have been more empathetic. Telling Jeff he \"needs\" to help might come off as dismissive of his past trauma. \n\nFamily obligations can be complex. While there might be a cultural or familial expectation for siblings to help with funerals, it's also important to respect someone's boundaries, especially after trauma. The author's approach was confrontational, which might have made Jeff more defensive. Maybe a different approach, like expressing the mom's feelings without demanding, could have been better. \n\nAlso, the author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is about his own healing and not just being a \" dick\" as the author put it. The author's message that Jeff has an obligation could be seen as pressuring him to reconcile with a past he's not ready for. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a simple yes or no. However, the key here is whether the author's actions were inconsiderate. By not fully understanding Jeff's perspective and approaching it as an obligation, the author might have overstepped. The author's intention was to help mom, but the method could have been more respectful of Jeff's feelings. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider Jeff's trauma and approached it in a way that might have been dismissive of his valid feelings.\n"
