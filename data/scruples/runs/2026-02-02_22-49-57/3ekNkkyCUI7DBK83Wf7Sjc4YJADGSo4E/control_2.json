Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for telling their older brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The brother, Jeff, had a very abusive relationship with their dad. The author mentions that Jeff was physically and verbally abused, and that their mom stayed in the abusive situation. The dad's behavior mellowed out when the author was born, maybe due to sobriety. Now that the dad has died, the author and their mom are trying to plan the funeral, but Jeff is refusing to help. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him, leading to an argument where Jeff lashed out. The author is now caught between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's feelings.\n\nSo, the key points here are the abuse Jeff endured, the author's attempt to mediate, and the conflict that arose. The question is whether the author was wrong in insisting that Jeff help with the funeral. \n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to support their mom, who's upset. The author might feel that the family should come together, even for a funeral. But on the other hand, Jeff's refusal is rooted in trauma from the abuse. The author might not fully understand the depth of Jeff's feelings, given that he wasn't subjected to the same abuse as Jeff. \n\nFamily obligations can be complex, especially after abuse. The author's approach might have come across as dismissive of Jeff's trauma, making Jeff feel pressured to participate in something that triggers bad memories. The author's statement about Jeff having an \"obligation\" could be seen as invalidating Jeff's experiences. \n\nHowever, the author's motivation was to help their mom, which is understandable. But the way they approached it, possibly without considering Jeff's emotional state, might have been the issue. The argument escalated because Jeff felt attacked or forced into something he wasn't ready to do. \n\nIn AITA situations, intent vs. impact is a common theme. The author's intent was to help, but the impact might have been harmful. Whether that makes them the asshole depends on whether they had the right to pressure Jeff, given the history. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom, but they might not have considered Jeff's trauma enough. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the author did approach Jeff, leading to conflict, and didn't fully acknowledge Jeff's valid reasons, there's a case for AITA. But maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, because they were trying to mediate. Wait, but pushing someone who has trauma to participate in a family event could be seen as wrong. The author might not have the right to enforce an obligation here. So perhaps A is the answer, but I'm a bit conflicted. \n\nLooking at the options: A is yes (author is wrong), B is no. Considering that Jeff has a valid reason to not want to participate, and the author's insistence might have been unkind, even if well-intentioned, the answer could be A. Alternatively, the author's effort to mediate is good, but the method was poor. But AITA often considers intent, so maybe B. Hmm. I need to decide based on the scenario. The author's statement about obligation might be the key point. Obligation in a family where abuse occurred isn't straightforward. Jeff has the right to decline, so the author was wrong to pressure him. Therefore, the answer is A."
