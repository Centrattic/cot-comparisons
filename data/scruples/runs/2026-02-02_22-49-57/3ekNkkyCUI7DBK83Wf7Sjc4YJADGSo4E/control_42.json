Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't had contact since. Now that the dad is dead, the author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to convince Jeff, but Jeff refused, calling him names and saying he won't help because of the abuse he suffered.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The dad was abusive to Jeff. 2) Jeff left home and cut ties. 3) The author is trying to get Jeff to help with the funeral for their mom's sake. 4) Jeff is upset and refuses.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's intention was to help their mom by getting Jeff involved. But Jeff has a history of trauma from the dad. Is it right to expect Jeff to help with the funeral of someone who abused him? \n\nOn one hand, family obligations might be considered, especially for the mother's emotional well-being. On the other hand, Jeff's mental health and past trauma are valid. The author might have assumed Jeff would have a responsibility, but Jeff has legitimate reasons not to participate. \n\nThe author's approach was to tell Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" which Jeff took as a demand. Jeff's reaction was defensive and angry, which makes sense given his history. The author might not have considered that Jeff could have unresolved trauma and might not want any part of the funeral. \n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not understanding Jeff's perspective and pushing for something that's emotionally difficult for him. The author's intention was good (helping mom), but the method might have been wrong. \n\nHowever, the author's mom is upset, and the author is trying to mediate. But in doing so, they might have imposed their own expectations on Jeff without considering his trauma. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. But the author did approach Jeff with the idea that he \"needs to contribute,\" which could be seen as pressuring him to do something that's not in his capacity. Therefore, the author might be partly in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries and past experiences. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they might have forced Jeff into a situation he's not comfortable with, not considering his trauma. Alternatively, B (No) if they were just trying to help their mom. But given the context, the pressure on Jeff might be unwarranted. Hmm.\n"
