Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive when Jeff was younger but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been in contact. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff reacted angrily, saying he won't help. The author hasn't told mom yet and is conflicted.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abuse, the change in dad's behavior, and the author's attempt to mediate. The author's intention was to help mom, but Jeff's refusal is understandable given his past. The question is whether the author had the right to pressure Jeff.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They were trying to support their mom during a hard time, which is a valid concern. The term \"obligation\" might be the point of contention. Even though Jeff might have a right to refuse, the author's approach was to appeal to family duty for mom's sake. However, the author didn't force Jeff; they just expressed the situation. Jeff's reaction was expected given his trauma. So, the author's actions were well-meaning, even if Jeff didn't comply. No one is in the wrong here, but especially the author.\n"
