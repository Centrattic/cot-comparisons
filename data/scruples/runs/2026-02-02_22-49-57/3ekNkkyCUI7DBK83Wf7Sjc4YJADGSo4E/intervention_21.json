Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for telling their older brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The father was abusive to the older brother, Jeff, when he was younger. The writer, who is younger, didn't experience the same level of abuse and their dad became mellow after they were born. Now the dad has died, and the writer's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The writer went to Jeff's place to convince him to help, and Jeff reacted angrily, blaming the writer for not understanding and refusing to participate. The writer hasn't told their mom yet and is conflicted between supporting her and understanding Jeff's position.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author at fault for telling Jeff he should help with the funeral? The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nI should consider the ethics here. The writer was trying to help their mom, who has been a victim of the father's abuse and is now grieving. The writer's intent was to mediate the situation, even though they know Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate. \n\nBut does the writer have the right to pressure Jeff? Since Jeff was the one who suffered the abuse and stopped contact with the dad, his refusal could be a personal choice based on trauma. However, the mom is hurt and maybe the writer is trying to reconcile the family during a difficult time. \n\nThe key points are the writer's motivation (helping mom) versus Jeff's right to make his own decision about participating in the funeral. The writer might not be in the wrong if they acted out of concern for their mom, especially if the mom is also a victim of the abuse and deserving of support. But they could also be seen as overstepping by implying Jeff has an obligation, considering his past experiences.\n\nIn the AITA context, people often weigh intentions and consequences. The writer's intention was good, but Jeff's reaction shows that the approach might have been confrontational. Maybe the writer could have been more empathetic, acknowledging Jeff's feelings before appealing to his sense of duty. \n\nHowever, the writer didn't physically force Jeff or use harsh language beyond telling him he's being a dick. It was a direct but perhaps not the most tactful approach. The question is whether the writer's action was wrong. Since Jeff is an adult and can make his own decisions, the writer might not be in the wrong for trying to get him to help, even if Jeff is resistant. The obligation isn't legally binding but more emotional. If the mom is in pain, the writer is trying to address that. \n\nBut some might argue that the writer should have respected Jeff's choice, especially given his history. The answer might depend on cultural expectations and family dynamics. In some cultures, family obligations are more enforced, while in others, personal choice is prioritized. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They were trying to support their mom during a hard time. However, the approach could have been better handled with more empathy. The wrongness here isn't about the intent but the imposition of obligation despite Jeff's trauma. But since the author's action was well-meaning, even if the method was harsh, they might be justified. Family dynamics are complex, and the author is caught in the middle. Jeff's refusal is his right, but the author's concern for the mom is valid. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
