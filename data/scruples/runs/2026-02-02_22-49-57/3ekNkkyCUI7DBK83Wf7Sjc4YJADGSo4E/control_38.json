Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong (AITA) for telling their older brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with their abusive father's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points from the story. The father was abusive to Jeff when he was younger. He drank a lot and was physically abusive. The author, who is younger, didn't experience the same abuse because the father mellowed after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been in touch. The father had a stroke and died, and the mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to convince Jeff, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was wrong to tell Jeff he has an obligation to help. Let's consider the ethical angles here. On one hand, the mother is grieving and wants family support. The author is trying to help her by involving Jeff. On the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate due to the abuse he suffered. The author might think Jeff has a moral obligation to attend, but Jeff's trauma could make that difficult or even harmful.\n\nThe author's approach might be seen as insensitive. They didn't consider Jeff's feelings but instead framed the request as an obligation, which could sound like they're dismissing Jeff's pain. However, the author's intention was to support the mother. It's a delicate balance between respecting family dynamics and individual trauma.\n\nIn similar situations, people often debate the balance between family obligations and personal trauma. Some might argue that the author overstepped by not considering Jeff's perspective, while others might say the author was trying to do the right thing by promoting family unity during a grieving process. The key here is whether the author's actions respected Jeff's autonomy and history.\n\nJeff's refusal is understandable given his past. The author's approach might have been too confrontational, not giving Jeff the space to express his feelings. Instead of framing it as an obligation, perhaps a more empathetic approach would have been better. However, the author's actions were driven by concern for the mother, which is a valid consideration.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but their approach could have been more sensitive. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong, not whether their approach was optimal. Since they tried to mediate between their mother's needs and Jeff's feelings, maybe they're not in the wrong. But given that they told Jeff he had an obligation, which might not consider his past, it's a close call. The answer might lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because they were trying to help the mother, but it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points.\n"
