Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The dad was abusive when Jeff was younger but mellowed out after the narrator was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back. The dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The narrator went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff was angry and refused to help, calling the narrator an idiot. The narrator is torn between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's feelings.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about obligation and emotional impact. The author tried to mediate between Jeff and their mom, arguing that Jeff should help for Mom's sake. Jeff, however, has a valid reason not to want to participate due to past abuse. The author might not realize that forcing someone to participate in a funeral against their will can be traumatic, especially after abuse.\n\nBut the author's intention was to help their mom. They might not have considered Jeff's trauma. However, the author is in the middle, trying to support both sides. The question is whether it's wrong to push Jeff to participate. Since Jeff has every right to not want to be involved, the author's approach might be seen as disregarding Jeff's feelings. But the author isn't the one causing the problem; the dad was the abuser. The author is trying to help the mom, which is compassionate. However, maybe the author should have approached the situation differently, respecting Jeff's wishes more.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the judgment often hinges on the balance of rights and responsibilities. The author's action was to ask Jeff to help, which could be seen as reasonable from the mom's perspective. However, Jeff's right to not participate due to trauma is also valid. The author's mistake might be not acknowledging that Jeff's refusal is valid. But the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom, and Jeff's actions were more extreme (calling them an idiot, refusing to help). The author is caught in the middle, and the wrong here might not be on their side. So the answer is B (No).\n"
