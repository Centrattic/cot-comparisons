Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling their older brother he has to help with their abusive dad's funeral. The situation is that their dad was abusive to the brother, Jeff, but then mellowed out when the author was born. Now the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral, and the author went to talk to Jeff, who got angry and refused to help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, which is a serious issue. Abuse can have long-lasting effects, and it's possible that Jeff has a lot of unresolved trauma. The author, on the other hand, didn't experience the same level of abuse and is maybe seeing the situation from a different perspective, especially since the dad mellowed out later.\n\nThe mom is caught in the middle, feeling upset because Jeff isn't helping. The author tried to mediate, but that led to a conflict. The key question is whether the author was wrong to pressure Jeff into helping with the funeral. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people have the right to decide how they want to handle their relationships with abusive parents. Forcing someone to participate in a funeral for someone who abused them could be traumatic. The author might not realize that Jeff's refusal is a valid response to his past. On the other hand, the author is trying to help their mom, which is understandable. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the author acted out of concern for their mom, but maybe didn't fully consider Jeff's feelings. However, the author didn't force Jeff to do anything; they just asked him to contribute for the mom's sake. Jeff's reaction was extreme, but maybe the author's intentions were good. However, the author might not have the right to tell Jeff what he owes the family, especially given the history of abuse. \n\nIn some cases, family obligations are expected, but when there's abuse involved, those obligations might not be as straightforward. The author's approach could be seen as dismissive of Jeff's trauma. However, the author is not the one causing the problem; the issue is Jeff's refusal. The author tried to bridge the gap but was met with hostility. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author overstepped. If the author was trying to help their mom and didn't realize the depth of Jeff's trauma, they might not be in the wrong. But if they were imposing their will on Jeff without considering his perspective, maybe they are. However, the author's actions were to mediate, not to force. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They were trying to support their mom's emotional needs, even if they didn't fully grasp Jeff's situation. Jeff's refusal is his choice, and the author's intention was to help, not to be cruel. However, this is a bit of a gray area. But given the options, B seems right."
