Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The situation is that their dad was abusive towards Jeff, but not so much towards the author. Now that the dad is dead, Jeff refuses to help with the funeral, causing mom distress. The author tried to convince Jeff, but he blew up and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive, especially to Jeff. The author wasn't around much during that time, so they might not fully grasp the trauma. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping, and the author is caught in the middle. \n\nThe author's intention was to support mom by getting Jeff to help. But Jeff's refusal is understandable given his past. The question is whether the author was wrong to push Jeff. \n\nFrom one angle, the author is trying to help their mom, which is a good motive. But they might not realize how deep Jeff's resentment goes. On the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons to not want to participate. The author might not be in the wrong because they're acting in good faith, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's approach was respectful. They went to Jeff to convince him, which is reasonable. However, telling someone they have an \"obligation\" might come across as dismissive of Jeff's feelings. Maybe the author should have been more empathetic. But overall, the author's actions were well-meaning, so they're probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
