Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff he should help with their dad's funeral. The situation involves an abusive father who was particularly harsh to Jeff but mellowed out for the author. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been in contact since. The dad died, and the mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping. The author went to Jeff to convince him, leading to an argument where Jeff refused.\n\nFirst, consider the dynamics. Jeff had a terrible relationship with their dad, which is valid. The author is caught between supporting their mom's emotional needs and respecting Jeff's right to distance himself from someone who was abusive. The author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. But Jeff's refusal is grounded in his traumatic experiences. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author tried to mediate by talking to Jeff, which is a reasonable approach. They didn't force Jeff or make threats. However, the author might not have fully considered Jeff's perspective. By saying Jeff has an \"obligation,\" the author could be invalidating Jeff's feelings. But the author's action was well-meaning. \n\nOn the other hand, Jeff's response was hostile, but that's his reaction to the situation. The author's approach wasn't malicious. They tried to reason and left when things escalated. The key point is whether pushing Jeff to participate in the funeral, despite his clear trauma, is fair. The author might have a point in wanting to support their mom, but the expectation of obligation could be misplaced. However, given the context, the author isn't in the wrong because their intentions were good and they acted out of concern for their mom's emotional well-being. The answer is B.\n"
