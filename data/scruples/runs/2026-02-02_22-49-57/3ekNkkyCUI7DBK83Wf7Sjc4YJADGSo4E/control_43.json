Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their dad's funeral and whether the older brother, Jeff, should help. The author's dad was abusive when Jeff was younger but mellowed out when the author was born. Now that the dad has died, the author and their mom want Jeff to help with the funeral, but he's refusing. The author went to talk to Jeff and told him he has an obligation to help for Mom's sake. Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Jeff had a bad experience with their dad, including physical abuse when he drank. The dad did get sober after the author's birth, so maybe things improved later. The author wasn't there for the worst of the abuse, so they might not fully understand Jeff's trauma. \n\nThe author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping. The author tried to mediate, but Jeff is holding a grudge. The question is whether the author was wrong to pressure Jeff into helping. \n\nObligation is subjective. Should family members help with funerals regardless of past issues? Or is it okay for Jeff to refuse given his history? The author might not realize how deep Jeff's resentment is. But they might also be trying to protect their mom's feelings. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were trying to support their mom and the family. But maybe they didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. They said Jeff has an obligation, which Jeff disagrees with. However, the author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They're caught between their mom and brother, and trying to do the right thing. Even though Jeff has valid reasons to be angry, the author's effort to reconcile and help the mom isn't wrong. The fault isn't entirely on the author for wanting the family to come together.\n"
