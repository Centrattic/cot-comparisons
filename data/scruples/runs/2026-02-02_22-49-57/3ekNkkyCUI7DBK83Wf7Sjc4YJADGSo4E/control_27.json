Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff to help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive towards Jeff, especially when he was younger. The author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping, and the author tried to convince Jeff, which led to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the abuse. Jeff had a really bad experience with their dad, which is valid. If someone was abused, they might understandably want no part in events related to the abuser. The author's mom is grieving but also relying on Jeff, which adds to the emotional weight.\n\nThe author's intention was to help their mom, which is a good motive. But they also had to confront Jeff, which Jeff reacted angrily to. The key here is whether the author had the right to pressure Jeff into helping, given Jeff's history. \n\nLegally and ethically, family members aren't obligated to help with funerals unless there's a specific agreement or financial responsibility. However, family dynamics are more complex. The author might feel it's their duty to support their mom, but forcing Jeff to participate, especially after trauma, could be seen as insensitive.\n\nAlso, the author didn't ask Jeff's perspective before assuming he should help. Understanding Jeff's reasons for not wanting to participate is important. The author's approach might have been confrontational, leading to Jeff's outburst. It's possible the author didn't consider that Jeff might need to set boundaries for his own mental health.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intentions were partly good (helping mom), but the method of confrontation without considering Jeff's trauma might be the issue. So, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were trying to mediate, but they might have handled it poorly by not respecting Jeff's boundaries. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering all factors. Jeff's refusal is a result of his past, so the author might not be entirely at fault. \n\nBut since the question is about obligation, the author might have incorrectly assumed Jeff's duty. So, the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for trying to help, but maybe the approach could be questioned. However, the core of the issue is Jeff's right to refuse due to his experiences. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for expecting Jeff to help, but the situation is nuanced. The answer is B.\n"
