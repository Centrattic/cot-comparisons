Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother he should help with their dad's funeral despite the abuse.\n\nFirst, the situation: The dad was abusive towards Jeff, especially when drunk. The author wasn't around for that much as they were younger. Now the dad is dead, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to tell him he should help for Mom's sake, but Jeff got angry and refused. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to push Jeff.\n\nSo, the key points here are the brother's past trauma and the author's intention to support their mom. The author might feel that family should come together, but Jeff has valid reasons to be upset. The question is about obligation versus personal choice.\n\nOn one hand, the author might think it's fair for Jeff to help, especially since it's a family event. On the other hand, Jeff has a history of abuse and might not want to participate because of that. The author's approach might have been confrontational, telling Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" which could have been dismissive of Jeff's feelings.\n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. Obligation versus empathy. The author's intention was to help Mom, but maybe they didn't take into account Jeff's trauma. Maybe the author should have suggested other ways for Jeff to show support if he's not willing to help with the logistics. The author might have made Jeff feel blamed, leading to his anger.\n\nBut at the same time, the author might not have realized the depth of Jeff's resentment. The answer depends on whether the author was wrong to impose their view without understanding Jeff's perspective. The author's action was to mediate between Jeff and Mom, but maybe the method was wrong. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but they could have handled it better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they pushed Jeff to fulfill an obligation without considering his trauma, maybe there's some fault. But it's a nuanced situation. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, because they were trying to help their mom, but they could have been more empathetic. The community often leans towards understanding the trauma aspect, so maybe the answer is B.\n"
