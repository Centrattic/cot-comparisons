Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their father's funeral, despite the father's abusive past.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The father was abusive to the brother, Jeff, when he was younger. He drank a lot and was violent. The author was born later, and the father mellowed out, becoming less abusive. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been in contact. The father is now dead, and the author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to convince Jeff, but Jeff was angry and refused. The author is torn between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's pain.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's intention was to help their mom by getting Jeff involved. But Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate due to past trauma. The author might not have considered how triggering this request could be for Jeff. However, the author tried to mediate and explain that Mom is hurting. \n\nOn one hand, pushing someone to be involved in a funeral of an abuser can be very stressful and might not be fair. On the other hand, the author is trying to support their mom. The key points are the author's intent versus the outcome. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to mediate, but maybe could have handled it more sensitively. However, given the context, the author's actions seem reasonable. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
