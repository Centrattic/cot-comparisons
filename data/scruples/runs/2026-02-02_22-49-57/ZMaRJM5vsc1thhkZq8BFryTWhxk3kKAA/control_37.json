I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the provided long post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-distance relationship where the man is considering pursuing other relationships while still being involved with his current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author met a girl online, they were in a long-distance relationship, had a meet-up, and he's now feeling conflicted about his feelings. He's worried about his growing attachment and wants to gain experience with other girls so he doesn't \"mess it up\" with a future partner. He doesn't want to break up with her but also doesn't want to cheat. The main question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to maintain this relationship while pursuing others.\n\nLooking at the situation, the author hasn't been entirely honest with his feelings. When the girl expressed her love, he didn't reciprocate but didn't clarify his intentions either. He's in a committed relationship (even if it's long-distance) and is considering pursuing others, which might be a form of emotional cheating. The fact that he bought a train ticket for her to visit and they spent intimate time together suggests a level of commitment, yet he's not sure about his own feelings. \n\nThe user is asking if he's the asshole (AITA). The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key factors here are honesty, commitment, and emotional integrity. In a relationship, even a long-distance one, both parties have expectations. If the author isn't committed and is using this as a way to gain experience for a future relationship, that's a form of emotional manipulation. He's keeping the girl in a limbo state where she's emotionally invested, and he's not being upfront about his intentions to pursue others. This can lead to hurt and broken trust, which is a significant issue.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions he doesn't want to cheat but feels he might if he continues. This internal conflict shows he recognizes the problem but isn't taking action to prevent it. The ethical thing would be to be honest with the girl about his intentions and either commit to the relationship or end it respectfully. By continuing the relationship under false pretenses, he's being deceptive, which makes him the asshole.\n"
