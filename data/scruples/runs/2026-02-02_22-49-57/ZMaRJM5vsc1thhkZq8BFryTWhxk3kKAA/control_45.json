I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The author started a relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They didn't meet for a while, and he was scared of her becoming too attached. Then, after some time, they reconnect, she expresses love, they meet up, have a good time, and now he's conflicted. He doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up but also feels the need to pursue other relationships to gain experience for his future \"soulmate.\"\n\nKey points here are the long-distance aspect, his fear of commitment, and his intention to explore other relationships. In a committed relationship, even if it's long-distance, being exclusive is usually expected. The author isn't upfront about his intentions to pursue others, which could be deceitful. Also, his main reason for maintaining the relationship is to avoid hurting her, but he's not addressing the fact that keeping her in the dark about his plans might be more harmful. \n\nHe's using the idea of preparing for a future partner as justification, but that's a bit of an excuse. Healthy relationships require honesty and mutual respect. By continuing the relationship while planning to be with others, he's being dishonest. Even if he's not cheating yet, the setup is for infidelity. The girl is clearly invested and loves him, so keeping her in a situation where he's not committed is unfair. \n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because he's not being honest and is maintaining a relationship under false pretenses while intending to pursue others, which can lead to emotional harm.\n"
