I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The situation is a little complex.\n\nFirst, the author is in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They've been talking for a year, met up, had a good time, and she's in love with him. The author is unsure about his feelings and is worried about the future. He's also considering pursuing other relationships because he wants to gain experience before finding his \"soulmate.\" \n\nThe key points here are whether the author is being deceptive or taking advantage of the girl. The author hasn't committed to the relationship beyond what seems to be a casual, long-distance setup. However, the girl is emotionally invested, and he's planning to meet again. If he's pursuing other girls while maintaining this relationship, that could be seen as leading her on, especially since she's expressed love and he hasn't reciprocated. \n\nThe author mentions that he's in a shared house and hasn't broken up with her yet because he doesn't want to hurt her. This suggests he's aware that his actions could be causing emotional harm. His intention to pursue others while keeping the current relationship active might be considered a lack of commitment. If the relationship is supposed to be monogamous and he's not being honest about pursuing others, that's a problem. \n\nThe question is whether he's at fault. If he's not in a committed, monogamous relationship and is being transparent about his intentions, maybe it's not his fault. But if he's given her reasons to believe they're exclusive and he's not being honest about seeing others, then he's in the wrong. The original post doesn't clarify if the relationship is defined as non-exclusive. However, given that she bought a train ticket to visit him and there's emotional intimacy involved, it's likely she expects some level of exclusivity. If he's not honest with her about his intentions to pursue others, that's deceitful. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is being honest and respectful in his communication with the girl. If he's leading her on without clear boundaries, then he's in the wrong. If he's upfront about his intentions, maybe not. The post doesn't mention him being transparent about pursuing others, which suggests he's keeping it a secret. That deception would make him at fault.\n"
