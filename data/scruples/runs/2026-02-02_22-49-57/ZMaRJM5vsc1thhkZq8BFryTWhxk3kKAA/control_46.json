I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a long-distance relationship where they met through Tinder, had a lot of communication, met in person, had a good time, and now the author is conflicted because he's developing stronger feelings but also wants to pursue other girls.\n\nFirst, the key points: They were in a long-distance relationship, she stayed with him in his room, they had sex, and he's now worried about his growing feelings. He mentions wanting to gain experience with other girls so he doesn't \"fuck it up\" with a future partner. But he's not okay with cheating, so he's conflicted.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. In a relationship, even if it's long-distance, there are certain expectations. If he's in a relationship, pursuing other people would be considered cheating, which is generally wrong. But does he even consider himself in a committed relationship with her?\n\nThe user says they were planning to meet, met, had sex, and she said she loves him. But he didn't say it back. However, they were in a shared house, she stayed in his room. That sounds like a physical relationship, maybe an emotional one too. So if they're in a relationship, then pursuing others would be wrong. But maybe they never officially defined it as a committed relationship. The user might be treating it as casual, but the girl might see it as more serious. If he's not in a committed relationship, then pursuing others might not be his fault. But if she believes they're in a relationship, then he's leading her on and that's wrong.\n\nAlso, he's aware that if he breaks up with her now, it would hurt her. But he's not sure if he wants to. He's also conflicted about his own feelings. The fact that he's trying to manage his emotions and not want to hurt her might mitigate some blame, but if he's not honest with her about his intentions, that's where the problem lies. If he's not committed and wants to keep the door open for others, but she's in love with him, he's using her and that's wrong.\n\nSo the main issue is whether he's being deceptive or not. If the relationship is open and both parties are okay with it, then it's not his fault. But if it's implied to be exclusive and he's not honest about pursuing others, then he is at fault. The user hasn't clarified with her about his intentions, which is a problem. He's also keeping her on a pedestal without committing, which can be seen as emotionally manipulative. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he's not being honest and is leading her on while planning to pursue others, which is a breach of trust and commitment.\n"
