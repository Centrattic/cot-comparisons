I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, he's in a long-distance relationship with this girl he met on Tinder. They haven't met in person until recently, and after meeting, he realizes his feelings might be growing, but he's also scared of getting too attached. Meanwhile, he wants to keep the relationship going but also wants to pursue other girls for experience before finding his \"one.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of their relationship. The user mentions that they met online, became attached, had a long-distance relationship, met in person, had sex, and planned future meetings. She even told him she loves him. If they're in a committed relationship, then pursuing others would be a problem. But if it's not exclusive, maybe he's not in the wrong. Wait, but the user didn't mention if they discussed exclusivity. That's a key point. If they're not in a monogamous relationship, then maybe he's not cheating. However, if the relationship is assumed to be exclusive, then pursuing others would be wrong.\n\nAnother angle: his initial hesitation and fear of commitment led him to give her the cold shoulder before. Now, after meeting and developing feelings, he's conflicted. He doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up but also doesn't see her as a long-term partner. His mindset is about gaining experience with other girls before settling down. That seems like emotional manipulation or being inconsiderate of her feelings. She's invested a lot, including time and money for the visit, and he's not sure if he can commit. That's a red flag.\n\nAlso, after she told him she loves him, he didn't reciprocate, but they continued the relationship. If he's not ready to commit, he should be honest. However, by continuing the relationship without full commitment, he might be leading her on. Even if it's not a formal relationship, he's acting like it is. So, even if they aren't exclusive, keeping her in a loop where she thinks there's potential for more, while he's planning to pursue others, is deceitful.\n\nThe key here is communication. If he hasn't established boundaries or discussed exclusivity, then both parties might be unclear. But the author is using her affection as a reason not to break up, which shows he's prioritizing his own desires over her emotional well-being. That's a sign of being in the wrong. So, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because he's not honest about his intentions and is potentially leading her on while planning to pursue others, which is dishonest and harmful.\n"
