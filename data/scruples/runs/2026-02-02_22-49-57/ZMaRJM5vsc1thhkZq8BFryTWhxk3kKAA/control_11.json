I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this long post is in the wrong. The author is in a long-distance relationship and considering pursuing other relationships. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author met a girl online, and she became very attached. He wasn't sure about his feelings and gave her the cold shoulder. Then, after some time, they reconnect, she says she loves him, and they plan a meetup. After the visit, he feels his feelings have grown, but he's worried it's not sustainable. He's also thinking about pursuing other girls because he wants experience before settling down with \"the one.\" The main question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to keep this relationship while also looking for others.\n\nHmm. In a relationship, even if it's a long-distance one, there are expectations of exclusivity. If the author isn't in a monogamous agreement and is actively pursuing others, that could be a problem. But the post doesn't mention if he's already committed to being exclusive with her. However, he did say they were planning to meet and she bought a ticket. It seems like they were in a relationship, at least in his mind.\n\nHe mentions that after meeting her, his feelings grew, but he's scared of being in a real relationship. He's thinking about how to break up without hurting her, but also not ready to commit. Meanwhile, he wants to experiment with other girls. That sounds like emotional manipulation. He's leading her on, making her believe there's a future, but not being honest about his intentions. That's not fair to her. She put in effort, bought a ticket, had a close relationship, and he's considering using her while also seeing others. Even if he's not cheating physically, emotionally he's not being truthful. So, yes, he's in the wrong because he's not honest and is using her for experience. The answer should be A.\n"
