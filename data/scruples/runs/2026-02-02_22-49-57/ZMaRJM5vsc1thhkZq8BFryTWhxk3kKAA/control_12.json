I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old guy who had a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They didn't meet for a while, and he was scared of her becoming too attached. Then they reconnected, planned a visit, had a good time, and she's now into him. He's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure of the relationship. He also mentions his belief that he should gain experience with other girls before finding \"the one,\" but doesn't want to cheat. The key issue is whether he's being unfair by keeping her while seeing others.\n\nNow, the core of the problem here is about honesty and commitment. The author hasn't explicitly stated to the girl that their relationship is exclusive. If he's not in a committed, exclusive relationship, then pursuing others might not be wrong from a moral standpoint. However, if there's an unspoken expectation of exclusivity, then his actions could be problematic. The user says he's keeping the relationship going but also wanting to pursue others, which might be a form of emotional manipulation or leading her on if she's under the impression they're in a monogamous relationship.\n\nThe girl bought a train ticket, stayed in his room, and they had intimate moments. This suggests that there's a level of seriousness and emotional investment from her side. The author, on the other hand, is hesitant about committing and is planning to see other girls. This could be considered emotionally dishonest because he's not being transparent about his intentions. Even if he's not in a formal commitment, the way he's handling the relationship might be leading her to believe that they're an item, which would make pursuing others while doing that a breach of trust and respect.\n\nAlso, the author's justification is that he's trying to gain experience for future relationships. That's his personal reasoning, but if it's causing harm to the other person involved, it's a problem. The girl has expressed love, and he hasn't reciprocated, yet he's keeping the relationship active. This could be seen as using her for emotional or physical connection without the intention of a real commitment, which is a common point of contention in these kinds of scenarios.\n\nIn terms of ethical standards, many would argue that if someone is in a relationship\u2014whether long-distance or not\u2014maintaining exclusivity is expected. Even if it's not officially labeled as a relationship, the actions (like intimate visits, planning future meetings) can imply exclusivity. The author's plan to pursue other girls while maintaining this connection is likely to be seen as deceptive and unfair to the girl who is invested in the relationship. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not being honest about his intentions and is potentially leading her on while planning to be with others.\n"
