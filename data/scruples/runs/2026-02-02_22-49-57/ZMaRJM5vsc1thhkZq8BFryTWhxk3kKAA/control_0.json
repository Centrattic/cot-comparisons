I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author is in a long-distance relationship with a girl they met on Tinder. They had a connection, met up, had a good time, and she's really into him. But he's not sure about his feelings and is worried about the future. He's also thinking about pursuing other girls, not wanting to commit yet because he wants to gain experience before finding his \"soulmate.\" \n\nNow, the key points here are the expectations of both parties. The woman in the relationship has expressed love, which the author hasn't reciprocated fully. He's keeping her at a distance to avoid getting too deep into a relationship he thinks might not last. At the same time, he's considering pursuing others. That sounds like emotional unavailability and possibly emotional cheating.\n\nIn most relationships, whether it's long-distance or not, honesty is crucial. If the author is not committed and is planning to pursue others, that's a big issue. Even if he's not physically cheating, emotionally cheating by leading her on while having intentions to be with others is wrong. The woman has invested a lot emotionally, and he's not being transparent about his feelings and intentions. \n\nAlso, the author's mindset of wanting to \"get experience\" before committing is problematic because it sets a precedent of using relationships for practice, which can be hurtful to partners. The woman might believe they are in a monogamous relationship, which the author is violating by considering others. \n\nSo even though the author doesn't want to hurt her and is trying to manage his feelings, his actions (pursuing others) are still deceitful. The answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's being dishonest and emotionally manipulative.\n"
