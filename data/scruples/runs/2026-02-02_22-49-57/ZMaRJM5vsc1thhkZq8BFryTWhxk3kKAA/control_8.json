I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The situation details someone in their early 20s who had a relationship with a girl, broke it off, then reconnected later. They met in person, had a good time, and now the author is feeling conflicted. They don't want to commit fully and are considering pursuing other relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the scenario. The key points are the long-distance relationship, the emotional attachment from the other person, the author's fear of commitment, and their desire to explore other relationships without cheating. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, relationships typically require mutual consent and clear communication. If the author is in a committed relationship, pursuing others would be wrong. However, the author's situation isn't entirely clear. They mention that the girl had a boyfriend at some point, but it's not stated if there's a current commitment. The author also says they haven't said \"I love you\" and are hesitant to commit. That suggests the relationship might not be officially monogamous.\n\nBut the issue here is that the author is maintaining a relationship with someone who's clearly invested and affectionate, while also considering pursuing others. Even if there's no explicit agreement on exclusivity, the author might be leading the girl on. If the girl believes they are in a relationship where monogamy is expected, then the author's actions could be seen as deceptive or manipulative.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they want to gain experience before committing to a long-term relationship. However, this doesn't justify potentially misleading someone else. The girl has expressed love and is planning visits, which implies emotional investment. The author's hesitation to commit now, while still keeping her around, could cause emotional harm if they eventually decide to move on or pursue others.\n\nAnother angle is the author's fear of breaking her heart. While they don't want to hurt her, continuing the relationship under the premise of possibly being exclusive might be unfair. The author might need to have an honest conversation about their intentions. If they can't commit, it's better to be upfront rather than string her along.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, even in casual relationships, transparency is key. If the author isn't willing to commit and is considering other relationships, they might need to be honest about their intentions from the start. Otherwise, they risk being in the wrong by not setting clear boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is maintaining a relationship with a girl who's emotionally invested, planning future visits, and expressing love, while also considering pursuing others. If there's any implication that the relationship is exclusive or committed, then the author is in the wrong by not being upfront. If the relationship isn't exclusive, then the author's actions might be within their rights, but there's still a responsibility to communicate clearly to avoid misunderstandings. Since the author hasn't clarified their intentions and is keeping the girl involved while planning to pursue others, they might be in the wrong by not being honest from the beginning.\n"
