I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The author is a 22-year-old guy who met a girl on Tinder. They had a long-distance relationship, met in person, and things were good. However, he's now feeling conflicted because he's afraid his feelings will grow too strong and he doesn't want to commit long-term. He also mentions his mindset of wanting to gain experience with other girls before finding \"the one.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship's nature. The user's post says they were in a long-distance relationship, which typically implies some level of exclusivity. The key point is whether the author is being honest with his partner. If he's not in a monogamous relationship and isn't upfront about his intentions to pursue others, that's a problem. However, if he's not in a committed relationship and is clear about his goals, maybe it's different.\n\nThe author mentions he hasn't said he loves her back and has been cautious, but they are planning future meetups. The issue is that he's now considering pursuing other girls while maintaining this relationship. The problem here is about consent and honesty. If the relationship is supposed to be exclusive and he's not telling her he's seeing others, that's deceptive. On the other hand, if it's casual and both parties know the expectations, it's different. \n\nThe author also says he doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up, but he's not sure if he's ready for a serious commitment. His approach of waiting to see if things cool down might be avoiding the hard conversation. Ethically, he should communicate his intentions clearly. If he's not committed to a monogamous relationship and his partner is, then he's in the wrong. If both are open to non-monogamy, maybe not. But from the given info, the author doesn't mention discussing this with his partner. \n\nSo, without clear communication and mutual understanding, pursuing other girls while in a relationship (even long-distance) is generally considered dishonest. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not being transparent about his intentions and may be leading the girl on, which can cause emotional harm.\n"
