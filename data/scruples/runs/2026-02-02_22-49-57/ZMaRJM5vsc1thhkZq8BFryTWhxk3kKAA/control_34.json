I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a long-distance relationship where the guy is maintaining it but also considering pursuing other girls. He's 22, and he's trying to gain experience for when he finds his \"one.\" The key points here are about honesty and commitment in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the guy met a girl online, they talked for two months, she became attached, but he wasn't sure about his feelings. He pulled away, which might have caused her some confusion. Then, after some time, they reconnect, she confesses her love, he doesn't reciprocate but they plan to meet. They spend three days together, have sex, and now he's feeling conflicted. He realizes he's developed feelings but doesn't want a long-term commitment. He's also considering seeing other girls but doesn't want to cheat.\n\nThe main issue is whether it's wrong to be in a relationship while seeing others. If there's no mutual exclusivity agreed upon, then technically, he's not cheating if it's an open relationship. However, the problem here is that the girl seems to have strong feelings and expressed love. If the guy isn't in a position to reciprocate or commit, he might be leading her on. Even if he's not cheating, he's not being honest about his intentions. The girl might believe she's in a monogamous relationship, while he's considering seeing others. That's a breach of trust and honesty, which are crucial in relationships. \n\nHe also mentions not wanting to break up with her because he doesn't want to hurt her, but he's aware that his feelings might grow more, making a breakup harder. His reasoning about gaining experience for the future is a bit self-serving and might not justify his actions. The girl deserves to know his intentions upfront. If he's not willing to commit or is open to seeing others, he should have communicated that from the start. By not doing so, he's keeping her in a situation where she might be emotionally invested without full transparency.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not being honest about his intentions and is potentially leading the girl on. Even if he's not cheating, the lack of communication and the consideration of seeing others while she's emotionally invested makes him the asshole here.\n"
