I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The author is a 22-year-old guy who's been in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They've met once, had a good time, but he's concerned that his feelings might grow too strong and he doesn't want to get too serious. He also wants to pursue other girls but doesn't want to cheat. He's trying to figure out if he's the asshole for wanting to keep the relationship going while also looking elsewhere.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The relationship is long-distance, and they've only met once. The author hasn't committed to a monogamous relationship, but he's also not clear about his intentions. The girl is very affectionate and has even said she loves him, but the author hasn't reciprocated. He's afraid he might hurt her if he breaks up with her now, so he's keeping things going. Meanwhile, he's considering pursuing other girls but not wanting to cheat. \n\nThe main issue here is about honesty and consent. If the relationship isn't monogamous, then technically the author isn't cheating by pursuing others. However, the girl believes she's in a relationship with him, especially after she expressed her feelings and bought a train ticket to visit him. If the author isn't committed to monogamy and hasn't communicated that, then he's misleading her. The problem is that he's leading her on without being honest about his intentions. \n\nHe mentions he's not looking for a long-term partner yet and wants to gain experience. But the girl has invested emotionally and financially (buying a ticket) and expects some level of commitment. The author's fear of hurting her by ending things might be valid, but that's not a reason to continue the relationship without being transparent. If he's not willing to be monogamous or commit, he should have communicated that upfront. \n\nSo, the key factors are consent and communication. If the relationship is supposed to be exclusive and the author isn't honest about his intentions to pursue others, then he's in the wrong. However, if the relationship was never established as monogamous, then he's not cheating. But since the girl has shown strong commitment and the author hasn't clarified his boundaries, he's being dishonest. Therefore, the answer is likely A\u2014he's in the wrong.\n"
