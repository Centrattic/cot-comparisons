I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, he's in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met online. They haven't met in person until recently, and after a few months, he started giving her the cold shoulder because he was scared she was getting too attached. Then, after some time, she texts him again, and they reconnect. She ends up visiting him, and they spend time together, including having sex. He's now worried about his feelings growing stronger and not wanting to commit, so he's thinking about pursuing other girls while keeping her in the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining the relationship while pursuing others. The key here is whether he's being honest with the girl. If they're in a monogamous relationship, then pursuing others would be cheating. However, if the relationship is not monogamous and both parties are aware, then maybe it's okay. But the problem here is that the author hasn't communicated his intentions clearly.\n\nHe mentions that he's afraid of her falling in love with him and that he doesn't want to break up with her because she's fun. His reasoning is that he wants to gain experience before finding a future partner. That sounds like he's using her for experience without considering her feelings. Also, he hasn't been honest about his intentions right from the start. When she expressed love for him, he didn't reciprocate and maybe that set the relationship on uncertain terms. But then, after spending time together, he's still not being honest about his plans to pursue others.\n\nAnother angle is the lack of communication. If he's going to pursue other relationships, he needs to inform her. If he's not, then he's being deceitful. The fact that he's in a long-distance relationship adds complexity, but that doesn't excuse dishonesty. He's also causing her emotional harm by leading her on without clear boundaries. Even though he says he doesn't want to hurt her, his actions are setting her up for potential hurt when the truth comes out.\n\nHe also bought a train ticket and stayed in his room with her, which implies a level of commitment he's not ready to handle. By not being upfront about his intentions, he's being manipulative. The core issue is honesty and mutual consent. If he can't be honest and they're in a monogamous relationship, he's in the wrong. If the relationship was never monogamous, then maybe not. But based on the information given, there's no indication that they discussed non-monogamy. Therefore, the author is being dishonest and is in the wrong.\n"
