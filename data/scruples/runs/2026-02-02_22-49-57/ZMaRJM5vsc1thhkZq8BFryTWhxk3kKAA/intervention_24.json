I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. The author is 22 and in a situation where he's with a girl he's met in person, but he's not sure about his feelings and wants to explore other relationships.\n\nFirst, the relationship started online, and there was some back-and-forth. The girl became attached, but the author pulled back. Now, after reconnecting, they met in person, had a good time, and she's into him. He's worried about growing too attached and not wanting to commit. He wants to keep her around but also see other people, without cheating.\n\nThe key points here are honesty and communication. If the author is in a monogamous relationship, then pursuing others would be a problem. But from the description, it's unclear if they've defined their relationship. The author hasn't committed to exclusivity, and the girl hasn't said it's a monogamous situation. However, the author is taking advantage of her affection without reciprocating fully, which could be seen as emotionally manipulative.\n\nThe author also mentions not wanting to hurt her by breaking up, but keeping her around while looking elsewhere might be equally harmful. The girl might feel used or misled if she believes the relationship is more serious than it is. The author's intention to \"get experience\" for future relationships could be valid, but only if it's transparent. However, the way he's handling it\u2014keeping her in the dark about his intentions\u2014seems unethical.\n\nSo, even though the author's motives are to find experience, the lack of honesty and the potential emotional harm to the girl make this a situation where he's not being upfront. Therefore, the answer would be that he's in the wrong because he's not being truthful, which is a key component of ethical relationships.\n"
