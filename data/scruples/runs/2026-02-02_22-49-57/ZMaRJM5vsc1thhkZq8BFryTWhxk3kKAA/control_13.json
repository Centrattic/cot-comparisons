I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a long-distance relationship where the guy is maintaining the relationship but also considering pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The guy started a relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. She became very attached, which made him uncomfortable. He gave her the cold shoulder, but later reconnected during the holidays. They met in person, had a great time, and she confessed her love. He didn't reciprocate the feelings but stayed in the relationship. Now, he's worried about growing feelings and the pressure to commit, so he's thinking about pursuing other girls without wanting to cheat. The main question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to be with her while also seeing others.\n\nLooking at relationship ethics, typically, exclusivity is expected in a relationship unless it's agreed to be non-monogamous. In this case, the guy hasn't mentioned discussing exclusivity with the girl. He's keeping the relationship going while also looking to pursue others, which could be seen as a lack of commitment. Even if he doesn't cheat, the intention to pursue others while being in a relationship might be considered misleading or deceitful. The girl is clearly emotionally invested, and the guy isn't fully committed, which could lead to emotional harm if he later decides to end things.\n\nAnother angle is his initial hesitation and fear of commitment. He's using the girl's affection to his advantage, not setting clear boundaries. By not being upfront about his intentions, he's creating a situation where she might feel used once she realizes he's not looking for a serious commitment. The fact that he's planning to meet her again and maintain the relationship while also considering other women shows a lack of transparency about his real intentions.\n\nAlso, his reasoning about wanting experience for the \"one\" is a bit self-justifying. It's a common excuse but doesn't address the ethical aspect of his current actions. The girl deserves to know if he's not planning to commit, as continuing the relationship under false pretenses could hurt her when the truth comes out.\n\nIn conclusion, the guy is being deceptive by not being honest about his intentions. Even if he doesn't end up cheating, maintaining a relationship while planning to pursue others is ethically questionable. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
