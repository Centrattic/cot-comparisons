I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The author is 22, and the situation started a year ago with a girl he met on Tinder. She became very attached, which made him uncomfortable, so he gave her the cold shoulder. Later, after some time, they reconnected, she told him she loves him, and they met up in person. Now, he's feeling conflicted because his feelings have grown, but he doesn't want a serious relationship yet, so he's considering pursuing others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their current relationship. The user mentions that the girl is affectionate and has bought a train ticket to visit him. She's clearly invested in the relationship, even though she had a boyfriend in between. The author is worried about not being able to commit fully and the potential pressure of her feelings. He also wants to gain experience with other girls before finding his \"one.\"\n\nNow, the key points here are: Is the author in a monogamous relationship? If yes, then pursuing others would be cheating. However, the user didn't specify if they've defined the relationship as exclusive. The author says they're planning to meet again but hasn't mentioned if they've discussed exclusivity. Without that, maybe it's not cheating, but it's still ethically questionable if he's leading her on without clear boundaries.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that after meeting her, his feelings grew, but he's still not ready for commitment. He might be using her for emotional connection while planning to move on, which could be hurtful if she's expecting more. The user argues the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to think about consent and honesty. If he hasn't told her he's not looking for a serious relationship and is planning to pursue others, that's a problem. The author's intention to break up later might be kind, but it's still a form of emotional manipulation if he's not upfront.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether there's an expectation of exclusivity. If the relationship is open, then it's okay. But if it's implied monogamy and the author is planning to be with others, that's where the issue lies. The author hasn't clarified his intentions, which might be the real problem here. Therefore, he's at least partially in the wrong for not being honest and potentially leading her on.\n"
