I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and pursuing other girls. The scenario is detailed, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is in a long-distance relationship where they've met and had a physical relationship. The girl has expressed love, but the author hasn't reciprocated and is afraid of developing deeper feelings. They also mention wanting to gain experience with other girls for future commitment, but don't want to cheat. The key issue here is whether the author is being deceptive or not.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. The author hasn't explicitly mentioned the girl's boundaries. If the relationship is monogamous, pursuing others would be a problem. However, if the author is being upfront about their intentions to explore other relationships, maybe it's different. The problem arises if the author is leading the girl on, making her believe they can have a committed relationship when they're not fully committed themselves.\n\nThe author mentions they feel pressure from the girl's affection and fear hurting her if they break up. That shows they care about her feelings, but they might not be acting in her best interest. If the author is not honest about their intention to pursue others, they could be manipulating the situation, which is unethical.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about wanting to \"practice\" for a future relationship is a bit self-serving. It's using the current relationship as a trial, which isn't fair to the girl. Healthy relationships require mutual understanding and respect. If the author isn't willing to commit and isn't honest about that from the start, they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is in a relationship where they're not being transparent about their intentions to pursue others, which can be seen as deceitful. Even if they don't cheat now, leading someone on without full honesty is unethical. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
