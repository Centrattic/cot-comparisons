I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and pursuing other girls. The author is a 22-year-old male who had a relationship that started online. He was initially scared of the girl becoming too attached, so he gave her the cold shoulder. After some time, he reconnects with her, and they become close again. She tells him she loves him, but he doesn't reciprocate and they plan to meet. They have a good time, but after she leaves, he's conflicted because his feelings grew. He's worried about continuing the relationship because he doesn't want to end up with someone who isn't his \"soulmate,\" so he wants to pursue other girls. He's trying to avoid cheating but feels like he might if he keeps the current relationship. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The relationship was long-distance, and they met in person. The girl was very affectionate and declared her love. The author didn't reciprocate but explained why. They had a physical relationship, which adds another layer. The key issue here is whether having a committed relationship while pursuing others is dishonest or unethical.\n\nIn traditional monogamous relationships, being in a relationship while dating others is considered cheating. But the author hasn't explicitly stated the relationship's status. The girl might assume it's exclusive since they met, had sex, and planned visits. If the author is pursuing other girls without her knowledge, that's a problem. Even if he's not physically with others yet, his intent to pursue others while in a relationship where she has feelings for him is a red flag.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to gain experience for future relationships. However, this seems like using her for his own benefit without considering her feelings. He also mentions not wanting to hurt her by breaking up, but by continuing the relationship while seeking others, he's setting himself up for potential emotional harm to her later. This could be seen as inconsiderate and manipulative.\n\nMoreover, the author's fear of being in a long-term relationship might not be a valid excuse for leading someone on. If he's not ready to commit, he should have been honest from the start. The fact that he's maintaining the relationship while planning to pursue others suggests he's not being truthful about his intentions. Trust is a big component in relationships, and if he isn't upfront about wanting to be with others, that's a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that at 22, he's still figuring things out and isn't ready for a serious commitment. But even so, relationships require mutual understanding and consent. If he's not in a monogamous relationship, that should be clear. Since he hasn't clarified his intentions, and she's clearly invested, he's putting her in a position where her feelings might be hurt either way.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is in the wrong because he's engaging in a relationship without full transparency about his intentions, which can lead to emotional harm. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
