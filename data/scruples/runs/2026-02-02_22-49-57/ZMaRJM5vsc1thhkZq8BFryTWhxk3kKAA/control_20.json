I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They've been communicating for a year, met up, shared intimate moments, and she's bought a train ticket to see him again. The author feels conflicted because his feelings have grown, but he's also afraid of a future with her and wants to date others to gain experience before settling down. He's worried about cheating if he continues the relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author mentions that he's not in love and that his goal is to gain experience with multiple partners to prepare for a future \"soulmate.\" However, he's in a relationship where the other person is clearly emotionally invested\u2014she bought a ticket, stayed in his room, and declared love. The author is considering breaking up with her later but doesn't want to hurt her now. \n\nBut here's the catch: if the relationship is monogamous, then pursuing other girls would be a breach of trust. The author hasn't mentioned discussing boundaries with his partner. If she believes they're in an exclusive relationship, then his actions are dishonest and manipulative. The fact that he's planning to break up with her when things get too intense suggests he's not committed and is using her, which is unethical. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that he needs experience before finding his \"one\" is a common justification, but it doesn't make it right. Emotional harm is still caused to the partner who believes they're in a meaningful relationship. The author's fear of future commitment doesn't excuse his current behavior. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he's maintaining a potentially exclusive relationship while planning to pursue others, without transparency. That's not respecting his partner's feelings and is likely to cause her harm, which he acknowledges but still proceeds with. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
