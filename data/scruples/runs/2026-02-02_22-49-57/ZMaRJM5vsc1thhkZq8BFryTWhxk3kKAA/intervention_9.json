I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, he's in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They've been talking for a year, even though he wasn't sure about her feelings at first. Then they met up, had a nice time, and now she's visiting him. After the visit, he's feeling conflicted because he's developed stronger feelings but also doesn't want to commit long-term. Plus, he wants to pursue other girls to gain experience for his future \"soulmate.\"\n\nFirst, let's consider the relationship context. The author acknowledges that they haven't met until recently, but they were communicating for a long time. They had a physical relationship during her visit. Now he's thinking about other girls. The key issue here is whether he's being honest about his intentions. If he's not in a monogamous relationship and is open about pursuing others, maybe it's not wrong. But if he's leading her on or not being transparent, that's a problem.\n\nHe mentions that she's \"really into him\" and he doesn't want to break her heart. However, by continuing the relationship while also looking for others, he's setting himself up for potential emotional harm to both parties. The main question is about consent and communication. If both parties agreed to a non-monogamous arrangement, then it's different. But the author doesn't mention discussing this with her. He's keeping it a secret, which implies he's not honest about his intentions.\n\nAlso, he's using her for experience, which might be seen as objectifying her. Even if his intentions are good, he's not considering her feelings and wants. The fact that he fears committing but continues the relationship anyway could be seen as manipulative. People deserve to know if their partner is not emotionally available or is planning to pursue others. \n\nAnother angle: long-distance relationships are hard enough, and adding the stress of potential infidelity without communication is unfair. The author is putting off breaking up, which is hurting her emotionally. Even if he's not cheating yet, his mindset is that he wants to \"try other girls,\" which is a red flag. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not being truthful with his partner about his intentions, is leading her on, and isn't respecting her emotional needs. That makes him the asshole in this situation. Answer A.\n"
