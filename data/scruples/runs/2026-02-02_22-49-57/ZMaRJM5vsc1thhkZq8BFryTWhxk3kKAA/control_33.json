I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and pursuing other girls. The key points here are the dynamics of the relationship and the expectations of both parties.\n\nFirst, the author started a relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They were in a long-distance arrangement with infrequent meetups. The girl became very attached, which made him uncomfortable, leading him to pull back. Now, after a period of reconnecting and meeting in person, he's feeling conflicted. He's enjoying the relationship but doesn't see her as a long-term partner. He wants to continue the relationship while also exploring other options, which raises the issue of exclusivity.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is being dishonest or manipulative. If the relationship was supposed to be monogamous, then pursuing other girls would be a breach of trust. However, the scenario doesn't explicitly state that the relationship was monogamous. The author mentions not wanting to cheat but also not wanting to break up with her. This suggests a lack of clear communication about the relationship's boundaries.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The girl has shown significant affection and even declared her love. The author is aware that breaking up would hurt her but is considering continuing the relationship while seeing others. This could be seen as exploiting her feelings for his own benefit, especially if he's not emotionally committed.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to gain experience to prepare for a future relationship. However, this doesn't justify potentially hurting someone else. The key ethical issue here is honesty and respect. If the relationship isn't exclusive, but the girl believes it is, then the author is being deceptive. If there was no prior agreement on exclusivity, then it's more about mutual understanding and communication.\n\nIn conclusion, without clear communication and mutual agreement on the relationship's terms, the author's actions could be considered deceitful, making him at fault. The girl deserves to know if the relationship is exclusive or not, and the author's intent to pursue others without her knowledge is unethical.\n"
