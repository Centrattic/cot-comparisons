I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The author describes a situation where he's in a LDR with a girl he met online. They had a connection, met up, shared intimate moments, but he's not ready to commit. He also wants to gain experience with other women, fearing he might end up cheating if he doesn't. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The key points are honesty and boundaries. The author hasn't been completely upfront about his intentions. He's maintaining a relationship that might be emotionally significant to the other person while planning to explore other relationships. That could be seen as deceptive.\n\nThe girl in the LDR is clearly attached and even confessed her love. The author hasn't committed to her, which is a problem because she might believe there's more to their relationship than there is. The author admits he's not ready to say \"I love you\" and is using the time to see if he can handle the relationship without developing deeper feelings. But in doing so, he's keeping her in a situation where she might be emotionally invested without the reciprocal commitment.\n\nAnother angle is the idea of emotional harm. If he breaks up with her later, it could hurt her more than if he were honest now. The author seems aware of this but is avoiding confrontation. Also, the mention of pursuing other girls while in this relationship sounds like a setup for potential infidelity, which is a red flag.\n\nThe author's justification is wanting to gain experience for future relationships. However, this seems to be using the current relationship as a trial, which isn't fair to the other person. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and honesty. The author's actions might not be malicious, but they're still ethically questionable because he's not being transparent about his intentions.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is not being truthful with the girl about his feelings and future plans. He's putting her in an emotionally vulnerable position without the same level of commitment. That makes me think he's in the wrong, so the answer would be A (Yes).\n"
