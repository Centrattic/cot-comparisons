I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. The author is 22 and has a history with this girl. They met on Tinder, she got attached quickly, then he pulled away. Now they've reunited, she's in love, they met up, and he's feeling conflicted because he's developed feelings but doesn't want to commit. He wants to keep the relationship going for a bit but also wants to explore other relationships to gain experience before finding the \"one.\"\n\nFirst, I need to determine if being in a relationship while pursuing others is considered cheating. In most relationships, exclusivity is implied unless otherwise agreed. The author is in a long-distance relationship with this girl, and he's considering pursuing others. That sounds like cheating unless both parties are in an open relationship. The problem is, there's no mention of the girl agreeing to an open relationship. She expressed love for him, and he didn't reciprocate, but maintained the relationship. Now he's thinking about being with others, which could be deceitful if she's not aware or doesn't consent.\n\nAlso, the author mentions fearing that his feelings might deepen, leading to a potential breakup that could hurt her. But instead of breaking up, he's choosing to keep her while pursuing others. That seems unfair to her because she's emotionally invested and likely expects monogamy. The author's intention to gain experience before committing to someone else might be valid for him, but it's not the other person's responsibility to wait for him to be ready. \n\nAnother angle: the girl had a boyfriend at some point, but the timeline isn't clear. The author reached out after she was available again. However, the main issue is the current situation where he's considering being with others while in a relationship with her. Even if there's no formal commitment, long-distance relationships often come with mutual expectations of fidelity. The author's actions would likely hurt her if discovered, which makes it unethical. \n\nSo, considering that the author hasn't discussed his intentions with the girl and is planning to pursue others without her consent, he's violating the trust and mutual expectations of exclusivity. Therefore, he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
