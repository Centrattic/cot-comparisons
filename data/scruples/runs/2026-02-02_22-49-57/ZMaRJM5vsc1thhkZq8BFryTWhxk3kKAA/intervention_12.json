I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy in a long-distance relationship who's considering pursuing other relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The guy met a girl on Tinder, they had a long-distance relationship. They met up, had a good time, and she's very affectionate. He feels pressured because he's worried about growing more attached and not being able to handle it. He's also thinking about pursuing other girls to gain experience before finding his \"one,\" but doesn't want to cheat. He's conflicted about breaking up with her to avoid hurting her feelings.\n\nNow, the question is if he's in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants my opinion. Let's break it down. In a committed relationship, being with other people would be cheating. But the author hasn't officially labeled their relationship as exclusive. They were in a long-distance, met up, had sex, but the author hasn't committed to being exclusive. The girl is very into him, but he's not sure if he's into her enough for a long-term commitment. He's using her for experience while not wanting to hurt her. \n\nIs it wrong to pursue others if you're not in a monogamous relationship? If the relationship isn't exclusive, then maybe not. But the problem is that the girl thinks she's in a relationship. She said she loves him, and he didn't reciprocate. Keeping her around while planning to move on might be emotionally manipulative. The author is aware that he's not looking for a long-term commitment but is leading her on. That could be considered wrong because he's not being honest about his intentions. Even if the relationship isn't labeled exclusive, if there's an implicit understanding of exclusivity, then pursuing others could still be deceitful.\n\nAlso, the author is worried about hurting her if he breaks up, but he's not taking responsibility for his actions. He's choosing to stay with her for fun but not for a future, which could lead to emotional harm. The key issue is honesty and transparency. If he's not ready to commit and wants to explore other options, he should communicate that clearly. Otherwise, he's setting her up for disappointment. So, while he might not be in a cheating scenario if the relationship isn't exclusive, he's still being dishonest about his intentions, which is wrong. Therefore, the answer would be that he is in the wrong.\n"
