I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the long post is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. The author is 22, and the situation started with a girl he met on Tinder. They had a long-distance relationship, met up, had a great time, and now he's conflicted because he's into other girls and doesn't want to commit yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is in a long-distance relationship where he's emotionally invested but not ready for a serious commitment. He's also interested in pursuing other relationships. The main issue is whether this is ethical or not.\n\nIn many relationships, exclusivity is expected. If the author hasn't discussed with his current partner that he's open to seeing others, then pursuing other girls might be considered a breach of trust. However, if it's a casual or non-exclusive arrangement from the start, that's different. The post doesn't mention whether they've discussed boundaries. The girl said she loves him, but he didn't reciprocate, which might mean the relationship isn't on solid ground emotionally for him. \n\nHe's also worried about breaking her heart if he ends things now. But he's not willing to commit, which could lead to a situation where he's leading her on. The idea of \"trying other girls\" to find his future partner raises questions about his intentions. It's possible he's using this girl for experience, which could be manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, he's 22 and still figuring out what he wants. It's not uncommon for young people to explore relationships before settling down. However, honesty is key. If he's not being transparent about his intentions, that's where the problem lies. If he hasn't communicated his openness to seeing others, then yes, he's in the wrong because it's a commitment issue. But if both parties are aware and okay with it, then it's not. The post doesn't clarify that they've discussed exclusivity. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on communication. Without knowing if they've discussed boundaries, the author might be in the wrong for not being upfront. Leading someone to believe there's a future when there isn't can be hurtful. Therefore, even if his intentions are good, the lack of communication and potential emotional harm suggest he's in the wrong.\n"
