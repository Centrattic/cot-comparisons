I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and also pursuing other girls. The author is 22 and doesn't consider himself an asshole. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author started a relationship with a girl on Tinder. She became very attached, which made him uncomfortable. He then gave her the cold shoulder, which caused the relationship to dwindle. Later, they reconnected, and she ended up in his house for three days. They had a good time, but now he's feeling conflicted because his feelings have grown, and he's worried about the future. He also mentions wanting to gain experience with other girls so he doesn't mess things up with the \"one,\" but he doesn't want to cheat. The key point is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to keep the relationship while pursuing others.\n\nLooking at the core issue: the author is in a long-distance relationship that's turning into something more serious, but he's also considering pursuing other relationships. The question is about fidelity and honesty. In most relationships, even long-distance ones, exclusivity is expected. If the author isn't in an open relationship and hasn't communicated with his partner that he's seeing others, then pursuing other girls would be a breach of trust. However, the author hasn't explicitly stated whether the relationship is monogamous. Since he hasn't confirmed, maybe he's not in an exclusive relationship yet. But after the three-day visit where they had sex, his feelings have grown, and he's considering continuing the relationship while also dating others.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to gain experience for his future relationship. However, this is a common justification for infidelity. The problem is that if he's in a committed relationship, even if it's not traditional, pursuing others could hurt his partner. The girl in question has expressed her feelings (she loves him), so there's an emotional investment. The author is aware that breaking up would hurt her, but he's not sure if he wants to commit. This could be seen as emotionally manipulating her by keeping her in a relationship where he's not fully committed.\n\nAnother angle is the long-distance aspect. The author hasn't mentioned whether there's a formal commitment between them. If they're just seeing each other occasionally, maybe it's more casual. But after the visit, things became more intense. If the author is planning to maintain the relationship while seeing others, that's a problem if the relationship is supposed to be exclusive. The key here is the lack of communication about boundaries. If the author hasn't discussed with his partner whether the relationship is open or monogamous, then his actions could be considered dishonest.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because he's considering pursuing other relationships without the consent or knowledge of his partner, which could lead to emotional harm. Even if the relationship isn't formally established, the level of intimacy and emotional connection suggests that exclusivity is expected. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
