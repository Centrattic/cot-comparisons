I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a 22-year-old guy who's in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met online. They've seen each other once, and after that, his feelings have grown, but he's worried about the future. He's contemplating whether he's in the wrong for wanting to maintain this relationship while also pursuing other girls, without cheating. \n\nFirst, the key points here are the dynamics of their relationship. They've never had a face-to-face meeting until a recent three-day visit. The woman is very affectionate and has expressed love, but the man hasn't returned those feelings. He's concerned about potentially leading her on because he's not ready for a committed, long-term relationship. However, he's also not sure if breaking up with her is the right move because it might hurt her.\n\nThe user's main question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to stay with her while also exploring other relationships. The crux here is about honesty and communication. If he's not in a monogamous relationship and hasn't set clear boundaries, then pursuing others might be acceptable. But if he's leading her on by making her believe there's a future when he's not committed, that's a problem.\n\nHe mentions he's not interested in cheating but wants to gain experience before a serious relationship. That's a common sentiment, but the issue is whether he's being transparent with the woman. Since they haven't had a physical relationship before the visit, maybe he's not in a formal relationship either. However, after the visit and the intimate moments, their dynamic has shifted. If he's not planning to commit and is keeping other options open, then he's not being honest about his intentions, which could be considered leading her on.\n\nAnother angle is the power imbalance. She's more emotionally invested, and he's holding back. If he continues to engage with her without a clear commitment, he might be exploiting her feelings. Even if he doesn't cheat, the emotional investment from her side without reciprocation could be harmful.\n\nThe user argues he's not an asshole, but the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The key here is about honesty. If he's not upfront about his intentions and continues to maintain the relationship with the expectation of exclusivity, then he's in the wrong. However, if they're both open to non-monogamous arrangements and he's clear about his intentions, then it's different. The text doesn't mention any prior agreement about exclusivity, so it's likely he's been vague about his plans, leading her to believe there's a future when he's not set on it. That would make him the asshole because he's not being truthful, which can cause emotional harm.\n"
