I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The author is 22, had a connection with a girl through Tinder, they met up, she stayed with him, and now he's unsure if he's being unfair. The key points here are his intentions and the relationship's nature.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girl lives 100 miles away and they plan to meet occasionally. The relationship is long-distance, which can be challenging. The author feels that the girl is very affectionate and might be over-attached. He's worried about his own feelings growing and not wanting to lead her on. He also states his belief that he should get experience with multiple partners before settling down, so he's trying to pursue others but doesn't want to cheat.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether keeping the relationship while pursuing others is wrong. In a monogamous relationship, being with someone else would be cheating. However, if the relationship is non-monogamous and both parties are aware and okay with it, then it's different. The problem here is that the author hasn't mentioned discussing boundaries with the girl. The girl's affection and the fact that she stayed in his room suggest a level of intimacy that might imply exclusivity.\n\nThe author is also conflicted about his feelings and doesn't want to hurt her. He's considering breaking up but not sure yet. The key is whether the girl is aware that the author is seeing others. If not, then he's being deceptive and is in the wrong. If she's okay with it, then maybe not. However, since the author hasn't clarified this, it's likely that the girl believes the relationship is exclusive. Therefore, pursuing others without her knowledge would be dishonest and harmful.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's potentially misleading the girl by not setting clear boundaries and possibly leading her to believe in exclusivity while he's seeing others. Honesty and communication are essential in any relationship to ensure both parties are on the same page.\n"
