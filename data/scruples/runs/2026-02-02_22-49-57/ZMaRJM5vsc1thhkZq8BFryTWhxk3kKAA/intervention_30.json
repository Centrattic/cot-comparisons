I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. The author is 22, and the situation involves a girl he met on Tinder a year ago. They had a long-distance relationship, met up for three days, and she stayed in his room. He's now worried about his growing feelings and the pressure, so he wants to continue the relationship but also try other girls to gain experience for his future partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The author didn't explicitly state that it's an exclusive relationship. The girl said she loves him, but the author didn't reciprocate. However, they were planning to meet, had intimate moments, and the author refers to her as \"his girl.\" That might imply some level of exclusivity, even if it's not clearly defined. \n\nIn many relationships, especially long-distance ones, exclusivity is expected but not always discussed. If the author is engaging with other girls, even if it's just pursuing them, that could be a problem if the relationship isn't open. The key here is whether there was an agreement about exclusivity. Since the author didn't mention discussing this, it's possible he's assuming it's okay to pursue others, which could be a breach of trust if the girl expected monogamy.\n\nAlso, the author mentions not wanting to break up because he doesn't want to hurt her. That suggests he cares about her feelings, but continuing the relationship while seeing others could be emotionally manipulative. Even if he's not in love, maintaining an emotional connection while being physically distant and emotionally invested elsewhere could harm her in the long run.\n\nAnother angle is the author's reasoning for wanting to pursue other girls\u2014to gain experience for his future partner. While that's a common thought, using current relationships as practice without the other person's knowledge or consent isn't ethical. It's important that both parties are on the same page about the relationship's boundaries. If the girl believes it's exclusive and the author isn't, that's a fundamental mismatch leading to potential harm.\n\nSo, putting it all together: if the relationship is exclusive and the author is pursuing others without her knowledge or consent, he's in the wrong. If it's not exclusive, he still needs to be transparent. The lack of clear communication and the potential for emotional harm point towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
