I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. Let me read the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old guy who had a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They never met at first, but she became very attached. He pulled away because he was scared. Then, after some time, they reconnected, she bought a train ticket to visit him, they spent three days together, had sex, and she said she loves him. He didn't reciprocate but explained why. Now, after she left, he's feeling conflicted. He's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure from the relationship. He wants to \"get as much experience as possible\" before finding his future partner, so he wants to pursue other girls but doesn't want to cheat. The question is whether he's in the wrong for keeping the relationship while also looking for others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of their relationship. They were in a long-distance relationship, which typically implies exclusivity. If the author is in a committed relationship, then pursuing others would be cheating, which is wrong. But the situation is a bit unclear. The original post says they had a long-distance relationship, but it's not explicitly stated if they were in a monogamous relationship. The girl bought a ticket to visit him, stayed in his room, and he's considering the possibility of future relationships. The author says he's not cheating yet but fears he will if he continues. So, he's in a relationship but also has intentions to pursue others. That sounds like emotional infidelity or at least a lack of commitment.\n\nEven if the relationship wasn't formally monogamous, the girl expressed love for him, and he didn't reciprocate but didn't end it. If he's planning to see other people while continuing the relationship, that's not being honest with his partner. She might believe they're exclusive, and he's planning to see others, which would be deceptive. The author's main justification is that he's trying to gain experience for his \"future soulmate,\" but that doesn't excuse being in a relationship with someone else while pursuing others. It's using the current relationship as a stepping stone without considering the other person's feelings.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he doesn't want to break up with her because it might hurt her, but if he's not fully committed, he's setting her up for emotional pain eventually. It's better to be honest from the start if he's not ready for a committed relationship. The fact that he continues the relationship despite knowing it's leading him to potential infidelity shows a lack of integrity. The answer would likely be A (he's in the wrong) because maintaining a relationship with the intent to pursue others is dishonest and unfair to his current partner.\n"
