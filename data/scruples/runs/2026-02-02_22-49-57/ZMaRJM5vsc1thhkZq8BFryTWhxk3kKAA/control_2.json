I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 22, in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They've been talking for a while, met up, had intimate moments, but he's unsure about his feelings. He's worried about growing more attached and not wanting to hurt her by breaking up. At the same time, he wants to gain experience with other girls to avoid messing up a future serious relationship. The main question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to keep this relationship while pursuing others.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the relationship is already established, there's mutual affection, and he's considering pursuing others. If the relationship is monogamous, then pursuing others would be a problem. But does he have an open relationship? The original post doesn't mention that they discussed boundaries. The author didn't say he's in an open relationship, so he's likely in a monogamous one. \n\nCheating is usually when someone is in a committed relationship and has affairs. But here, he's not exactly cheating; he's pursuing other girls while maintaining the current relationship. However, if the relationship is monogamous, this would be a breach of trust. But he's not physically cheating yet, just considering it. \n\nHe's also planning to break up eventually but doesn't want to hurt her now. That's a bit of a red flag because he's leading her on. Even if he's not ready for commitment, keeping her in the dark about his intentions could be hurtful. \n\nThe user's mindset is that he wants to \"gain experience\" before a future serious relationship. This implies he's not committed to the current one, which might make the current relationship unethical. If he's not going to be honest about his intentions from the start, then he's being unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, he hasn't actually cheated yet. He's expressing concern about his feelings and future actions. But the intention to pursue others while in a relationship, even if not yet acting on it, might still be considered wrong. \n\nIn many relationships, emotional exclusivity is expected. Pursuing others could be emotional cheating. So, even if he's not physically cheating, the author is potentially violating the trust and emotional boundaries of the relationship. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he's in a committed (even if not formally defined) relationship and is planning to pursue others, which could lead to cheating. He's also not being honest about his intentions, leading her on. So the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
