I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-distance relationship where the man is considering pursuing other women while maintaining the current relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The man and woman started a relationship through Tinder, had a long-distance setup, met in person, and she's very attached. He's unsure about his feelings, doesn't want to commit, and is thinking about pursuing other women to gain experience for a future \"soulmate.\" He doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up but fears cheating if he continues.\n\nThe main issue here is whether maintaining a relationship while pursuing others is ethical. The woman is clearly invested, as she bought a ticket to visit him and expressed her love. If the man isn't fully committed and is open to other relationships, that's a form of emotional infidelity. Even if he's not physically cheating, the emotional investment in another person while being in a relationship is a problem. \n\nThe author's justification is that he's not ready for a long-term commitment and wants to \"get experience.\" However, if the woman believes they are in a monogamous relationship, then his actions are misleading. The problem is whether there's an understanding of exclusivity. If the relationship isn't defined as open or non-monogamous, then pursuing others could be considered cheating. \n\nAlso, the man is in a position where he's causing potential emotional harm. He acknowledges that breaking up would hurt her, but he's not honest about his intentions. This lack of honesty can lead to manipulation, as he's keeping her in a situation where she might be harmed later. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he's not being truthful about his intentions, is potentially misleading the woman, and is setting up a situation where either he or she will get hurt. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
