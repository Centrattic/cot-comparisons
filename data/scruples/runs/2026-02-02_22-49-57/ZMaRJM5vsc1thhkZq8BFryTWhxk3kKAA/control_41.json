I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author is in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met online. They had a connection, spent time together, and she's very affectionate. He feels conflicted because he's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure she's putting on him. He also mentions he wants to gain experience with other girls before settling down, but he doesn't want to cheat. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to keep the relationship while pursuing others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The author mentions they haven't met in person initially but started talking a lot. Then after some time, they meet for three days. He's in a long-distance setup, so maybe the physical separation is making it harder for him to manage his feelings. He's worried about breaking up with her because he doesn't want to hurt her, but he also doesn't see her as a future partner.\n\nThe key points here are honesty and consent. If the author is in an exclusive relationship with her and he's also pursuing others, that would typically be considered cheating. However, the user hasn't explicitly said it's exclusive. The author hasn't mentioned discussing the status of the relationship. For example, if they're just friends with benefits or casually dating without exclusivity, then pursuing others might be okay. But if it's an exclusive relationship and he's not being honest about his intentions to be with others, that's where the problem lies.\n\nThe author's main issue is his fear of commitment and wanting to explore other relationships before settling down. He's concerned about his own feelings and the pressure from her. The problem is whether he's being transparent with her. If he's leading her on by not being clear about his intentions and his plan to pursue others, that's dishonest and could be considered wrong. Even if he's not in an exclusive relationship, if she believes it's more serious than it is, he's not being honest.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. She's very attached and affectionate, which might mean he's taking advantage of her feelings while not being fully committed. The author might be emotionally manipulating her by keeping her on a string, not giving her the closure she needs. He's also not considering her perspective\u2014how she might feel if she found out he's interested in others. The fact that he's keeping her in a long-distance, intermittent relationship while planning to pursue other women could be hurtful.\n\nSo, putting it all together: if the relationship is exclusive and he's not honest about his intentions to pursue others, he's in the wrong. If it's not exclusive, then maybe not. But the way he describes it, he's keeping her in a situation where she's emotionally invested without setting clear boundaries. The author might be avoiding responsibility by not having an honest conversation with her. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not being transparent and may be leading her on.\n"
