I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy started a relationship with a girl online, which became serious. They met, had a good time, and she's now in love. He's considering pursuing other girls to gain experience, not wanting to commit yet. The question is about whether he's being unfair.\n\nLooking at the details, he's in a committed situation with this girl. They're planning to meet again, and she's very affectionate. He's worried about his feelings growing and not wanting to be in a long-term relationship, so he's thinking of moving on. However, he also doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up now. \n\nThe key points are: Is it okay to be in a relationship while seeing others? The author says he's not cheating, just pursuing other girls. But if he's in a monogamous relationship, that's not acceptable. However, if it's an open relationship, maybe it's okay. The problem is that he hasn't discussed this with the girl. She might not know he's seeing others, which could be misleading. \n\nAlso, he's using her for experience, which could be seen as manipulative. He's not ready for a real relationship but is keeping her engaged, which could hurt her when he eventually leaves. Even though he's not cheating, the lack of honesty and the potential emotional harm make him responsible. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's maintaining a relationship under terms she might not agree to, without transparency, and is using her for his own needs without considering her feelings.\n"
