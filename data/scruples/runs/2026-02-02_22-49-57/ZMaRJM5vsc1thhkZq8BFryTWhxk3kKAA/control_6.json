I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to maintain a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The situation is that they met someone on Tinder, there was a lot of back and forth, they had a meeting, and now the author is conflicted because they're into the girl but also don't want to commit fully. The main question is about their decision to keep the relationship going while exploring others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author mentioned they had a long-distance relationship, met in person, had intimate moments, and the girl expressed love. The author feels they might not be her future partner but enjoys her company. They also have the mindset of gaining experience with other girls before committing to \"the one.\"\n\nNow, thinking about ethical standards. A relationship typically implies exclusivity. If the author is in a committed relationship, then pursuing others would be cheating. However, in this case, the author hasn't officially committed. They were in a long-distance relationship but hadn't made it exclusive? The girl bought a train ticket to visit him, stayed in his room, and they had sex. That seems like a romantic relationship, even if it's long-distance.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author is being honest. If they're not in a monogamous relationship and the girl isn't aware that the author is seeing others, then he's being deceptive. But if the relationship is open and mutual agreement to explore others, then maybe not. However, the author hasn't mentioned discussing this with the girl. The girl seems to have feelings for him and expressed love, so expecting her to know he's pursuing others would be unfair.\n\nThe author also mentions pressure from the girl's affections and fear of hurting her if they break up. They want to wait to see if things settle down. But if they're still pursuing others, they're not being truthful. That's a problem because it's leading to emotional harm for the girl if she's not aware. The author's intention to \"get experience\" suggests a lack of commitment and possibly using the relationship for personal gain, which is unethical.\n\nSo, even if the author isn't in a formal relationship, the actions they've taken (meeting up, intimacy) imply a level of commitment. By continuing to engage while pursuing others without transparency, they're being dishonest and potentially leading the girl on. That makes the author responsible for the emotional consequences, especially if the girl isn't aware of the author's intentions. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
