I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other women. The key points here are the context of the relationship and the intentions behind the author's actions.\n\nFirst, the author and the girl started talking on Tinder, and she became very attached, leading him to pull back. Then, after some time, they reconnect, she expresses love, and they meet. The author feels her affection is intense and fears commitment. He's now considering pursuing other relationships but doesn't want to cheat. The main issue is whether it's ethical to continue the current relationship while planning to date others.\n\nIn a committed relationship, exclusivity is usually expected. Even if it's a long-distance one, if both parties consider it a relationship, the author's intention to pursue others without transparency would be a problem. The author hasn't explicitly discussed his intentions with her, so she might not be aware he's not fully committed. This lack of honesty can be seen as a breach of trust. The author also mentions not wanting to hurt her, which suggests he's aware his actions could be harmful. \n\nHowever, if the relationship isn't mutually exclusive, then the author isn't in the wrong. The problem here is the ambiguity. The author's actions imply he's not ready for commitment, but he hasn't communicated that. It's important to consider whether the girl knows about his intentions. Since the author hasn't broken up with her and is planning to pursue others, it's possible he's leading her on. That would make him at fault for not being honest and for potentially using the relationship without full commitment.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the relationship was supposed to be exclusive. If it was, then yes, the author is in the wrong. If it wasn't, then maybe not. But since the girl expressed love and the author didn't reciprocate, yet continued the relationship, it's likely he's in the wrong for not being upfront and for not respecting her feelings by not committing or clearly stating his intentions. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
