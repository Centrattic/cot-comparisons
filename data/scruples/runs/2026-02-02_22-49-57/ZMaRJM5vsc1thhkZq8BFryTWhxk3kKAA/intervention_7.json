I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a long-distance relationship where the guy is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining this relationship. \n\nFirst, the guy and the girl started talking on Tinder, she became attached, he gave her the cold shoulder because he was scared. Then later, after some time, they reconnect, she says she loves him, he doesn't say it back but explains why. They meet up, spend time together, have sex, and he feels his feelings are growing. But he's worried that staying in the relationship might lead him to pursue other girls, which could hurt her.\n\nThe key points here are communication and honesty. The author mentions he hasn't been completely honest about his intentions. He's keeping her in the loop for the long term but also thinking about other girls. If the relationship is exclusive, then pursuing others would be cheating, which is definitely wrong. However, the author says he \"doesn't want to cheat,\" but he's considering it, which implies that he's not in a monogamous agreement. \n\nThe girl is clearly emotionally invested, as she said she loves him and bought a train ticket to visit. If the author isn't committed to an exclusive relationship and isn't upfront about his intentions, that's a problem. The author's reasoning is that he wants to gain experience for his future \"one,\" but that's using the girl for practice, which can be seen as manipulative and disrespectful. \n\nAlso, the author is creating emotional dependence in the girl without being clear about his own feelings and future plans. If he's going to pursue others, he should be honest from the start to avoid leading her on. The fact that he's feeling pressure to commit but isn't sure if she's his future partner suggests he's not being truthful with himself or her. \n\nSo, in a monogamous relationship, pursuing others is cheating. If it's not monogamous, then they should have discussed boundaries. Since the author hasn't clarified this and is keeping her in a situation where she's emotionally invested without mutual exclusivity, that's a breach of trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not being honest and is potentially leading her on for his own benefit.\n"
