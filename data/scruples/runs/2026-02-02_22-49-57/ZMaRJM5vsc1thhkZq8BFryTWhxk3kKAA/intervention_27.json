I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The author is 22, met a girl online, they had a connection but he was scared of getting too attached. They reconnected after some time, she fell in love, he didn't reciprocate, but they planned a visit. After meeting, he's now conflicted because he's developing feelings and wants to explore other relationships without cheating. He's worried about hurting her if he breaks up now but also doesn't want to commit fully.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about honesty and communication in relationships. If the author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, even if it's long-distance, pursuing other girls without her knowledge would be a problem. But the author mentions he's not cheating yet, but wants to pursue others. That implies he's in a monogamous relationship, which makes pursuing others unethical. However, the author hasn't confirmed the status of his relationship with the girl. She bought a train ticket, stayed in his room, and he's considering breaking up. \n\nWait, the author says he's not cheating yet but wants to pursue others. If he's in a committed relationship, then pursuing others would be wrong. However, he hasn't clarified if it's exclusive. The girl might think it's a monogamous relationship. Also, he's planning to break up eventually to avoid a future hurt. But the question is, is he in the wrong now for maintaining the relationship while looking to meet others. \n\nAnother angle: if the author hasn't established boundaries, like being non-monogamous, then pursuing others without her consent is wrong. However, if he's not in a committed relationship yet, maybe it's different. But the fact that they had plans, met up, and he's planning to break up might indicate he's leading her on. \n\nSo, the author's main issue is that he's not being honest about his intentions. If he's not ready for a committed relationship and is using her while also planning to move on, that's not ethical. The girl might not know he's open to other relationships. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not being transparent and is manipulating the situation to his advantage without considering her feelings.\n"
