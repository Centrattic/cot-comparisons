I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship where the author is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the current relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author met a girl online, they had a long-distance relationship with some on-again, off-again dynamics. The girl became very attached, and after reconnecting, they planned a visit where they had a good time. Now, the author is conflicted because he's developing stronger feelings but doesn't want a long-term commitment. He also mentions wanting to gain experience to prepare for his \"one true love\" and is considering pursuing other girls without cheating.\n\nThe key points here are honesty and consent. The author is not currently in a monogamous relationship, at least not in the traditional sense, since they met online and have only met once. But after the visit, the author feels the relationship might be more serious. If the author is considering pursuing others, he needs to be clear with his current partner about his intentions. Without that transparency, he could be leading her on, which would be dishonest.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not upfront about his intentions to explore other relationships, then he's being deceptive. Even if they're not in a formal, exclusive relationship, building emotional intimacy while planning to move on could hurt her. The author's plan to \"gain experience\" suggests he's not committed to a monogamous relationship, which the girl might not have agreed to. Therefore, he's not in the wrong if he communicates this clearly. But if he's keeping it a secret, then yes, he's being dishonest and manipulating her feelings, which makes him the asshole. \n\nBut the post doesn't mention if he's already discussed this with her. The author is aware that she's very affectionate and might get hurt if he breaks up later. That shows some consideration, but the act of pursuing others without her knowledge is still problematic. So, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) if he's not being honest. However, if the relationship wasn't exclusive from the start, then maybe not. The story isn't entirely clear on that. But given the context, most people would consider it wrong to pursue others without transparency. Hence, Answer A.\n"
