I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this long post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the author is keeping it going but also wanting to pursue other girls. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is 22, had a long-distance relationship that started online. The girl became attached, but he gave her the cold shoulder because he didn't want her to fall in love. Then, after some time, she reached out again, they reconnect, and she falls for him again. He doesn't reciprocate the love but stays with her, plans a meet-up, has a good time, and now feels conflicted. He's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure to break up, but doesn't want to hurt her. At the same time, he wants to pursue other girls to gain experience for future relationships but doesn't want to cheat.\n\nSo, the main question is whether he's in the wrong for maintaining the relationship while also pursuing others. The key here is whether the relationship is monogamous. If he's in a monogamous relationship and is planning to be with other people, that would be cheating and wrong. But if the relationship isn't monogamous and both parties are aware and okay with it, then it's different. However, the post doesn't mention any discussion about exclusivity. The author hasn't stated that they agreed to non-monogamy. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that he doesn't want to be with this girl long-term and wants experience for his future relationship. But he's keeping her in the dark, not being honest about his intentions. The girl is clearly emotionally invested, and he's using her for experience without reciprocating feelings. That's a problem. He's also not upfront about his desire to pursue others, which could lead to emotional harm if she's led to believe he's exclusive. \n\nSo, from a traditional standpoint, relationships usually require some level of honesty and mutual understanding. If he's not honest with her and is using her while planning to be with others, that's deceitful and wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not being truthful and is engaging in behavior that could hurt her without her consent.\n"
