I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nSo the author is a 22-year-old guy. He met a girl online a year ago, they talked for two months, she became very attached even though they haven't met. He got scared and pulled away. Ten months later, he reconnects with her, they talk a lot, she says she loves him, he doesn't say it back but they plan a meet-up. They spend three days together, have a good time, and then after she leaves, he feels conflicted. He's now considering pursuing other girls but doesn't want to cheat. He's worried about hurting her if he breaks up with her but isn't sure what to do.\n\nThe key points here are: He's in a relationship, even if it's not officially labeled, since they met in person and shared intimate moments. The problem is he's thinking about pursuing other girls. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, relationships typically involve mutual understanding and boundaries. If he's in a relationship with this girl, even if it's long-distance and not exclusive by agreement, pursuing others without her knowledge could be considered wrong. The author hasn't mentioned discussing exclusivity with her. If the relationship is supposed to be monogamous and he's actively seeking others, that's a breach of trust. However, if the relationship was casual or non-exclusive from the start, maybe not. But from the description, it seems like he's in a committed situation with her\u2014she's very attached, they've met in person, and he's the one hesitating. \n\nHe's also worried about breaking up with her because he doesn't want to hurt her. That shows he cares about her feelings, but his actions (pursuing others) could still be harmful. The dilemma is between his desire for experience and her emotional investment. \n\nSo, if the relationship is mutual but he's considering pursuing others without her knowledge or consent, then yes, he's in the wrong. Even if he's not in a formal relationship, the fact that they've met in person, had a physical relationship, and she's emotionally invested means that he should be honest about his intentions. Pursuing other girls while keeping this relationship could be deceitful. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to gain experience for the future, but that doesn't justify being in a relationship while misleading her. It's important to either be upfront about non-monogamy if that's the case or to end the relationship if he's not committed. Since he's not sure yet, but already considering breaking up later, it's better to be honest and not lead her on. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
