I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 22 and met a girl online. They had a connection, but he felt she was too attached, so he pulled back. Then, after some time, they reconnected, met in person, had a good time, and she ended up loving him. He didn't reciprocate the love but they continued a relationship. Now he's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure, so he wants to pursue other girls while keeping her.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are communication and honesty. The author hasn't been upfront about his intentions. The girl believes he's in a committed relationship, but he's planning to see others. That's a problem because in a relationship, especially a long-distance one, mutual expectations are crucial. If the author isn't in a monogamous relationship and isn't honest about it from the start, that's a breach of trust. \n\nEven though he didn't say he loved her, he's leading her on by maintaining the relationship. The fact that he's considering pursuing others while still engaged with her means he's not being transparent. The girl might not know that her relationship with him isn't exclusive, which is where the issue lies. \n\nThe author might think he's not doing anything wrong because he hasn't cheated yet, but the potential for cheating comes from not setting boundaries. The girl deserves to know if the relationship is exclusive or not. If he's not committed to exclusivity, he's misleading her. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not being honest about his intentions and is leading her on without clear communication about the relationship's nature.\n"
