I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a long-distance relationship where the guy is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining this relationship. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the guy met a girl on Tinder, and she became very attached without them meeting. He felt scared and pulled away. Then, after some time, she came to visit him, they had a good time, and she told him she loves him. He didn't reciprocate the feelings but explained why. Now, he's thinking about continuing the relationship but also exploring other relationships, which worries him about cheating.\n\nThe key points here are honesty and communication. In a relationship, even if it's long-distance, both parties should feel secure and not be led on. The guy isn't in a committed monogamous relationship because he hasn't defined it as such. However, if he's not clear about his intentions and continues to engage with her while pursuing others, that could be misleading.\n\nThe author mentions he's not monogamous by nature and wants experience before finding a long-term partner. But if he's not upfront with the girl about his intentions, he's being deceptive. The problem is that the girl might believe they're in a committed relationship, especially since she's made emotional investments like traveling to see him and telling him she loves him. If he continues without being honest, he could be leading her on, which is unethical.\n\nAlso, the fact that he hasn't broken up with her yet but is considering pursuing others is a red flag. Even if he doesn't want to hurt her, continuing the relationship without clear boundaries isn't fair. The author needs to communicate his intentions to avoid causing harm. If he's not ready for commitment and doesn't want to be exclusive, he should end things to prevent her from getting further attached. Otherwise, he's in the wrong because he's not being honest and is putting her in a position where she could get hurt.\n"
