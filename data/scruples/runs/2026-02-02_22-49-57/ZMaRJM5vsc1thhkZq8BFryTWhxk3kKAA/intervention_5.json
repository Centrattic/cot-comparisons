I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the long post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the author is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the relationship.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author met a girl online, they had a long-distance relationship, she became very attached, but the author was hesitant. After some time, they reconnect, she says she loves him, and they meet in person. Now, the author is afraid that their feelings might grow too strong, and he wants to gain experience with other girls to avoid making a mistake with a future partner. The main question is if it's wrong to keep the current relationship while pursuing others.\n\nSo, the main ethical issue here is about honesty and commitment. In a relationship, especially when there's physical intimacy involved, mutual understanding of the relationship's boundaries is crucial. The author mentions they haven't had a formal breakup but are in a long-distance setup. If they're not in an exclusive relationship, maybe it's different. But the way it's described, the girl seems to be in a monogamous relationship with the author, given that she had a boyfriend before and now they've met in person, shared intimate moments, and planned future meetings.\n\nThe author is considering pursuing others, which would be infidelity if they're in a committed relationship. The girl might believe they're exclusive, especially after she expressed love. The author's hesitation to reciprocate love but still maintaining the relationship could lead to emotional harm if he leaves later. Also, the idea that he's \"trying to gain experience\" implies he's not fully committed, which could be deceitful if the girl believes it's serious.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that the relationship isn't exclusive or that they haven't defined it as such. But given the context\u2014buying a train ticket, staying in his room, etc.\u2014it seems like they're treating it as a real relationship. The author's plan to pursue others while keeping this relationship could be seen as using her and not being honest about his intentions. That would make him the asshole because he's not being transparent and is potentially leading her on while planning to move on soon.\n\nSo, the conclusion here is that the author is in the wrong because he's maintaining a relationship under potentially false pretenses and planning to pursue others, which is dishonest if the relationship is expected to be monogamous.\n"
