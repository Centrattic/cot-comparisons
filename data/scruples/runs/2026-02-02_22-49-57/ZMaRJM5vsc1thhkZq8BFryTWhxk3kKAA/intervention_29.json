I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is in a long-distance relationship and considering pursuing other girls. They mention they don't want to cheat but feel they might if they keep the current relationship. They also have a fear of their feelings growing too much and not being able to handle it. \n\nFirst, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. They are in a relationship, even if it's long-distance and hasn't been physically together much. The key here is communication and mutual expectations. If the relationship is monogamous, then pursuing others would be a problem. But the author hasn't explicitly stated that they discussed any non-monogamous terms with their partner. \n\nThe original post says they haven't committed to a future with the girl and that they're using her for experience to avoid messing up with their \"future soulmate.\" That suggests they're not in a committed monogamous relationship. However, the girl might have different expectations, especially after expressing love and buying a ticket to visit. The author might be leading her on without being honest about their intentions. \n\nIf the author is in a monogamous relationship, pursuing others would be a breach of trust. But if the relationship is open or casual, it might be different. The problem is the author hasn't clarified their boundaries with the girl. They're also not being honest about their desire to explore other relationships, which could be manipulative or emotionally harmful to the girl.\n\nThe author's actions could hurt the girl if they continue without clear communication. They mention fearing breaking up because it would hurt her, but that's not a valid reason to stay in a relationship if it's not genuine. They need to be honest about their intentions to avoid leading her on. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is being deceptive or not. Since they're in a long-distance relationship and the girl has invested emotionally, continuing while pursuing others without clear boundaries is likely the wrong approach. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
