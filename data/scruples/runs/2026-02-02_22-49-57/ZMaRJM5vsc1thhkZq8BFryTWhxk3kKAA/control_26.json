I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship where the guy meets a girl online, they become close, have a meet-up, and after she leaves, he's conflicted about continuing the relationship while also wanting to pursue other girls.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The guy started a relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. She became very attached, which made him uncomfortable. He pulled back, then reconnected later. She told him she loves him, but he didn't reciprocate. They met in person, had a good time, and now he's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure. He also mentions wanting to keep this relationship while pursuing others, fearing he might cheat if he doesn't.\n\nNow, the core issue is whether it's wrong to maintain a relationship while pursuing others. The author is in a long-distance relationship, and he's not committed. He's also clear that he's not in love and is holding onto the relationship because he enjoys her company. However, he's conflicted about exploring other relationships without being dishonest.\n\nIn most relationships, especially romantic ones, there's an expectation of exclusivity. If the author isn't in a monogamous relationship and hasn't clearly communicated his intentions, then pursuing others could be deceitful. However, if the relationship was never defined as exclusive, maybe there's ambiguity. But the fact that the girl told him she loves him and he didn't reciprocate suggests that she might have had higher expectations. The author is using her for companionship while also not wanting to commit, which could be seen as emotionally manipulative. He's also keeping her on a pedestal to avoid hurting her feelings, which isn't fair to her. The key here is whether he's being honest about his intentions. If he's leading her on without intending to be exclusive, then he's in the wrong. He should either commit to a monogamous relationship or be upfront about his openness, but he's not doing either fully. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's not being honest and is using the relationship in a way that could harm her.\n"
