I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They haven't met until recently, and after spending time together, he's developed stronger feelings. But he's also worried about committing and wants to gain experience with other girls before finding a long-term partner. The key issue here is whether it's ethical for him to continue the relationship while pursuing others.\n\nThe author mentions that he hasn't explicitly defined their relationship. They were talking for two months, then he gave her the cold shoulder. Later, after reconnecting, she expressed love, and he didn't reciprocate but didn't end things. Now, after meeting in person and sharing intimate moments, he's unsure if he should continue. He's conflicted between not wanting to hurt her and his own need for experience.\n\nThe main ethical problem here is about honesty and consent. If the author is in a relationship, even if it's not officially labeled, he has a responsibility to be honest about his intentions. If he's planning to pursue other relationships while staying with her, that's a form of emotional cheating or at least being deceptive. The fact that he's holding out on saying he loves her but still engaging in a physical relationship might already be a red flag. \n\nAlso, the woman in question has bought a train ticket to visit him, indicating commitment. If the author isn't fully committed and is planning to move on, he's leading her on. The fact that he's considering breaking up later might be kind, but the lack of upfront honesty about his intentions is problematic. Relationships require mutual understanding and consent. If he's not ready to commit and is using her for experience, that's exploiting her feelings.\n\nMoreover, the author mentions that he feels pressured because she's into him. That pressure shouldn't be a reason to stay in the relationship if he's not ready to be exclusive. The right approach would be to communicate his boundaries clearly from the start. Even if the relationship isn't exclusive, he should have been upfront about his intentions to pursue others. Since he hasn't done that, he's in a gray area, but likely on the wrong side because he's not being transparent.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's not being honest about his intentions, is emotionally leading someone on, and planning to use the relationship for his own personal growth without considering her feelings and needs. The right thing would be to be upfront or end the relationship if he can't commit.\n"
