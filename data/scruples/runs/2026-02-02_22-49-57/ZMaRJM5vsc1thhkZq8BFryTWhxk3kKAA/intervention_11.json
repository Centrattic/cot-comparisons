I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. The original poster (AITA) is a 22-year-old guy who's been in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They had a connection, met up, and things went well. However, he's now worried about his growing feelings and fears that staying in the relationship might lead him to pursue others, even though he doesn't want to cheat.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The key points here are the nature of the relationship and the expectations of both parties. The author mentions they've been in a long-distance relationship, which typically requires a certain level of commitment and exclusivity. He also states that he's considering pursuing other girls while keeping this relationship, which raises questions about honesty and commitment.\n\nNow, looking at the author's reasoning: he feels that since he's young and wants to gain experience before finding a long-term partner, he's okay with keeping this relationship but also exploring others. However, he's aware that this might lead to cheating and is conflicted about breaking up with her because he doesn't want to hurt her.\n\nThe main ethical issue here is about honesty and mutual expectations. If the relationship is supposed to be exclusive, then pursuing others without disclosing this would be a breach of trust. The author hasn't mentioned whether he's been honest with the girl about his intentions. If he hasn't, then he's being deceptive, which is a problem. Even if he's not in a formal relationship, the way he describes the interactions (meeting up, intimate moments) suggests a level of exclusivity that might not align with his current plans to pursue others.\n\nAnother angle is emotional manipulation. The author is aware that the girl is very affectionate and might be emotionally invested. By maintaining the relationship while planning to pursue others, he could be leading her on, which is generally considered inconsiderate and hurtful. The girl's emotional well-being is at stake here, and the author is choosing not to break up because he doesn't want to hurt her, but his actions might be more harmful in the long run.\n\nAlso, the author's age and mindset are factors. At 22, he's young and exploring his relationships, but that doesn't automatically make his actions right. The key is whether he's being transparent. If he hasn't communicated his intentions to the girl, he's in the wrong. If he has, then it's a different scenario, but the post doesn't mention that.\n\nThe author's fear of commitment and desire for experience are personal issues, but they don't excuse dishonesty. The girl deserves to know where she stands, and keeping her in a situation where he's not fully committed could lead to more pain later. The author is essentially trying to balance his own desires with the girl's feelings, but without clear communication, he's not handling it ethically.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions involve a lack of honesty and potential emotional harm. Therefore, he is in the wrong because he's not being truthful with his partner and is leading her on without disclosing his intentions to pursue others. The answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
