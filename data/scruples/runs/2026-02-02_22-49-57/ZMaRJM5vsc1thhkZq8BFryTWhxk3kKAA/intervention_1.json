I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a long-distance relationship where the author is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the current relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The author met a girl online, they had a connection, but he wasn't sure about his feelings. He gave her the cold shoulder earlier because he was scared she'd fall in love. Now, after reconnecting, she's in love with him, and they had a nice visit. But he's worried about his growing feelings and not wanting to commit long-term. He wants to keep the relationship but also explore others to gain experience for his future \"one.\" \n\nThe main ethical issue here is honesty and commitment. The author is in a relationship, even if it's long-distance. If he's planning to pursue other girls, that's a problem unless both parties have agreed to an open relationship. From the description, there's no mention of any agreement about exclusivity. The girl expressed love, and he didn't reciprocate, but they're still together. If he continues the relationship while seeing others without her knowledge, that's cheating. \n\nAnother angle is the pressure he's causing. The girl is attached and might not realize he's not fully committed. The author mentions he doesn't want to hurt her, but he's conflicted. The ethical thing would be to be upfront about his intentions. If he can't commit, he should probably end things to prevent leading her on. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he's not being honest about his intentions and is likely leading the girl on while planning to pursue others. That's deceitful and could hurt her more in the long run. The answer should be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
