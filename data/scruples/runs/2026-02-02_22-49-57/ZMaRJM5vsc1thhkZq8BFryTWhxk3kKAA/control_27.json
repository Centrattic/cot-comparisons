I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy maintaining a long-distance relationship and also pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The guy met a girl on Tinder, she became attached but he wasn't sure about his feelings. He gave her the cold shoulder, then later reconnected during Christmas time. She told him she loved him, he didn't reciprocate but they met up and had a good time. Now he's feeling conflicted because he's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure, but he also wants to keep her around while pursuing others.\n\nThe main issue here is whether it's wrong to be in a relationship while pursuing others. The guy isn't explicitly cheating, but the intention to pursue other girls while in a relationship could be problematic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to keep the current relationship while also looking for others. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, if the relationship is monogamous and the guy is considering pursuing others, that's a violation of the agreement. However, if the relationship isn't exclusive, then maybe not. But in most cases, when someone starts a relationship, even a long-distance one, it's implied to be monogamous unless otherwise stated. The guy didn't clarify with the girl that he's open to other relationships, so pursuing others while in a relationship would be deceitful. \n\nAlso, the girl has a history, but the key point is the guy's current actions. He's keeping her in his life but not being transparent about his intentions to seek others. That could lead to emotional harm if she's invested and he's not. Even if he doesn't cheat, the emotional unavailability might be an issue. \n\nThe guy's reasoning is that he's trying to gain experience for \"the one,\" but that's a common excuse for avoiding commitment. It's also not fair to the girl if he's not willing to commit and is using her for experience. The fact that he's worried about hurting her if he breaks up but isn't honest about his intentions is a red flag. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because he's in a relationship where he's not being honest about his intentions to pursue others, which can hurt the girl emotionally. Even if he's not cheating, the lack of transparency and commitment is deceptive. So the answer should be A.\n"
