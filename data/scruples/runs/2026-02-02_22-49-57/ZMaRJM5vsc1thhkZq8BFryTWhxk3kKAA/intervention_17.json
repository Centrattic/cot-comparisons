I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old guy in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They've been talking for about a year, and even though they haven't met until recently, she became very attached. He was initially scared of her affection and then gave her the cold shoulder. Later, they reconnected, had a good time when she visited, and she told him she loves him. He didn't say it back but explained why. Now, after she left, he's feeling conflicted because his feelings for her have grown, and he's worried about the future. At the same time, he wants to pursue other girls to gain experience for his future relationship, but he doesn't want to cheat. He's asking if he's the asshole for wanting to keep the current relationship while also pursuing others.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. First, the relationship itself. They met online, had a long-distance relationship, met in person, and had a three-day visit. She's in love with him, but he hasn't reciprocated the love. Now he's worried about the future because he's developing feelings but isn't sure if they're serious. Meanwhile, he wants to date others for experience.\n\nThe key issue here is whether he's being honest with her about his intentions. He's keeping the relationship going but hasn't committed to her. Also, he's considering pursuing other relationships. In a standard monogamous relationship, pursuing others would be cheating. But the author mentioned he doesn't want to cheat. So maybe he's thinking of ending the current relationship and then pursuing others? However, he's not breaking up with her because he doesn't want to hurt her. That's a problem because if he's not in love and is keeping her on a string, that's not fair.\n\nHe also said he's in a long-distance relationship, which is hard on its own. Adding to that the fact that he's not fully committed and is planning to date others while in the relationship could be seen as dishonest. The girl put effort into the relationship, bought a train ticket, and expressed love. The author didn't reciprocate but kept the relationship going, which might be leading her on. Even if he's not cheating now, his future plans to date others before finding his \"one\" suggest he's not in a serious commitment with her. That's misleading because she's emotionally invested and might believe there's potential for a real future together.\n\nSo, the main points are: not being honest about his intentions, leading her on, and planning to pursue others while she's still committed to him. Even if he's not cheating currently, the lack of commitment and the intention to date others later (without her knowledge) could be considered unethical. The question is whether this makes him the asshole. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not being upfront with her about his goals. If he wants to pursue others, he should be in a non-monogamous relationship where both parties agree. Since he hasn't discussed this with her and is keeping her in the dark, he's not being truthful. It's not just about cheating; it's about honesty and respect for her feelings. She deserves to know his intentions before continuing the relationship. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
