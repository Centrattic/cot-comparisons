I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy met a girl online, they had a long-distance relationship, met in person, and she's very affectionate. He's unsure about his feelings and doesn't want to commit fully. He's considering pursuing other girls, not wanting to cheat but fearing he might. He's conflicted about breaking up with her to avoid hurting her because she's invested a lot.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is in a relationship, even if it's long-distance. If he's in a monogamous relationship, pursuing others would be a breach of trust. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user didn't mention if the relationship is monogamous. The post says they \"started talking\" and later met, but it's unclear if there were explicit boundaries. The author mentions he's not in a monogamous mindset, thinking he needs to gain experience for his future relationship. \n\nIf the relationship is supposed to be exclusive, then pursuing others would be a problem. However, if it's non-monogamous or casual, maybe not. The author didn't state that they agreed on open relationships. The girl seems to be very invested and even bought a ticket to visit him. She expressed love, which he didn't reciprocate. \n\nThe author's hesitation to commit and his plan to pursue others could be seen as leading her on. If he's not in a monogamous agreement, but she expects exclusivity, then he's in the wrong. He's also not honest about his intentions. He's worried about hurting her if he breaks up now, but that doesn't justify pursuing others. Honesty is key here. The fact that he's planning to pursue others while maintaining the relationship suggests he's using her, which is unethical if she expects exclusivity. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not being transparent about his intentions and is potentially leading her on while considering other relationships without her consent.\n"
