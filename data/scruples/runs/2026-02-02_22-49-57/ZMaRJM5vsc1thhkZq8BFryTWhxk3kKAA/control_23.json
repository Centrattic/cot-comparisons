I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and pursuing other girls. The author is a 22-year-old guy who had a relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They talked for a while, there was some attachment, then he pulled back because he was scared she might fall in love. Now, after reconnecting and meeting up, he feels his feelings have grown but is worried about the future. He wants to keep her while also pursuing others, fearing he might cheat if he doesn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They were in a long-distance relationship, met up, had intimacy, and he's not sure about his feelings. The key points here are communication and consent. Did the author and the girl have an open discussion about his intentions? If the relationship was exclusive, then pursuing others would be a problem. However, the author mentions that the girl bought a train ticket to visit him, which suggests some level of commitment. If he's maintaining an exclusive relationship while seeing others, that's cheating. But if it's non-exclusive, maybe not. However, the author's own statement about wanting to \"get as much experience as I can\" implies he's looking for casual encounters, which might not align with the girl's expectations. The girl said she loves him, and he didn't reciprocate. If she believes it's a serious relationship, then the author is in the wrong by not being honest about his intentions. Also, emotional manipulation could be a factor if he's leading her on. The author's fear of hurting her by breaking up might be a valid concern, but that doesn't justify staying in a relationship he's not committed to. So, the answer would likely be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not being truthful about his intentions and is potentially leading her on, which is unfair. Even if he's not cheating right now, his plans to pursue others while in a relationship where she has feelings for him is deceitful.\n"
