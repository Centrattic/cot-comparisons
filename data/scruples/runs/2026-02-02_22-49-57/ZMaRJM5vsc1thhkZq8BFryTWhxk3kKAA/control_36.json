I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a long-distance relationship where the guy met a girl online, they became attached, there was some on-again, off-again stuff, and now they've met up in person. The guy feels he's developing stronger feelings and is worried about not being able to commit long-term. At the same time, he wants to pursue other girls to gain experience for his future \"one,\" but he doesn't want to cheat. The key question is whether he's wrong for maintaining the relationship while also pursuing others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of their relationship. They were in a long-distance relationship, met up in person, had a romantic trip, shared intimate moments. If they were in a monogamous relationship, then pursuing others would be a breach of trust. But does the author have a clear understanding of the relationship's boundaries? The user mentions that they had planned to meet up, bought a train ticket, stayed in his room, etc. That sounds like a committed relationship, but maybe they never explicitly defined the relationship status. If it's an open relationship, then maybe it's okay, but if it's supposed to be exclusive, then he's in the wrong.\n\nThe author also says he's not ready to commit and wants to \"get as much experience as possible.\" That suggests he's treating this relationship as a way to gain experience for future relationships, which might be considered using the girl. Even if he's not cheating, the emotional investment and the fact that he's leading her on could be problematic. She's clearly attached and loves him, and he's not reciprocating the same level of commitment. That could be emotionally manipulative.\n\nAdditionally, he's worried about breaking up with her because it might hurt her, but he doesn't want to leave her hanging either. However, staying in a relationship where he's not emotionally available and planning to pursue others isn't fair to her. It's a form of emotional cheating, even if there's no physical infidelity. The girl deserves honesty and transparency. The author's plan to wait and see if things calm down isn't addressing the root issue; he needs to communicate his intentions clearly.\n\nSo, putting it all together: if the relationship is monogamous, then he's in the wrong for planning to be with others. If it's not, maybe not, but there's no indication they discussed an open arrangement. His actions are likely leading her to believe they're in a committed relationship, which he's not prepared for, making him the asshole for not being honest about his intentions and potentially leading her on.\n"
