I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points from the author's story. He met a girl online, they talked a lot, but he pulled back because he felt she was getting too attached. After a period of not talking, they reconnected, she moved in with him for three days, and she expressed love. He didn't reciprocate but said he didn't want to say it. Now he's feeling conflicted because his feelings have grown, but he's worried about a future relationship and wants to gain experience with other girls. He doesn't want to break up with her but is considering it to avoid hurting her later.\n\nThe central issue here is whether the author is being deceptive or manipulative. The girl believes she's in a relationship, given that she bought a train ticket, stayed in his room, and he's maintaining contact. However, the author isn't in a committed relationship and is considering pursuing others. This creates a problem because if he's not honest about his intentions, he's leading her on. Even if he doesn't plan to cheat, he's not being upfront about his need to explore other relationships, which could lead to emotional harm if she's under the impression that their connection is more serious than it is.\n\nThe author's justification is that he doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up now, but he's also not committing to her. This is a classic example of emotional dishonesty. Relationships, even long-distance ones, require mutual understanding and honesty. If the author isn't willing to commit and is holding out for a future partner, he should communicate that. Otherwise, he's putting her in a position where she might invest emotionally without full knowledge of his intentions.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions not wanting to cheat but feeling like he might if he continues. This suggests he's aware of the potential for harm. By not addressing this with her, he's risking her feelings and his own integrity. The key here is whether he's being transparent. If he's not upfront, he's in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy and could be causing her emotional distress down the line.\n\nSo, even though his intentions might not be malicious, the lack of honesty and commitment makes him the asshole. The answer should be A.\n"
