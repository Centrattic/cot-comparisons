I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other women. The author is 22, and the situation started when he met a girl on Tinder. She became very attached, which made him uncomfortable, leading him to pull away. After some time, they reconnect, she visits him, and they have a good time. He now feels conflicted because he's developing stronger feelings but also wants to maintain other connections without being unfaithful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been in a long-distance relationship, which typically requires mutual commitment and trust. The author hasn't been clear about his intentions from the start. He mentions not being ready to say \"I love you\" and hasn't communicated his desire to pursue others. Even if he's not cheating, pursuing other women while in a relationship can be deceitful if the partner isn't aware. The key here is transparency. If he hasn't discussed this with his current partner, he might be misleading her. The author's mindset of \"collecting experience for the future\" could be a problem if he's not honest about his intentions. The question is whether his actions are wrong because of the lack of communication or because of the pursuit itself. If he's not in a monogamous relationship and both parties are aware, then maybe not. But if he's leading her to believe they're exclusive without her consent, that's where the issue lies. Also, breaking up after making her feel secure could be hurtful. The user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. So, the answer hinges on whether the author is being deceptive or if he's being upfront. Since the scenario suggests he hasn't communicated his intentions clearly, it's possible he's in the wrong.\n"
