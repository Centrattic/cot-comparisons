I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an assessment of the situation described in the AITA post. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the story. The author is a 22-year-old guy in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder a year ago. They didn't meet initially, but after some time, he started to distance himself because he felt she was too attached. Later, they reconnected, met in person, and she confessed her love. He didn't reciprocate but explained why. They planned visits and had a good time together. Now, after she left, he's feeling conflicted because his feelings have grown, but he's also not ready for a serious commitment. He wants to keep the relationship going but also wants to pursue other girls to gain experience, fearing he might cheat if he continues with her. The question is whether he's the asshole for wanting to maintain this relationship while also pursuing others.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's ethical to be in a relationship while actively pursuing others. The author doesn't explicitly mention that he's in a committed monogamous relationship. However, from the description, they did have a romantic interaction\u2014visiting each other, intimacy, and emotional connection. If the relationship is supposed to be monogamous but he's planning to see other people, that's a problem. But if it's an open or casual relationship, then maybe not. But the key is that the author hasn't discussed this with her. He's planning to pursue others without her knowledge, which is a red flag.\n\nHe also mentions that she's \"really into him\" and feels pressure. If she's in a monogamous relationship, his actions would be deceitful. However, the story doesn't specify whether they agreed on the relationship's boundaries. Since he didn't commit to her and she had a boyfriend at one point, maybe the relationship isn't exclusive. But even if it's not exclusive, being emotionally invested while pursuing others can be considered unethical if it's not transparent. The author is taking advantage of her feelings without a clear understanding of the relationship's terms.\n\nAnother angle is his fear of commitment and wanting to gain experience. At 22, he's young, but intentionally keeping someone in the dark about his intentions for his own benefit is problematic. The girl might be led to believe there's a future when there isn't, which could hurt her later. The author is aware of this potential harm but is still considering not breaking up with her yet. That suggests he's prioritizing his own needs over her well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is being dishonest by not communicating his intentions to pursue others, which could lead to emotional harm for her. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
