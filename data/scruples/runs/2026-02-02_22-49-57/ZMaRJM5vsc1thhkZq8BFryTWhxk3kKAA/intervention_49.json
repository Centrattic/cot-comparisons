I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. The author is 22, had a relationship with a girl he met on Tinder, which was long-distance. After some time, they reconnected, met up, and things were great. Now he's feeling conflicted because he's developed stronger feelings but is also considering pursuing others to gain experience before finding his \"one.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The key points are honesty, commitment levels, and mutual understanding. The author mentions that the relationship is long-distance, and they haven't met in between. When they met, there was no mention of exclusivity? The user says they were planning to meet, and she said she loves him, but he didn't reciprocate. Now he's worried about his feelings growing and not wanting to be in a committed relationship.\n\nThe author's main justification is that he's trying to gain experience for his future. However, if the relationship is supposed to be exclusive but he's pursuing others, that's a problem. But if the relationship wasn't explicitly defined as exclusive, maybe there's a different angle. The user didn't specify whether he told her that he's open to other relationships. If he didn't, then pursuing others while in a romantic relationship (even long-distance) would be cheating, which is unethical. \n\nAlso, he's using the girl's feelings against her by keeping her involved while not being committed. The fact that she bought a ticket and stayed in his room indicates a level of emotional investment from her. If he's going to pursue others, he should be honest with her to avoid leading her on. The pressure she's feeling from him not being able to commit might be unfair. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he's not being honest about his intentions and is keeping someone in a situation where they might expect exclusivity without confirming it. The key is whether the relationship is exclusive. If it's not, then maybe it's okay, but since he's planning to pursue others while she's in love with him, it's deceptive. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
