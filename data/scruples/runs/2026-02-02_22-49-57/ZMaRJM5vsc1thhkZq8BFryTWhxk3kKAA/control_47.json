I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a long-distance relationship. The user is a 22-year-old guy who met a girl on Tinder a year ago. They never met in person, but she got really attached to him. He started giving her the cold shoulder because he was scared she'd fall in love. Then, after ten months, she reached out again, and they started talking again. She ended up visiting him, stayed in his room, had sex, and she told him she loves him. He didn't say it back but explained why. Now, they're planning to see each other again, but he's worried that his feelings might grow too strong, leading to a breakup. He also wants to pursue other girls to gain experience before finding his future partner. The main question is whether he's in the wrong for maintaining this relationship while also looking to date others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. They've been in a long-distance relationship, even though they haven't met until recently. The key point here is whether the relationship is exclusive. The author mentions he hasn't deleted her from Snapchat, but it's not clear if they've established exclusivity. If the relationship is exclusive, then pursuing other girls would be a problem because it's a form of cheating or at least being dishonest. However, if it's non-exclusive, then maybe it's not wrong.\n\nThe author also mentions he's trying to gain experience with other girls so he doesn't \"fuck it up\" with his future partner. This suggests he's not committed to this relationship long-term, which could be an issue if the other girl believes there's a future. He's worried about hurting her if he breaks up, but he's not sure if he should end it now. There's a sense of emotional manipulation here\u2014using the relationship for experience while not wanting to hurt her. \n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact on the girl. She's clearly invested, having told him she loves him, and she's making efforts to visit him. If the author isn't emotionally committed and is planning to pursue others, he's putting her in a position where she might invest more than he's willing to reciprocate. That's unfair to her. Even if the relationship isn't exclusive, he's leading her on by maintaining the relationship and then potentially pursuing others, which could be seen as inconsiderate or deceitful.\n\nAlso, the author's fear of growing attached is a red flag. He's afraid that his feelings might deepen, which is a reason to keep her around but also a reason to eventually break up. This uncertainty can be damaging for the other person, who might not have the same reservations. \n\nIn many relationships, especially when someone is being pursued or is in a vulnerable state (like after a breakup), it's important to be honest about intentions. If the author is using this relationship to gain experience while planning to move on, that's not being transparent and can lead to emotional harm. The girl might believe there's a future together, while the author is using her as a stepping stone. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is likely in the wrong because he's misleading the girl about his intentions, not being honest about his non-monogamous plans, and potentially using her for experience without a genuine commitment. Even if the relationship isn't exclusive, the way he's handling it is manipulative and could hurt her more than a breakup would.\n"
