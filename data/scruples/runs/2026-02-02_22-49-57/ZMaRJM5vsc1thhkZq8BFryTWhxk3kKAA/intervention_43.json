I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a long-distance relationship where the guy is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the relationship. The user initially met a girl online, they had a connection, and after some time, she ended up visiting him. They had a good time, but he's now feeling conflicted because he doesn't think she's his future partner and wants to explore other relationships, but he's worried about hurting her if he breaks up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The main issue here is whether it's okay to stay in a committed relationship while also seeing other people. The author mentions that the relationship is long-distance, which can be challenging. However, if the relationship is monogamous (which it seems to be since the author didn't mention any prior agreement about exclusivity), then pursuing others without informing the partner could be considered cheating or at least unethical.\n\nThe author also says that he hasn't explicitly committed to a monogamous relationship. He started the relationship on Tinder, which is typically for dating, and they have plans to meet again. Even if there's no formal commitment, emotional attachment and physical intimacy can create an implied exclusivity. The fact that the girl expressed love and bought a train ticket suggests she might see the relationship as more serious.\n\nAnother angle is the author's intention. He's aware that pursuing others might lead to cheating, which he wants to avoid. However, he's not wanting to end the relationship because he likes her but doesn't see her as his future. The problem is that he's keeping her in the dark about his intentions. If he's not interested in a long-term commitment and is looking to date others, he should be honest with her. Otherwise, it's deceptive and could hurt her when he eventually moves on.\n\nThe author's justification is that he wants to gain experience before finding a future partner. While that might be his reasoning, it's not an excuse to mislead someone else. Relationships, even casual ones, require honesty and mutual understanding. If the author isn't willing to be monogamous or commit to a future with her, he should either be upfront about that or not start a relationship in the first place.\n\nMoreover, the author is planning to meet her again soon, which could lead to more emotional investment from her. If he continues to engage with her while seeing others, it's a form of emotional cheating. The key here is whether both parties are on the same page regarding the relationship's boundaries. Since there's no indication that she's aware of his intentions to pursue others, he's not being honest, which is a problem.\n\nIn summary, the author is not being truthful with the girl about his intentions and is planning to pursue other relationships while keeping her. This creates a situation where he's using her for companionship without considering her feelings or the potential harm. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
