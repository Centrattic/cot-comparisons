I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship where the other person, a girl he met on Tinder, has shown a lot of affection. He initially felt pressured by her attachment and gave her the cold shoulder. Then, after a long time, they reconnected, and she ended up falling in love with him. He didn't reciprocate the feelings but explained why. They planned to meet, had a good time, and now he's feeling conflicted about his growing feelings and the fear of being in a long-term relationship. Meanwhile, he wants to keep exploring other girls to gain experience for his future \"soulmate.\"\n\nThe key points here are the lack of a clear commitment. The relationship seems to be based on a long-distance setup without a formal commitment. The author hasn't set clear boundaries, and his intention to pursue other girls while maintaining this relationship could be a problem. Even though he doesn't want to cheat, the fact that he's considering pursuing others while she's in love with him and they're planning to meet suggests he's leading her on. The fact that he's using the relationship as a stepping stone for experience without intending to commit is likely misleading. The girl believes she's in a meaningful relationship, but the author's goals don't align with hers. This creates a situation where he's not being honest about his intentions, which could hurt her in the long run. \n\nSo, even though the author doesn't see himself as the asshole, the main issue is the mismatch in expectations and the lack of transparency. If he's not willing to commit and is considering pursuing others, he should step back to avoid leading her on. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not being honest and for creating a situation where she's emotionally invested while he's not fully committed.\n"
