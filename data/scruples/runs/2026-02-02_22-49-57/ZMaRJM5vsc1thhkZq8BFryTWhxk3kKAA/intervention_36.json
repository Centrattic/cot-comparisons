I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: The author and the girl started a LDR after reconnecting after some time. They had a visit, shared intimate moments, and the author is now feeling conflicted because he's grown feelings but also doesn't see her as his future partner. He wants to gain experience with other girls before settling down, which creates a dilemma between honesty and potentially hurting her.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the author is being deceptive. In a relationship, even a long-distance one, there's an expectation of exclusivity. If the author isn't upfront about his intentions to pursue others, he's violating that trust. The girl might believe the relationship is exclusive, and if he starts seeing others without her knowledge, that's cheating. The author mentions he doesn't want to break up with her now because it would hurt her, but he's also considering pursuing others. That's a red flag because he's not transparent about his intentions. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to gain experience for his future. But that's a personal justification, not a valid ethical defense. Relationships require mutual understanding and consent. If the girl isn't aware that he's open to pursuing others, then he's not being honest. Even if he hasn't cheated yet, his intention to do so while keeping the relationship going is problematic. The pressure he feels is his own issue, but it doesn't justify dishonesty. \n\nHe should have had a conversation with her about his feelings and future plans. If she's content with the current setup and they're both okay with non-exclusivity, that's different. But he hasn't mentioned discussing this. Without that, his actions could be seen as manipulative or emotionally exploitative. So yes, the author is in the wrong for not being upfront and for planning to pursue others while in a committed LDR.\n"
