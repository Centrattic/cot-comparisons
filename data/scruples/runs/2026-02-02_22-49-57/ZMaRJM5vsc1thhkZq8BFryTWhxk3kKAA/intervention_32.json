I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and also pursuing other girls. Let me break down the story.\n\nThe author met a girl online, they had a long-distance relationship. He was initially scared of her attachment and gave her the cold shoulder. Then they reconnected, she bought a train ticket to visit him, stayed in his room, had sex, and he's now feeling conflicted because his feelings have grown but he's worried about not being able to commit long-term. He also mentions his mindset of wanting to gain experience with other girls before finding his \"one,\" but doesn't want to cheat. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to keep her while pursuing others.\n\nHmm. First, the key points are: the author is in a relationship (they planned a visit, had intimate moments), and he's considering pursuing others while in that relationship. Even if he's not cheating yet, the intention to pursue others while committed to someone else is a problem. The girl is into him and has feelings; he's not reciprocating the same level of commitment. He's using the excuse that he wants to gain experience for the future, but by being in a relationship and not being honest about his intentions, he's leading her on. \n\nAlso, he didn't break up with her before starting to see other girls. In many relationships, exclusivity is expected, even in long-distance. If he's not willing to be exclusive, that's a breach of trust. Even if he's not cheating, pursuing others while in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it's deceitful and can hurt the partner. The author is creating emotional dependency without being able to commit, which is hurtful. So I think the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
