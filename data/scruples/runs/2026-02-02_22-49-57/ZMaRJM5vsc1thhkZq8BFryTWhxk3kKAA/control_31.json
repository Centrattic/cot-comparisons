I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the guy is maintaining it but also pursuing other girls. He's conflicted because he doesn't want to hurt the girl he's in a relationship with, but he's worried about his feelings growing too much and not wanting to commit long-term.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points. The guy started a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. She became very attached, which made him uncomfortable. He then pushed her away but later reconnected. They met up, had a good time, and she told him she loves him. He didn't reciprocate but said he couldn't say it back. Now, after being together, he's conflicted because his feelings have grown, but he also wants to pursue others to gain experience for his future partner. He's worried about cheating if he keeps the relationship going.\n\nThe main issue here is whether it's ethical to be in a committed relationship while pursuing others. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for doing so. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not).\n\nIn most relationships, even if they're not official or long-term, being exclusive is usually expected. If the guy is in a relationship with this girl, even if it's just a casual one, pursuing other girls would be considered a breach of trust. The fact that they met up and had intimate moments might imply a level of exclusivity. The guy's justification is that he's trying to gain experience for his future partner, but that doesn't negate the fact that he's leading the current partner on. He also mentions he doesn't want to break up with her now because it would hurt her, but he's not honest about his intentions of pursuing others. That's deceitful.\n\nThe girl has invested a lot emotionally\u2014she's in love, bought a train ticket to visit him. He's using her for experience without considering her feelings. Even if he doesn't see her as a future partner, he should be honest and not keep her in a situation where she's emotionally invested while he's looking elsewhere. The fact that he's planning to pursue others while maintaining this relationship shows a lack of commitment and respect for her feelings. He's creating a scenario where she's likely to get hurt eventually.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not being honest and is emotionally manipulating the girl by keeping her on a pedestal while he explores other options. He should either commit to the relationship as it is or be honest about his intentions and end it to avoid leading her on. So the answer is A.\n"
