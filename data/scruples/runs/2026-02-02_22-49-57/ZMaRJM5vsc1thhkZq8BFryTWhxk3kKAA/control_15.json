I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They didn't meet for a while, then reconnected, met up, and had a good time. Now he's feeling conflicted because his feelings have grown, but he's also thinking about pursuing other girls to gain experience for his \"future soulmate.\" He doesn't want to cheat, but he's worried he might if he keeps the relationship going.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. It started as a long-distance, maybe not even officially defined at first. Then they met up and had a romantic experience. The key here is whether there's a mutual understanding about exclusivity. The user mentions she said she loves him, but he didn't reciprocate. However, they were planning meetups and had a physical relationship. If the relationship is supposed to be exclusive, then pursuing others would be a problem. But if it's more open or casual, maybe not. But the user hasn't clarified that with her.\n\nAnother point is the initial hesitation. The user was afraid of her getting too attached, so he gave her the cold shoulder. That could have set a precedent of mixed signals. Now, after reconnecting and spending time together, he's unsure about his commitment. If he's not ready to commit fully, but is keeping her in the relationship while looking for others, that's where the issue lies. It's about honesty and respecting her feelings. She might believe they're in a committed relationship, so if he's planning to pursue others without her knowing, that's deceitful.\n\nAlso, the user's reasoning about gaining experience for a future relationship could be a way to justify his actions. But if he's in a relationship with her, even if it's not the \"one,\" he should be truthful about his intentions. If he's not ready to commit and is using her for emotional or physical connection while planning to see others, that's not fair to her. She's emotionally invested, as she expressed love, and he's keeping her on a string without clear communication.\n\nThe user also mentions not wanting to break up with her because it might hurt her. But keeping her in a situation where he's not fully committed and is pursuing others is also hurtful. It's important to communicate his intentions to avoid leading her on. If he can't commit and isn't honest about seeing others, he's being inconsiderate of her feelings and potentially manipulating the situation for his own benefit.\n\nIn conclusion, if the relationship is supposed to be exclusive and the user is planning to pursue others without her knowledge, then he's in the wrong. The key factors are the lack of communication about exclusivity and the user's intention to engage with other people while in a romantic relationship. That's deceitful and shows a lack of respect for her feelings.\n"
