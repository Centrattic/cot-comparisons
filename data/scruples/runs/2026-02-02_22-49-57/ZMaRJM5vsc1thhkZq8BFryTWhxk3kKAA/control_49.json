I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The author is in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met online, and he's also considering pursuing other girls. The key points here are his intentions and the dynamics of the relationship.\n\nFirst, he initially met her on Tinder, and she became very attached. He backed off because he felt scared. Then, after some time, they reconnect, she confesses her love, but he doesn't reciprocate. They have a three-day meet-up, and he's now worried about growing feelings but also his desire to explore other relationships. The main issue is whether he's being deceptive or manipulative by staying in the relationship while intending to pursue others.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, honesty is crucial. If the author isn't transparent about his intentions to pursue others, that's a problem. He's keeping her in the relationship without disclosing that he's not fully committed, which could be seen as emotionally manipulative. Even if he doesn't want to hurt her, the fact that he's planning to pursue other people while maintaining this relationship suggests he's not being truthful or respectful of her feelings.\n\nAlso, the fact that he hasn't broken up with her despite knowing his feelings might grow more complicated in the future indicates a lack of commitment. He's using her for emotional and physical connection while holding back, which isn't fair. The line between casual dating and a committed relationship is blurred here. If he's not willing to be exclusive, he should be honest about that from the start. \n\nMoreover, his reasoning that he wants to gain experience for a future \"soulmate\" doesn't excuse his behavior. It's a common excuse, but it's still disingenuous. Everyone has the right to know where they stand in a relationship. By not being upfront, he's putting her in a position where she might invest more emotionally than he's willing to give, which is unfair.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's being dishonest about his intentions and isn't treating the relationship with the respect it deserves. The answer should be A.\n"
