I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a long-distance relationship where the guy is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the current one. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The guy met a girl online, had a connection, but became scared of her attachment. He gave her the cold shoulder, then after some time, reconnected and she bought a ticket to visit him. They had a good time, she loves him, but he's not ready to reciprocate. Now, he's feeling conflicted because he still enjoys her company but is worried about his growing feelings and the possibility of cheating if he continues to pursue others.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to keep this relationship while also seeing other girls. The key here is the definition of the relationship. If it's implied to be monogamous, then pursuing others would be a breach of trust. However, if it's an open or non-monogamous arrangement, then it's different. The problem is that the author hasn't communicated his intentions clearly. He's keeping her in the dark about his plans to pursue others, which can be deceitful.\n\nThe girl has invested a lot of emotion, even bought a ticket to visit him, and he hasn't set boundaries. His actions might lead her to believe they're in a committed relationship when he's not. Even if he doesn't cheat, the lack of honesty about his intentions could be harmful. The author is using her for experience while avoiding commitment, which isn't fair. The fact that he's planning to meet others without her knowledge suggests a lack of respect for her feelings. So, yes, he's in the wrong because he's not being transparent and is leading her on without mutual understanding.\n"
