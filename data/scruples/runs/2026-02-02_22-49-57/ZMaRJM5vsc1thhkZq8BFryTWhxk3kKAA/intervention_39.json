I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and pursuing other girls. The author is 22, and the situation involves a girl he met on Tinder. They started a long-distance relationship, met up, had a good time, and now he's conflicted because he's not sure if she's the right long-term partner. He wants to gain experience with other girls before finding his \"one,\" but he doesn't want to cheat or hurt her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of their relationship. If it's a committed monogamous relationship, then pursuing others would be a problem. But the user says they haven't officially labeled the relationship as exclusive. The author mentions she's affectionate and he wasn't sure about his feelings initially. Also, he didn't reciprocate her love at first but later didn't break up, so maybe they're in a casual or emotionally intimate but not exclusive setup.\n\nHe's worried about breaking her heart if he ends it, but he's also unsure about the future. His intention is to gain experience for his future relationship, which suggests he's not looking for a serious commitment right now. However, if he's leading her on by maintaining the relationship without being upfront about his intentions, that could be an issue. He might be emotionally invested while also planning to pursue others, which could be manipulative or inconsiderate.\n\nBut the key here is consent and honesty. If he hasn't made it clear that the relationship isn't exclusive, then he's in the wrong. However, if he and she both understand that it's not a committed relationship and are okay with some level of freedom, then it's different. The author doesn't mention discussing boundaries, though. So, he might not have been honest about his intentions, leading her to believe there's more potential than there is. That would make him the asshole for not being upfront and potentially stringing her along.\n\nOn the other hand, if the relationship is casual and both parties are aware of that, then it's not his fault. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, it depends on the context. The user's own judgment says the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the information given. The author hasn't explicitly stated that the relationship is non-exclusive, so he could be misleading her. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not being honest about his intentions and planning to pursue others while she's emotionally attached. That could hurt her in the long run, especially if she expects more commitment.\n"
