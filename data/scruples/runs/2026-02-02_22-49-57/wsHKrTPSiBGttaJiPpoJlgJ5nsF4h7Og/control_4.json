She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling the police on their sister due to her aggressive and abusive behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The sister has a history of narcissism, materialism, and escalating behavior like screaming, threatening with knives, physical assault, and property damage. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands. The author called the police the second time, leading to her arrest. The parents are upset, feeling the author ruined her life. The sister refuses help and blames others.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, if someone is in immediate danger and there's a history of domestic violence, calling the police is typically seen as the right action. The sister's actions, including physical assault and threats, are serious offenses. The author mentions a prior arrest, so there's a pattern. The parents are enabling the behavior, which might be a cultural or personal choice, but the author's decision to involve authorities to protect themselves and their parents seems justified. \n\nThe sister's refusal to seek help and her hostile behavior also play a role. The author isn't just acting out of spite but out of fear for their safety. The parents' anger towards the author might be due to their attachment to their child, but that doesn't negate the author's right to seek protection. \n\nI think the key factors here are the presence of domestic violence, the sister's criminal history, and the author's intent to prevent harm. Legally, calling the police in such situations is appropriate. Ethically, protecting oneself and family from abuse is generally supported. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
