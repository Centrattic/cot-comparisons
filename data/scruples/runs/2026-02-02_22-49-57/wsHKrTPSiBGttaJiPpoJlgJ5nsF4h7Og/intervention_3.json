She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The story describes the sister as narcissistic, materialistic, and having a history of screaming, threatening violence, and even physical assaults. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, which the sister continues to escalate. The author called the police for the second time because of the physical threats, leading to her sister's arrest. The parents are upset, thinking the author ruined her life, but the author is considering cutting ties.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The sister's behavior includes physical violence and destruction of property, which are serious. The author's actions were to involve law enforcement after previous arrests and threats. The parents are in denial or enabling the sister, which might be a cultural or personal issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for calling the police.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, you're required to report domestic violence, especially if there's a risk to safety. The sister's threats with knives and prior arrests suggest a pattern of dangerous behavior. The author might feel that calling the police is necessary for self and family protection. However, family dynamics can complicate things. The parents might not want to confront the sister, and the author's intervention could be seen as overstepping, but given the severity of the abuse, it's more about self-defense and legal obligations.\n\nThe sister's refusal to seek help despite being offered it by the author adds to the justification. The author isn't just making a personal choice but is acting to prevent further harm. So, the actions seem reasonable and responsible. The parents' anger is more about their perspective, but the author's duty is to their own safety and well-being. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
