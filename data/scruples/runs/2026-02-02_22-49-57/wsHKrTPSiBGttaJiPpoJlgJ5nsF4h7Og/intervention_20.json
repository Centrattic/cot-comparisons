She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and materialistic tendencies that have worsened after returning from university. She yells, threatens, and even physically assaults her parents. The parents keep giving in, but the author, fearing for their safety, called the police a second time. The sister was already arrested once before for domestic violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the sister is physically assaulting family members and threatening with weapons, then calling the police is a legitimate action to protect oneself and others. Domestic violence is a serious crime, and reporting it is a right, not a wrong. The previous arrest indicates this isn't the first incident, so there's a pattern. \n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The parents are working class, funded her education, and now can't say no. The author worked hard to avoid debt, which might be a red flag for the parents enabling her behavior. The sister's refusal to seek help despite the issues could mean she's in denial or not taking responsibility. \n\nThe author's motivation: self-protection and concern for parents. They might feel it's the only way to stop the abuse when other methods failed. The parents being angry is a result of their own inaction, not the author's overstepping. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have tried other ways first, but if the sister is violent and unresponsive to counseling, legal action is necessary. Also, the sister's prior offense suggests the behavior is criminal, so the author isn't exaggerating. \n\nSo, the answer leans towards B (No) because taking legal action against domestic violence is justified, especially when there's a threat to safety and prior incidents. The parents' anger might stem from their investment in the sister, but the author isn't in the wrong for seeking protection.\n"
