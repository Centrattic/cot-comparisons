She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a sister with narcissistic and materialistic tendencies that have gotten worse after returning from university. She yells a lot, hits the parents, and threatened with knives. The author called the police twice, leading to her arrest for domestic violence. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined her sister's life. The author is considering cutting her out of their lives.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The sister's behavior includes physical assault and property destruction, which are serious. The author acted out of fear for their safety and their parents' well-being. The sister has a history of domestic violence, which is a criminal offense. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, which might be why the author took matters into their own hands.\n\nCalling the police in a domestic violence situation is generally the correct action because it's a crime and law enforcement should be involved. The sister's refusal to seek help despite being abusive is a red flag. The author's parents are upset, but their primary responsibility is to ensure the safety of their family. The author's own educational achievements and efforts to avoid debt might add context to their frustration, but the main issue is the sister's abusive actions.\n\nPossible counterarguments could be that the author could have handled it differently, like seeking therapy or intervention first. However, the sister already declined professional help each time, so the author might have felt those options were exhausted. Repeated arrests suggest that the sister isn't changing, so the author's actions might be necessary for their safety.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standpoint, reporting domestic violence is not only right but encouraged. The author can't be held responsible for someone else's criminal behavior. The parents' anger might stem from cultural or personal beliefs about family, but the author's safety and their parents' safety are paramount.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They took appropriate steps to address a serious issue that endangered the family's safety.\n"
