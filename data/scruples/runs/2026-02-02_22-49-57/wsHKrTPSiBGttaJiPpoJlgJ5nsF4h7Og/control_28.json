She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their sister who's acting really badly. She's narcissistic, materialistic, yells a lot, and even physically attacks their parents and threatens with knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her tantrums, and the author called the police on her twice, leading to her arrest for domestic violence. Now the parents are angry at the author for ruining her life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister's behavior includes screaming, yelling, physical assault, and destroying property. The author mentions that she was arrested once before for domestic violence and this is the second offense. The family is working class, and the author worked hard to get a full ride to college, so there's financial stress. The sister is refusing help, like professional treatment, and the author is frustrated to the point of calling the police again.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about the legal and ethical aspects. If the sister is committing domestic violence, including threatening with knives and actually hitting the parents, then the author is within their rights to call the police. The police are there to protect people from domestic abuse. The author's action might be seen as a necessary step to ensure safety, especially since the sister has a history of violence.\n\nBut the parents are upset because they think the author ruined her life. Maybe they feel the sister is their child and they should handle it within the family. However, repeated domestic violence is a serious issue. The author's priority is their own and their parents' safety. In such cases, involving law enforcement is often advised to prevent further abuse. \n\nAlso, the sister's refusal to seek help complicates things. The author and parents tried to get her treatment, but she refused. So, the author isn't the one causing the problem; they're trying to address a dangerous situation. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author could have tried other methods first, like legal intervention through a restraining order or involving social services, but given the sister's history, calling the police seems like a direct response to an imminent threat. The author mentions fearing for their well-being, which is a valid concern. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is trying to protect their family from abuse. The parents' enablement by giving in to the sister's demands might be part of the issue, but that's their choice. The author isn't responsible for their parents' decisions. \n\nSo, the author is acting to stop abuse and protect themselves and their parents. Therefore, the answer is B (Not the asshole).\n"
