She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation described is pretty intense. The sister has a history of aggressive behavior, including yelling, physical assault, and destroying property. She's been arrested once before for domestic violence. The author mentions that their parents are working class, worked hard to fund the sister's education, and that the sister's behavior is creating a dangerous environment. The author called the police again because they feared for their safety and their parents' well-being.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone is in immediate danger or there's a history of domestic violence, calling the police is typically the right thing to do. The sister has a prior arrest, which suggests there's already a documented history. The author's actions to protect themselves and their family might be justified legally.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The parents are enabling the sister by giving in to her demands, which might be contributing to the problem. The author's frustration with the parents' inaction could be a factor. But the author's responsibility here is to their own safety and their parents' safety. \n\nEmotionally, the parents are upset because they feel the author ruined their sister's life. But from the author's perspective, they're trying to prevent further harm. The key here is whether the author had a reasonable belief that there was a threat. Since there were prior incidents and threats involving knives, the author's decision to involve law enforcement seems reasonable.\n\nI should also consider if there were other options. The author tried getting the sister to seek help, but she refused. So, the author might have felt that legal intervention was the only remaining option. In such cases, calling the police is a responsible action to ensure safety.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say the author should have handled it differently, like more family therapy or legal measures other than police. But given the sister's history and the direct threats, calling the police is a standard response to prevent further danger. The author isn't fabricating issues; they're responding to real, documented behavior.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is acting to protect themselves and their family from a dangerous situation. The sister's actions are the main issue here. The author's actions are justified under the circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
