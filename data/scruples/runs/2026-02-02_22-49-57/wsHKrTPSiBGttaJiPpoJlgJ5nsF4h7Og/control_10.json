She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author calling the police on their sister because she's being physically violent and causing a lot of stress. The sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with a history of screaming and even hitting their parents. The author mentions that the sister has threatened to attack them with knives, so they removed knives from the house for safety. The sister was already arrested once for domestic violence, and this is the second time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main concern is safety. If the sister is physically assaulting family members and threatening to use knives, that's a serious issue. The parents aren't standing up to her, which is probably adding to the problem. The author called the police to protect themselves and their parents. Legally, if someone is in danger or witnessing abuse, reporting it is a responsible action. \n\nBut then, the parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life. There's a cultural or familial expectation here maybe. In some cultures, there's a strong emphasis on family unity and not involving authorities, even in abusive situations. The author might be seen as betraying their sister. However, the sister's actions are criminal and dangerous, so the parents' anger might be more about protecting their child rather than the rightness of the action. \n\nThe sister has refused help, which means the family has tried to resolve it internally without success. The author is acting out of fear and a desire to stop the abuse. The law is supposed to protect people in such cases. If the author didn't call the police, they might be enabling the abuse. \n\nOn the other hand, could the author have done something else first? Maybe tried to get more legal protections, like a restraining order, or involved other authorities before the second call. But given the sister's prior arrest and the escalating threats, the author's action seems justified. The parents' reaction might be a result of denial or a desire to protect their daughter regardless of the danger. \n\nSo, the author's intent was to protect themselves and their family, which is a good motive. The sister's actions are criminal, so contacting the police is appropriate. The parents' anger is a consequence of the situation but doesn't make the author wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
