She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a sister who's being abusive and the author called the police on her. The sister has a history of violent behavior, including threatening with knives and hitting parents. The parents are enabling her, and the author felt they couldn't handle it anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to check the facts. The sister is 21, so an adult. She's been abusive, both emotionally and physically. The author called the police for domestic violence, which is a second offense. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life. \n\nThe key points here are the sister's actions. If she's been physically violent, threatening with weapons, and the author has a valid fear for their safety, then calling the police seems like a reasonable step. The author also mentions they've tried to get her help before, but she refused. \n\nIn many places, adults can be reported for domestic violence, even if they're family members. The author isn't the one being violent; they're the victim. The parents' reaction is based on their feelings about their daughter, but the author's priority is safety. \n\nSo, the author acted to protect themselves and their parents from an abusive situation. Unless there's some reason to doubt the sister's behavior (like false accusations), the author isn't in the wrong. The parents might be upset, but the law is there to help in such cases. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
