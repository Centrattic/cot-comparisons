She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation involves a 21-year-old sister who's been acting out since returning from university. She's narcissistic, materialistic, yells a lot, and even physically assaults her parents and threatens with knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the author is frustrated because they worked hard to avoid burdening their family with debt.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the sister's behavior. Physical assault and property destruction are serious issues. The police were called twice, with the first arrest for domestic violence. The author mentions fearing for their safety and the parents' well-being. Legally, if someone is a threat to others or commits violent acts, calling the police is justified. Domestic violence is a criminal matter, so the author might be right to involve authorities to protect the family.\n\nThe parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life. But their inaction allowed the sister to continue harmful behavior. The sister's refusal to seek help despite the impact on the family could mean she's not taking responsibility. The author's motivation is self-protection and their parents', which is a valid reason. \n\nIs there any reason to think the author overreacted? Maybe if the calls were unnecessary or if there were other solutions. But given the sister's history and the threats, the author's actions seem reasonable. The key points are the physical violence, repeated offenses, and the family's inability to set boundaries. The author isn't trying to harm the sister but to ensure safety. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
