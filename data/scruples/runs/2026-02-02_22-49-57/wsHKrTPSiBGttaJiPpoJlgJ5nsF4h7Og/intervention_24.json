She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves a 21-year-old sister with narcissistic and materialistic tendencies that have worsened after studying abroad. She screams, throws tantrums, physically assaults parents, and threatens with knives. The parents gave her a full ride, while the author worked hard for a full ride to avoid debt. The sister was already arrested once for domestic violence and this is the second time. The author called the police again, leading to her arrest, and now the parents are upset because they think the author ruined her life.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key elements. The sister's behavior includes physical assault and destruction of property, which are criminal acts. The author acted to protect themselves and their parents, which is a legitimate reason to involve law enforcement. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, which perpetuates the cycle of abuse. The sister has refused help, so the author's actions might be necessary for safety.\n\nBut wait, the parents are angry at the author for calling the police. That's a complicating factor. Maybe they feel betrayed or don't want to take action against their child. However, the author's primary responsibility is their own safety and their parents' well-being. In cases of domestic violence, especially with prior offenses, calling the police is appropriate. The sister's behavior is clearly harmful and potentially dangerous.\n\nThe question is about moral judgment. The author is trying to stop abuse, which is right. The parents might not see it that way, but the sister's actions are wrong. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They took action to protect themselves and their family from harm, even if it caused family tension. It's a tough situation, but the author's intentions were protective, which justifies their actions.\n"
