She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation is pretty intense: the sister has a history of narcissism, materialism, screaming, and even physical violence. The parents are enabling her, and the author is worried about their safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone is being physically assaulted or there's a threat of violence, calling the police is a reasonable step. The sister has a prior arrest for domestic violence, so this is a second offense. The author mentions threats with knives and property destruction. In many places, you can call the police to protect yourself or others from imminent harm. So legally, the author might be justified.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life. But the parents also enabled the sister's behavior by giving in to her demands. The author tried to get her sister help, which she refused. The sister's actions are abusive, so the author is trying to protect the family from further harm. \n\nEmotionally, the author is stressed out, living in fear, and can't even use their room without being yelled at. The sister's behavior is escalating, and the author's actions were to prevent more violence. The police were called because the situation was dangerous. \n\nIs there a chance the author overreacted? Maybe they could have tried another intervention first, but given the sister's history and the prior arrest, it seems like this was a necessary step to ensure safety. The parents might not have taken it seriously otherwise. The author is acting in self-defense and to protect their parents from the violent sister. \n\nSo considering all factors: the legal justification, the history of violence, the refusal of help, and the immediate threat, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
