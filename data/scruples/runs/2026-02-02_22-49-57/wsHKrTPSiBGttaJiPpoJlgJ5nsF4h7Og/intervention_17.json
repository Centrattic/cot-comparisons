She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person called the police on their sister twice for domestic violence, including physical assault and threats. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, throwing tantrums, and now even threatening with knives. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life.\n\nFirst, the author's actions are about protecting themselves and their parents. The sister's behavior is escalating to physical violence and property destruction. The police were called because there's a genuine fear for safety. The previous arrest was for domestic violence, and the second incident is another offense. The parents are in a working-class situation, which adds stress but doesn't justify the sister's actions.\n\nThe parents are enabling the sister by giving in to her tantrums. The author tried to get help for the sister, but she refused. The author's decision to involve the police seems like a last resort after other methods failed. Legal consequences for domestic violence are appropriate here since it's a crime. The parents' anger might stem from cultural or personal beliefs, but the author's responsibility is to their own safety. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for protecting their family. The sister's actions are criminal, and the author acted within the law to address it. The answer should be B.\n"
