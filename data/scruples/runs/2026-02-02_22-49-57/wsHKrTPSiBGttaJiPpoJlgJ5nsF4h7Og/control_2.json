She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote an \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author calling the police on their sister for the second time due to her abusive behavior. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points from the description. The sister is 21, returned from university in Australia, and her behavior has worsened. She yells a lot, is narcissistic and materialistic, and even physically assaults her parents and the author. The parents are working class, funded her education, and now they cave in when she throws tantrums. The author got a full ride to college, so maybe they feel the sister is being spoiled. The sister has been arrested once before for domestic violence, and the author called the police again, leading to the second arrest. Now the parents are angry at the author for ruining the sister's life.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the sister's actions first. Physical assault and destruction of property are serious issues. The sister has a history of domestic violence, which the author is trying to report. The parents are not addressing it, which adds to the problem. The author is acting out of concern for their safety and their parents' well-being. \n\nBut does the author have the right to call the police repeatedly? In most cases, domestic violence is a criminal matter, and reporting it is a responsible action. The sister's threats with knives are alarming, so the author's fear is valid. The parents might feel protective, but enabling abusive behavior by caving in every time isn't healthy. \n\nThe sister's refusal to seek help is another factor. If she's not willing to address her issues, then the author's intervention through legal means might be justified. \n\nHowever, the parents' reaction is that the author ruined her life. Maybe they feel that the sister is their child and they want to protect her, even from her own actions. But the author is prioritizing safety over family harmony, which is a tough situation. \n\nIn terms of legal perspective, if the sister is committing crimes, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting them. The sister's actions are what's wrong here. So the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking necessary steps to protect themselves and their family from abuse.\n"
