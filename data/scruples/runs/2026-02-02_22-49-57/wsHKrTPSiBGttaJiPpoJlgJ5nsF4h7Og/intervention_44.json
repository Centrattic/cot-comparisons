She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, and her behavior has gotten worse after returning from university. She yells a lot, throws tantrums, and even physically assaults her parents and destroys property. The family is working class, and the parents funded her lavish lifestyle, which the author worked hard to avoid by getting a full ride. The sister was previously arrested for domestic violence and this is her second offense. The author called the police again because they feared for their safety and the parents' well-being. Now the parents are angry, thinking the author ruined her sister's life.\n\nI need to consider the legal and moral aspects. Physically assaulting family members is domestic violence, which is a crime. If the sister has a history of this, then reporting her might be necessary to ensure safety. The parents might be in denial or not taking the situation seriously due to financial strain. The author's action could be seen as protecting their family, which is a valid reason. But maybe the parents felt betrayed? However, the sister's actions are clearly abusive. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author is taking a stand against abuse. The sister is the one committing crimes, so the author isn't the asshole. They have a right to seek help from authorities when there's a threat. Even though the parents are upset, the author isn't responsible for their sister's behavior. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
