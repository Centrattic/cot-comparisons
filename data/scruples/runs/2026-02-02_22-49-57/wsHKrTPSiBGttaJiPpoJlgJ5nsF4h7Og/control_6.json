She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling the police on their sister for abusive behavior. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The sister is 21, recently returned from university, and has a history of narcissism, materialism, and escalating behavior. The sister yells a lot, is physically abusive towards the parents, and has threatened them with knives. The author mentions that the sister was previously arrested for domestic violence and this is her second offense. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life.\n\nThe key points here are about abuse and safety. The sister is being physically violent, destroying property, and making threats. The author acted to involve the police to protect their family. In many places, domestic violence is a serious offense, and calling the police in such cases is a responsible action. The parents might be in denial or in a codependent situation, but the author's priority is their safety and their parents' safety.\n\nThe sister has refused help, which makes the situation worse. The author's actions were likely justified to prevent further harm. The parents' reaction is understandable but doesn't absolve the sister's behavior. The question is whether the author is wrong for calling the police. Since the sister's actions are criminal, the author is within their rights to report it. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
