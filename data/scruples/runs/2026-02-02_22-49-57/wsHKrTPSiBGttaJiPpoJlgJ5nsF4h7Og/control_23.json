She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about calling the police on their sister due to her abusive and violent behavior. The sister is described as narcissistic, materialistic, and having a history of screaming, physical assaults, and threatening with knives. The parents won't stand up to her, and the author felt they had to act to protect themselves and their parents. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone is in immediate danger and there's a history of violence, calling the police is a reasonable action. The author mentions the sister was already arrested once before for domestic violence. This time could be a second offense, so the police would likely respond appropriately. The author wasn't just calling over a disagreement but due to threats and actual violence.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life. But the parents also enabled the sister by giving in to her tantrums. The author might feel that they had no choice left after exhausting other options like suggesting therapy, which the sister refused. The author's own well-being and safety are at stake here. \n\nIs there any fault on the author's part? They didn't provoke the sister, and their action was to seek help for a dangerous situation. Maybe the parents' anger is misplaced because they didn't address the problem earlier. The key points are the history of violence, the sister's refusal to seek help, and the author's fear for their safety. So, no, the author isn't in the wrong here. They took a necessary step to protect themselves and their family.\n"
