She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author called the police on their sister for domestic violence, including physical assault and threats with knives. The sister has a history of this, and the parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The sister has a history of violent behavior, including hitting parents and threatening with knives. The author called the police twice, leading to an arrest. The parents are working class, and the sister was already funded by them for university. The author worked hard to get a full ride to college, so there's a contrast in their situations. The sister refuses help, and the family has had to remove knives from the home due to threats.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's actions are clearly abusive and violent. Calling the police in cases of domestic violence is generally seen as a responsible action to ensure safety. The author mentions fearing for their own and their parents' well-being, which is a valid reason to involve authorities. The sister's refusal to seek help and the repeated offenses make the situation more serious.\n\nHowever, family dynamics can be complex. The parents' anger suggests they might see the sister as the victim, perhaps due to cultural or emotional reasons. But from a legal and safety standpoint, reporting violence is the right thing. The author isn't the one committing violence; they're trying to protect themselves and their family. So, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're acting to prevent further harm.\n"
