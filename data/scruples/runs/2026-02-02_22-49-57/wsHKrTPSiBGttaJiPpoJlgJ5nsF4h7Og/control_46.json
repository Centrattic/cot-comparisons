She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a sister who's been acting out with narcissistic and materialistic behavior, especially after coming back from university. The sister yells a lot, hits the parents, and there's even a mention of threatening to attack them with knives. The author called the police on her twice, leading to her arrest for domestic violence. The parents are upset with the author, thinking they ruined her life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality and the justification for calling the police. If the sister is physically assaulting family members and threatening them, then calling the police is a reasonable response to protect oneself and others. Domestic violence is a serious crime, and the author is within their rights to report it, especially if there's a prior arrest and ongoing threats.\n\nThe parents are unhappy because they feel the author ruined their child's life. But from the author's perspective, the sister's actions are harmful and abusive. The author mentions working hard for a full ride to college to help the parents, implying they don't want to be in debt and are trying to support the family. \n\nHowever, the parents might have different views, prioritizing family over the immediate danger. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, reporting a domestic violence incident isn't a wrong action. The author cites genuine fear for their safety and their parents' well-being, which are valid reasons. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or familial expectation they should have handled it differently? The parents might believe in giving their child more chances, but the sister's refusal to seek help and the repeated offenses suggest that the author acted to stop further harm. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions were to protect against abuse and prevent future harm. Unless there's a lack of evidence or intent to harm, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
