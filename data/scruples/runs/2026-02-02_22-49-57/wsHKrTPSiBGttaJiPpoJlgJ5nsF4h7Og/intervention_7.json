She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is the sister is being really aggressive, yelling a lot, threatening with knives, and even physically assaulting their parents. The author called the police on her twice, leading to her arrest for domestic violence. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined her life.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is their safety and their parents' well-being. The sister's behavior is dangerous, with threats and actual physical attacks. The parents are too scared to stand up to her, so the author took action to get her arrested. The sister has a history of this, having been arrested before for domestic violence. The author worked hard to get a full ride to college to help the family's finances, while the sister's behavior is costing the parents a lot, especially after funding her studies abroad. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author did the right thing by calling the police. From a legal standpoint, if someone is threatening others with violence, destroying property, and has a prior criminal record, calling the police is a reasonable response. The author's actions could be seen as protecting their family from abuse. The parents might not like the consequences for their daughter, but the author's priority is safety. \n\nHowever, the parents are upset because they feel it's ruining their daughter's life. But the author might argue that the alternative is living in a dangerous environment. The sister's refusal to seek help and her continued violent behavior makes the situation more serious. \n\nI think the key points are the imminent danger and the sister's criminal history. The police were called because of threats and past abuse, which are valid reasons. The author isn't the one being violent; they're seeking legal intervention to stop ongoing abuse. So the author is probably not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
