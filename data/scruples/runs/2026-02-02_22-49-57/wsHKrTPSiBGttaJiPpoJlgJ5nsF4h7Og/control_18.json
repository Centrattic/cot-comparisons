She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author called the police on their sister, who has a history of narcissism, materialism, and escalating behavior including yelling, physical assault, and threatening with knives. The sister was already arrested before for domestic violence. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined her life. The author's reasoning is that they wanted to protect themselves and their parents from harm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's actions. If she's physically assaulting her parents and threatening with knives, that's a serious criminal behavior. Domestic violence is a crime, and calling the police in response to actual threats or harm is typically seen as a responsible action. The author mentions that they feared for their safety, which is a valid reason to involve law enforcement.\n\nThe parents are upset, but their perspective is that they don't want their child's life ruined. However, their daughter's actions are the ones causing the crisis. The author is a victim here, not the aggressor. The sister has refused help, so the author's options are limited. The parents enabling the sister by giving in to her demands might be part of the problem, but that doesn't make the author wrong for seeking help when things escalate to violence.\n\nThe key points are: the sister's criminal behavior, the author's fear for safety, and the prior arrest. Calling the police in such circumstances is a reasonable step. The author isn't the one committing crimes; they're the one trying to stop them. So, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
