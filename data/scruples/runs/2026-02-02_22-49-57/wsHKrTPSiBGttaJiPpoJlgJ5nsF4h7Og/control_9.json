She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation describes the sister being narcissistic and materialistic, with escalating behavior like screaming, physical assault, and threatening with knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her tantrums, and the author felt they had no choice but to involve the police again to protect themselves and their family.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were justified. The sister's behavior includes domestic violence, as she was previously arrested for it and this is the second offense. The author mentions fear for their well-being, which is a key point. If there's a genuine threat of violence, then calling the police is a reasonable step to ensure safety.\n\nThe parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life, but the sister's actions are harmful and potentially dangerous. The author's motivation seems to be self-preservation and protecting their parents, not causing unnecessary harm. The sister has refused help, making it harder for the family to resolve the issue through other means. \n\nIn legal terms, if someone is in immediate danger, contacting law enforcement is the right thing to do. The author isn't just making a personal choice to separate from their sister but is taking action to prevent further violence. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong here. They acted to protect themselves and their family from a dangerous situation. The parents' enabling and the sister's refusal to seek help don't make the author at fault for calling the police when there's a history of domestic violence.\n"
