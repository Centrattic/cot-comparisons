She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling the police on their sister, who has a history of violent behavior and threats. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with behavior that includes screaming, physical assault, and property destruction. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands. The author has called the police twice, leading to the sister's arrest for domestic violence. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life.\n\nNow, the main question is: is the author in the wrong for calling the police? From a legal standpoint, if the sister was actually committing crimes like assault or threatening with a weapon, then calling the police is appropriate. The author mentions fear for their safety and the parents' safety, which supports the necessity of the action. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents are upset, which might suggest family tensions, but the author's actions seem to be a last resort after failed attempts to get help (like professional help, which the sister refused). The sister has a documented history, including a previous arrest. The author's motivation here is self-protection and protecting their family, which is a valid reason. \n\nI need to check if there's any indication that the author acted recklessly or without cause. The post mentions that the sister has threatened to attack with knives, and they no longer keep knives in the house. That's a serious threat. The police were called after these incidents. So, the author's actions seem justified given the context. \n\nThe parents' reaction is more about family dynamics and possibly not wanting to confront the sister's behavior. But the author's duty to protect themselves and their family from harm takes precedence. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
