She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about calling the police on their sister because she's been abusive and destructive. The sister is described as narcissistic, materialistic, and has a history of yelling, physical assault, and even threatening with knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the author felt they had to take action to protect themselves and their family.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the facts. The sister has a documented history of domestic violence, including a prior arrest. The author called the police a second time, which led to her arrest again. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life. The key points here are the sister's abusive behavior, the threat to safety, and the author's actions to report it.\n\nLegal perspective: If someone is in danger, reporting it to the police is the right thing to do. Domestic violence is a serious crime, and not reporting it could be seen as neglect. The author mentions fearing for their safety and their parents', which are valid reasons. The sister's refusal to seek help and continued threats exacerbate the situation.\n\nFamily dynamics: The parents are enabling the sister by giving in to her tantrums. The author, on the other hand, is trying to set boundaries for their own safety. The parents' anger might stem from wanting to protect their child, but that doesn't make their enablement right. The author's responsibility is to their own well-being and that of their family.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They took action to stop a dangerous situation. They had a prior incident, so it's not the first time. The sister's actions are criminal, so reporting them isn't being an asshole. The parents' reaction is part of the problem, but the author isn't the one committing the abuse. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
