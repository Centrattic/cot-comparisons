She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling the police on their sister for violent behavior, including physical assault, destruction of property, and threats with knives. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life, but the author feels they had no choice to protect themselves and their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, which worsened after university. She yells at her siblings, hits parents, and has a prior arrest for domestic violence. The author called the police again when the sister threatened to attack with knives and was arrested. The parents are working class and have given in to her demands, leading to financial strain. The author worked hard for a full ride to college to avoid burdening the parents. The sister refuses help and medication.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. If the sister is engaging in physical assault and making threats, the author has a right to call the police to protect their safety. Domestic violence is a serious matter, and reporting it is a responsible action. The parents might feel conflicted because they want to protect their child, but the author's safety is paramount. The sister's refusal to seek help complicates things, but that doesn't justify the violent behavior. \n\nPossible counterarguments could be that the author should have tried more non-legal measures first, but given the sister's history and the threats (like with knives), legal intervention might be necessary. The parents' anger could stem from wanting to protect their daughter, but they've already let her get away with bad behavior by giving in to her. The author's actions might be seen as the only way to enforce boundaries when the parents won't.\n\nIn terms of the \"AITA\" framework, the question is whether the author is the asshole. The asshole typically acts unethically or without considering others' feelings. Here, the author is acting to protect themselves and their family from violence, which is a valid reason. The sister's actions are clearly problematic, and the author's response is a last resort after prior incidents. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
