She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, verbal abuse, and even physical assault. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the author felt they had to take action to protect themselves and their family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the sister has been arrested before for domestic violence and this is a second offense, then calling the police when there's a threat to safety is probably justified. The author mentions the sister has threatened to use knives, leading to them not keeping any knives in the house. That's a serious safety concern.\n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life. But the author's actions were to protect themselves and their parents from abuse. The sister refuses help, so the author might have felt this was the only option left. \n\nLegally, if someone is in immediate danger, calling the police is the right thing to do. The sister's behavior meets domestic violence criteria, especially with the physical assault and threats. The author isn't the one being abusive here; they're the victim. \n\nThe parents' reaction is understandable but maybe they prioritize their daughter over their child's safety. However, the author's responsibility is to their own well-being. Since the sister has a documented history, the police should have taken the report seriously. \n\nI don't see any justification for the author being in the wrong. They acted to stop abuse. So the answer should be B.\n"
