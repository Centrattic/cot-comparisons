She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with behavior getting worse after returning from university. She yells a lot, hits the parents, destroys property, and even threatened to attack them with knives. The parents are working class and funded her education, while the author worked hard for a full ride. They've tried getting her help before, but she refused. The author called the police again after a prior arrest for domestic violence.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the actions of the sister meet the criteria for domestic violence or any other crime where calling the police is justified. The sister is hitting the parents and threatening with knives, which are serious physical threats. The author mentions they no longer keep knives in the house because of her, which shows a real fear for safety. The police were called before, leading to an arrest, and this is a second offense. \n\nIn most jurisdictions, domestic violence is a criminal offense, and physical assault, especially with weapons, is a serious matter. The author's concern for their own safety and their parents' safety is valid. If there's a history of abuse and the sister is continuing the behavior, reporting it to the police is a responsible action. The parents being upset because they think it's ruining her life might be their perspective, but the author's primary responsibility is to protect themselves and their family from harm.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author's parents might have a different view, perhaps feeling that the sister isn't getting the support she needs or that the situation can be handled within the family. But when there's physical violence and threats, especially a history of it, legal intervention is necessary. The author tried to get her help before, but she refused. So, the author is taking a step to ensure safety, which is a reasonable response.\n\nThe key points are the sister's violent actions, the prior arrest, and the author's fear for their safety. The parents' anger could stem from guilt or a desire to protect their child, but that doesn't negate the seriousness of the abuse. The author isn't the asshole for acting to protect their family. The sister's behavior is the problem here. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
