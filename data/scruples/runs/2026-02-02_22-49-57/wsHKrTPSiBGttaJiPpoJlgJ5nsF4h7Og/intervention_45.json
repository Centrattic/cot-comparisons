She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and violent tendencies, including physical assault on parents and threats with knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in during tantrums. The author acted out of fear for their safety and their parents' well-being, leading to a second arrest for the sister. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined her life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. If the sister has a history of domestic violence, including assault and threats, and the author genuinely feared for their safety, calling the police is a reasonable action. The police are meant to protect individuals from threats and violence. The sister's actions, especially hitting parents and threatening with knives, are serious offenses. The author's decision to involve law enforcement to prevent further harm is justified.\n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The parents are enabling the sister by giving in, which might be due to cultural, emotional, or other reasons. But the author's responsibility is to their own safety and their parents' safety. The sister's refusal to seek help and her continued harmful behavior make the author's actions necessary. \n\nHowever, the parents are upset because they feel the author ruined their child's life. This is a valid family conflict, but the author's primary duty is self-preservation. The sister's behavior is abusive and dangerous. The question is whether the author overstepped by calling the police. Since there's a history of violence and the sister was already arrested before, the author is within their rights to report it again. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the family should handle it internally, but given the severity of the sister's actions, that's not feasible. The legal system exists to address such issues, and the author is using available resources to protect themselves and their family. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
