She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The sister has a history of narcissism, materialism, and now physical violence, including hitting the parents and threatening with knives. The author called the police again after the sister's previous arrest for domestic violence. The parents are upset, thinking the author ruined their daughter's life.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the facts. The sister's behavior is escalating and includes physical assault and threats, which are serious. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands during tantrums, which might be contributing to the problem. The author's action was to call the police, which is a legal response to protect themselves and their parents from harm. The sister has a prior arrest, so this is a repeat offense. The author mentions fear for their safety, which is a valid reason to involve authorities.\n\nBut I should consider potential angles where the author might be wrong. Maybe they should have handled it differently, like trying more family mediation before involving police? However, the sister refused help and the situation was dangerous. The parents are in denial, thinking they're ruining their daughter, but the daughter's actions are harmful. Legally, the author has a right to seek protection from violence. So the author's action seems justified. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
