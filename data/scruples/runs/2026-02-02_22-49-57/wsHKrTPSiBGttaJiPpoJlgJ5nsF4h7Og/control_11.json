She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation is pretty intense. The sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, and her behavior has gotten worse after returning from university. She yells a lot, hits the parents, and destroys property. The author mentions that the parents are working class and have been funding her sister's lavish lifestyle, while the author worked hard for a full ride. The sister was already arrested once before for domestic violence, and this is a second offense. The parents are angry because they think the author ruined her life, and the sister refuses help.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did something wrong by calling the police. The sister's actions include physical assault and destruction of property, which are criminal offenses. If the author had a genuine fear for their safety and the safety of their parents, calling the police might be the right thing to do. The sister's history of domestic violence and the previous arrest suggests a pattern of dangerous behavior. The parents' unwillingness to set boundaries and their financial sacrifices add to the tension. The sister's refusal to seek help is another point. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author could have tried more family-based solutions before involving the police. But given the severity of the sister's actions, especially the physical violence and threats with knives, it seems like the author is protecting themselves and their family. The law is meant to address such situations, so calling the police isn't necessarily wrong. The parents' anger might stem from their perception of the sister's future being ruined, but the author's priority is safety. \n\nI think the key points here are the presence of domestic violence, the sister's repeated offenses, and the author's reasonable concern for safety. The author isn't in the wrong for taking legal action to protect themselves and their parents. The parents' perspective is understandable but doesn't justify the sister's abusive behavior. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
