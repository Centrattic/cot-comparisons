She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation is pretty intense. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, screaming, threatening with knives, and even physically assaulting the parents. The parents kept enabling her by giving in to her demands. The author called the police again because they were scared for their safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's actions. If she's been physically violent, threatened with knives, and there's a previous arrest for domestic violence, that's serious. The parents not wanting to report her might be due to cultural reasons, fear, or trying to protect her, but it's letting the abuse continue. The author's main concern is safety for themselves and their parents. \n\nCalling the police in a situation where there's a threat of violence is usually a responsible action. The author mentions genuine fear for their well-being. The sister's refusal to seek help and the parents' reluctance to say no are part of the problem. The author might be seen as taking a stand against ongoing abuse, even if it's a family member. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of family dynamics. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life. Maybe there's a belief that the sister will change, or they don't want her to go to jail. However, the author's safety is paramount. \n\nI don't see any indication that the author is exaggerating the sister's behavior. The sister's threats are real, and the author acted to prevent further harm. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). They took necessary steps to protect themselves and their family from a dangerous situation. The parents' anger is a result of their own choices to enable the sister, not the author's actions. The author isn't the asshole here; they're trying to stop ongoing abuse.\n"
