She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author has a 21-year-old sister who's been acting out more since returning from university abroad. She's described as narcissistic and materialistic, with a history of screaming and tantrums. The sister yells at the author for minor things, like leaving the door open. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, even though they're working-class and struggled to fund her education. The author worked hard for a full ride to college to avoid putting their parents in debt. The key issue is that the sister physically assaults the parents and destroys property, and the author called the police twice. This time, the sister had a prior arrest for domestic violence, and the author fears for their safety. The parents are angry because they think the author ruined their sister's life. The sister refuses help, claiming the family is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did the right thing by calling the police. According to the story, the sister has a history of domestic violence, including physical assaults and threats with knives. The author mentions a previous arrest, so this is a second offense. The parents are enabling her behavior by not setting boundaries, which is leading to a dangerous environment. The author's actions are motivated by a desire to protect themselves and their parents from harm. \n\nIn terms of legal perspective, if someone is a victim of domestic violence or knows someone who is being abused, calling the police is a responsible action. The sister's behavior includes physical assault and property destruction, which are criminal acts. The author's call to the police was likely in response to imminent danger, especially considering the prior offense and the threat with knives. \n\nHowever, the parents are upset because they feel the author is ruining their sister's life. This might be a cultural or family dynamic issue where there's a reluctance to involve authorities or face legal consequences. But the author's safety and the parents' safety take precedence here. \n\nThe sister's refusal to seek help and her denial of the problem suggest that the situation isn't going to improve without external intervention. The author, in this case, might be the only one taking action to protect the family. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they called the police to stop a crime in progress (like an assault) or to prevent harm, then no. The police are meant to be called in such situations. The sister's actions are criminal, so the author is not the asshole for taking that step. The parents' anger is a result of their protective stance towards their daughter, but the author's actions were necessary for safety. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have tried other avenues first, but the sister refused help. Also, if there were no immediate danger when the call was made, but the author mentions previous threats and a history, so it's plausible that the call was justified. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
