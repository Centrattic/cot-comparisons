She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the sister's behavior is described as narcissistic and materialistic, and it's gotten worse after returning from university. She yells a lot, has temper tantrums, and even physically assaults the parents. The parents are enabling her by giving in every time. The author called the police twice, leading to an arrest, and now the parents are upset, thinking the author ruined their daughter's life.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the right thing. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nLegally, if someone is committing domestic violence, including physical assault and threatening with weapons, reporting it is the correct action. The police would take that seriously. The sister's actions are criminal, so the author was protecting their family from harm. The parents might be in denial, but the author's safety and their parents' safety are valid concerns. The sister has a history of violence and refuses help, so the author's actions were necessary to prevent further abuse.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family dynamics are complicated. The parents might feel guilty or think they can fix things. But the author had a duty to protect themselves and their loved ones. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
