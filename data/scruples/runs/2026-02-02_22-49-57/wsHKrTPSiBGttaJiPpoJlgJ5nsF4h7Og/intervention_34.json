She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation is pretty intense. The sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with a history of screaming, physical assault, and destroying property. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the author is the one who finally called the police after a second incident.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. The author mentions that the sister was previously arrested for domestic violence and this is the second offense. The sister has threatened to attack them with knives, leading the family to no longer keep knives. The author's action was to protect themselves and their parents from immediate harm. Legally, calling the police in cases of domestic violence or threats of violence is usually the right thing to do, especially if there's a history of offenses.\n\nThe parents are upset because they feel the author ruined their daughter's life. But from the author's perspective, they were protecting their family from abuse. The sister refuses help, so the author might have felt this was the only option. The sister's behavior is escalating and dangerous, so the author's intervention seems justified. The parents' inaction is part of the problem, as they keep enabling the sister's behavior.\n\nIs there any angle where the author could be in the wrong? Maybe if the call to the police was based on false information or used as a tool for control. But the post states that the sister has a history of assaults and threats, and the author feared for their safety. In that case, it's a reasonable response to seek police intervention for personal protection.\n\nSo, considering all the factors\u2014the sister's violent behavior, the history of offenses, the family's failure to set boundaries, and the author's intent to ensure safety\u2014the author is not in the wrong. The correct answer should be B.\n"
