She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling the police on their sister twice because she's being abusive\u2014yelling, threatening with knives, physically assaulting parents. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined her life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the sister is physically attacking family members and threatening violence, then calling the police is likely a reasonable response. The author mentions that the sister was already arrested once before for domestic violence. So, this is a second offense. In most places, domestic violence is a criminal offense, and reporting it is not just allowed but encouraged to protect the victims. \n\nThe parents are angry, but the author is trying to protect themselves and their parents from harm. The sister's behavior is escalating, and there's a history of abuse. The parents might feel conflicted between family loyalty and safety. However, the author has a right to self-defense and to ensure their family is safe. \n\nThe sister refusing help and being uncooperative adds to the problem. The author isn't just being mean; they're reacting to actual threats and violence. The parents' financial sacrifices and the author's hard work to avoid debt are part of the background but don't directly relate to the legal action taken. \n\nI should also consider if there's any cultural context where calling the police on family is frowned upon, but the question is about being in the wrong legally or morally. Morally, the author is acting to protect their family from abuse, which is justified. Legally, reporting a crime isn't wrong. The parents' anger is more about family dynamics than the author being in the wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
