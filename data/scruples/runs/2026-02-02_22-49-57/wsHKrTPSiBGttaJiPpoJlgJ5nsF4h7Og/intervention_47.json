She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and materialistic tendencies that have worsened after returning from university. She yells a lot, threatens with knives, has physically assaulted parents, and the author called the police a second time. The parents are upset, thinking the author ruined her life.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The sister's behavior includes physical violence and threats, which are serious. The author's action was calling the police to protect themselves and their parents. The sister has a prior arrest for domestic violence, and the author mentions fearing for their well-being. The parents are upset, but their willingness to enable the sister's behavior by giving in to her demands might be a factor.\n\nLegally, calling the police when there's a threat of violence or past incidents is justified. The author acted to prevent harm, which is a standard self-defense and protection measure. The parents' disapproval doesn't make the action wrong. The sister's refusal to seek help and her violent behavior indicate she's the one at fault here. The author's full ride to college shows they worked hard, contrasting with the sister's actions that put the family in a difficult position.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have tried more solutions before calling the police. But given the sister's history, escalating to police might be necessary. Also, the author mentions it's the second time, implying prior attempts to resolve the issue didn't work. The sister's threats with knives and actual assaults are criminal behavior, so reporting is responsible.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted to protect their family from violence, which is not wrong. The sister's actions are the main issue here. The parents' anger is more about family dynamics than legal or ethical correctness. So the answer should be B.\n"
