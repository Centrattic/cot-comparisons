She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe sister is 21, returned from university, and has a history of narcissistic and materialistic behavior. It's gotten worse since abroad. She yells a lot, is aggressive, and even physically assaults the parents. The parents cave into her demands, but the author is upset because the sister's actions are harmful. The author called the police twice, leading to an arrest for domestic violence. Now the parents are angry with the author for ruining her sister's life.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the sister's behavior: she's physically violent, threatening with knives, destroying property, and the family has to hide knives. This sounds like domestic abuse. The author's fear for their safety is valid. The sister was already arrested once, so this is a repeat offense. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her tantrums, which might not be helping.\n\nThe author called the police to protect themselves and the parents. Legally, if someone is in immediate danger or witnessing domestic violence, reporting it is the right thing to do. The sister's refusal to seek help or take medication adds to the problem. The author's actions could be seen as necessary to stop ongoing abuse.\n\nHowever, the parents are upset because they feel the author ruined their daughter's life. There might be family dynamics where the parents don't want to confront the sister, maybe due to cultural reasons or fear of losing their child. The author's decision caused a rift, but the sister's actions are dangerous.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, protecting oneself and others from harm is a priority. The author isn't the one committing violence; they're seeking help. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
