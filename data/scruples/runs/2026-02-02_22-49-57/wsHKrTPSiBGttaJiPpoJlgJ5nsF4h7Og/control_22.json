She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author calling the police on their sister for physical assaults and threatening violence. The sister has a history of bad behavior, including hitting parents and destroying property. The author mentions that the sister was already arrested once before for domestic violence and this is the second time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the sister is indeed engaging in physical assault and threatening with knives, then calling the police would be a reasonable and responsible action to ensure the safety of the family members. It's important to protect oneself and others from harm, and the law is there to prevent domestic violence.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life. But the author is arguing that they have to protect themselves and their parents from ongoing abuse. The sister has refused help, which complicates things. The parents might be in denial or prioritize their daughter's well-being over their own safety, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for taking action.\n\nThe sister's behavior is escalating. The author mentions fear for their own and their parents' well-being. If there's a documented history of abuse and threats, the police should be involved. The author isn't just making a random report; they have a legitimate reason based on past incidents.\n\nAlso, the parents' financial sacrifices for the sister's education don't justify her violent behavior. The author worked hard to avoid debt, which adds to the frustration here. The sister's materialism and narcissism, exacerbated by her time abroad, are part of the problem, but the physical violence is the critical issue here.\n\nI should also consider if there's any information that might suggest the author acted without cause. The post says they called the police a second time, indicating there was a previous valid arrest. The author's actions seem to be in response to ongoing threats and actual violence, not just petty arguments.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is taking steps to protect their family from a dangerous situation. While it's tough on family relationships, the use of legal resources to stop domestic violence is appropriate. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
