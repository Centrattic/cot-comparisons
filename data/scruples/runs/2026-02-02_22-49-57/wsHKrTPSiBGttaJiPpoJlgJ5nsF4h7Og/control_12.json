She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation sounds pretty intense. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, screaming, and even physical assault. The parents won't stand up to her, and the author had to call the police twice because of the threats and violence.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The sister is physically attacking the parents and threatening them with knives. The author mentions that this is the second time they called the police, and the sister was already arrested once for domestic violence. So, the author is taking action to protect themselves and their parents from a dangerous situation. \n\nThe parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life. But the author's main concern is safety. The sister refuses help and is escalating her behavior. In such cases, calling the police isn't just about causing trouble; it's about preventing harm. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, if someone is in immediate danger or knows someone else is, reporting it to the authorities is the right thing to do. The sister's actions are criminal\u2014domestic violence, assault, destruction of property. The author isn't exaggerating; there are specific instances like threats with knives and past arrests. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They acted to protect their family from a known abuser. Even if the parents are upset, the author's responsibility is to ensure their safety. The sister's behavior is beyond just being a difficult sibling; it's a criminal issue that requires intervention.\n"
