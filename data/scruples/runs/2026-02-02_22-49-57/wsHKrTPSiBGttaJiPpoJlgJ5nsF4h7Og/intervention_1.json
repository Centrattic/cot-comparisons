She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling the police on their sister for domestic violence, specifically physical assault and destruction of property. The sister has a history of this, including a previous arrest. The parents are upset and think the author ruined her life.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key elements here. The sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with escalating behavior since returning from university. She yells constantly, hits the parents, and threatens with knives. The author and parents have tried to get her help before, but she refused. The police were called twice now, with the sister's second offense leading to the second arrest. The parents are working class and have supported her despite the financial strain.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, so I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, calling the police might seem harsh, especially if the family is close or the parents are upset. But on the other hand, the sister's actions include physical violence and threats, which are criminal. The author mentions fearing for their safety, which is a strong reason to involve authorities. \n\nI should consider the legal aspect. If the sister has a history of domestic violence and the author reports it to protect themselves and parents, that's a valid action. Parents might feel protective or want to avoid legal consequences for their child, hence their anger. The sister's refusal to seek help compounds the issue. \n\nThe user might be looking for validation that their decision to call the police was right, especially given the severity of the sister's behavior. The sister's actions are clearly abusive and dangerous. The author's parents have consistently caved in, which might have enabled the sister's behavior. The author's full ride to college shows they've made an effort to support their education without burdening the parents, which is a red flag for the sister's entitlement and possible mental health issues.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the line between right and wrong can be blurry, but when there's physical violence and threats, involving the police is generally seen as the correct step. The parents' anger might stem from wanting to protect their child, but the safety of the family should take priority. The author isn't the asshole here; they're acting to protect themselves and their family from clear harm. The sister is the one with the problematic behavior. So, the answer is B.\n"
