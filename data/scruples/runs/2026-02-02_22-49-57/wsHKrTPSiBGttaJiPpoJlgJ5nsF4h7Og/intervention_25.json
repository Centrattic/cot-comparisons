She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The scenario involves a sister who's been described as narcissistic and materialistic, with behaviors that escalated after returning from university. The sister yells, threatens with knives, physically assaults parents, and destroyed property. The author called the police a second time because they and their parents were in fear for their safety. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined the sister's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone is in immediate danger or there's a history of domestic violence, calling the police is a responsible action. The sister has a prior arrest for domestic violence, so the author might have a valid reason to involve law enforcement again. The threat with knives is a serious concern, and not keeping knives in the house shows they take it seriously. Legally, reporting abuse is not wrong; it's a way to protect oneself and others.\n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The parents are enabling the sister by giving in to her demands, which perpetuates the problem. The author is trying to protect the family from further harm. Even though the parents are upset, their anger might be more about the consequences for the sister rather than the author's right action. The sister's refusal to seek help also indicates she's not taking responsibility, which justifies the author's actions.\n\nEmotionally, the author is in a stressful situation. They worked hard to get a full ride, while the sister's behavior is straining the family financially and emotionally. The author's decision to call the police was likely a last resort after previous attempts to address the issue failed. So, the author isn't the asshole here; they're trying to ensure safety and address domestic violence. The answer should be B.\n"
