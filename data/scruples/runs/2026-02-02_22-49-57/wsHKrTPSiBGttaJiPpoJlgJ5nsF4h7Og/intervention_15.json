She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation is pretty intense. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, screaming, physical assaults, and even threatening with knives. The parents are enabling her, and the author felt they had to call the police again because of the danger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone is in immediate danger or there's a history of domestic violence, calling the police is a responsible action. The sister was already arrested before for domestic violence, so this is a second offense. The author mentions fear for their safety and their parents', which are valid reasons to involve authorities.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined the sister's life. But the sister's behavior is abusive and dangerous. The author is standing up for their safety and the safety of others. The sister refuses help and continues to act out, which suggests the author had no better options.\n\nI should also consider if there were alternatives. Maybe the author tried other methods, like seeking help from counselors or legal resources. Since the sister refused help and the situation was escalating, calling the police was a necessary step to protect the family.\n\nSo, based on the information, the author is protecting themselves and loved ones from abuse. They are not the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
