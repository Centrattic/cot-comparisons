She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling the police on their sister for repeated incidents of verbal abuse, physical assault, and threats. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined the sister's life.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, escalating to physical violence and property destruction. The author mentions that the sister was previously arrested for domestic violence, and this is a second offense. The author also states that the sister threatened to attack the family with knives, leading them to not keep knives at home. The parents are not protecting the author or each other, instead giving in to the sister's demands. The author called the police out of fear for their safety and their parents' well-being.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, calling the police when someone is making threats of violence and has a history of domestic violence is generally justified. The author is acting to protect themselves and their family from potential harm. The sister's actions, including hitting parents and destroying property, are criminal, so reporting them isn't wrong. The parents' anger seems to stem from wanting to protect their child, which is a common family dynamic, but that doesn't make the author's actions wrong.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's behavior is clearly abusive and dangerous. The author's decision to involve law enforcement is a reasonable response to ensure safety, especially with prior incidents. The parents' refusal to set boundaries and their support of the abusive sister might be part of the problem, but the author isn't at fault for taking action to protect themselves.\n\nPossible counterarguments might suggest that the author could have tried other methods first, like more counseling or family mediation. But the sister refused help, and the author had already tried getting her to seek professional help without success. Given the sister's history and escalating threats, the author's actions were a last resort to prevent further harm.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They acted to protect their family from a dangerous situation. The parents' perspective is unfortunate but doesn't negate the author's right to seek help from authorities. Therefore, the answer should be B (No)."
