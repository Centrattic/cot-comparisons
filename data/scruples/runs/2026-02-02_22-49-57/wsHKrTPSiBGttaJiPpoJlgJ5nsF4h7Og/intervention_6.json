She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling the police on their sister due to her abusive and violent behavior. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the details from the post. The sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with behaviors escalating after returning from university. She yells at the author, hits the parents, destroys property, and even threatened to attack with knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the author's actions led to the sister's second arrest for domestic violence. The parents are upset, feeling the author ruined her life.\n\nNow, the key points here are about self-defense and protecting family members from harm. The author mentions fearing for their and their parents' safety, which is a serious concern. The sister has a history of domestic violence, and the author's actions were to involve law enforcement, which is a standard response for such threats. \n\nThe author's parents are upset because they feel the action was harsh, but the sister's behavior is clearly abusive and dangerous. The author tried to get help through professionals, which the sister refused. The question is if the author is in the wrong for calling the police. \n\nIn legal terms, if someone is in immediate danger, involving the police is appropriate. The author's concern is valid, especially with the history of violence. The parents' perspective is about the sister's life being ruined, but the author's priority is safety. The sister's refusal to seek help and the ongoing abuse make the author's actions justified. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They acted to protect themselves and their family from harm, which is a reasonable and responsible action.\n"
