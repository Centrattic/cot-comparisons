She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty intense. They have a sister who's been acting out a lot\u2014screaming, being narcissistic, materialistic, and even hitting their parents and threatening them with knives. The parents are caving in to her demands, which is causing a lot of stress. The author called the police on her for a second time because they were scared for their safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's behavior. If she's physically assaulting family members and destroying property, that's definitely not okay. It's domestic violence, which is a serious issue. The author mentions she was arrested once before for the same thing. So, the police have already been involved. The sister refuses help, which is making things worse. \n\nNow, the parents are upset with the author for calling the police. They might feel like they're betraying their daughter, or maybe they fear the consequences of her being arrested again. But the author's main concern is their safety and their parents' well-being. If someone is threatening you with knives and has a history of violence, it's understandable to seek legal help. \n\nIn terms of calling the police, the author is reporting a crime. If there's a risk of harm, that action is justified. The sister's behavior is the problem here, not the author's attempt to protect their family. The parents' reaction might be due to cultural differences or different values, but the author isn't the one committing the wrongdoing. \n\nSo, the key points are: the sister's violent actions, the history of arrests, the refusal of help, and the author's reasonable concern for safety. The author is not the asshole for taking steps to protect themselves and their family from abuse. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
