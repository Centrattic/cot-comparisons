She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they called the police on their sister because she was being abusive, both verbally and physically. The sister has a history of this, like screaming, hitting their parents, and destroying property. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The sister's behavior sounds really extreme. Screaming like a five-year-old whenever she doesn't get her way, and that's been happening even more since she came back from university. Plus, she physically assaulted their parents and the author, and there's a previous arrest for domestic violence. That's a big deal. The author mentions fearing for their and their parents' well-being, which is serious. \n\nNow, the parents are working class and worked hard to fund her education. The sister's actions could be affecting the family's safety and mental health. The author tried to get her help before, like professional help, but she refused. So, the author's step was to call the police again. Since it's the second offense, maybe there's a legal aspect here. If the sister's actions meet the criteria for domestic violence or disorderly conduct, then calling the police is a justified response to protect the family.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, if there's actual abuse and threats, then reporting it to the police is responsible. However, sometimes people might think calling the police is an overreaction. But given the sister's history and the severity (threats with knives, previous arrest), it seems like the author is taking necessary steps to ensure safety. \n\nThe parents are angry, but their perspective is that they don't want to ruin their child's life. However, their child's behavior is harmful and possibly illegal. The author is trying to protect the family from ongoing abuse. In such cases, intervening for safety is usually seen as the right thing, even if it causes family tension. \n\nSo, probably the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They acted to prevent harm and followed through with legal measures when other attempts failed. But I should double-check if there are any nuances I'm missing. For example, if the sister's actions were misunderstandings or if the author exaggerated. But based on the given info, the sister's behavior is clearly abusive, and the author's action was to stop it. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
