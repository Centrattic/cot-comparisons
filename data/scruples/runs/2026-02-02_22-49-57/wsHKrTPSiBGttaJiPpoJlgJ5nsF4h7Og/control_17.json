She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling the police on their sister due to her abusive and violent behavior. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, screams a lot, physically assaults family members, and has already been arrested once for domestic violence. The author's parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the author is concerned about their safety, leading them to call the police again.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if someone is in immediate danger, calling the police is usually the right action. Domestic violence is a criminal offense, so reporting it isn't wrong. The sister's actions are clearly abusive and dangerous, especially with the mention of knife threats and previous arrest. The author's motivation is self-protection and protecting their parents, which is valid.\n\nHowever, the parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life. That's a common conflict in such situations, where family members might downplay abuse. But the author isn't the one committing the abuse. The sister's refusal to seek help also plays a role here.\n\nConsidering all this, the author acted to stop abuse and prevent harm. The sister's actions are the issue, not the author's attempt to get help. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
