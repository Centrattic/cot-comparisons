She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, screaming, and escalating to physical violence and property damage. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands during tantrums. The author mentions that the sister has physically assaulted the parents and threatened them with knives, leading the family to remove knives from the house. The author has called the police twice, leading to the sister's arrest for domestic violence. Now the parents are angry at the author for ruining the sister's life, and the author is questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nI need to consider the legal and moral aspects here. From a legal standpoint, if there's a threat of violence, especially with weapons, calling the police is a reasonable action. Domestic violence is a serious crime, and reporting it is a legal right. The sister has a prior arrest, which makes the second offense even more concerning. \n\nMoral considerations involve family dynamics. The parents are upset because they feel the author is ruining their daughter's life. However, the sister's behavior is abusive and dangerous. The author is trying to protect their family from ongoing harm. The sister's refusal of help and the parents' enabling behavior might be complicating things. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They acted to protect themselves and their family from a known abuser. The sister's actions are criminal, so reporting her should be justified. The parents' anger might stem from cultural expectations or a desire to protect the sister, but that doesn't negate the author's right to seek safety. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the police calls were unnecessary, but given the history of violence and threats, it's hard to see them as excessive. The sister's well-being is a concern, but so is the family's safety. The author isn't the one committing crimes; they're reporting them. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They took necessary steps to address domestic violence and protect their family.\n"
