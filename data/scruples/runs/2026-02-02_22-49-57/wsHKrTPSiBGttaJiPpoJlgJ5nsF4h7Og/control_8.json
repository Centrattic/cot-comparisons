She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they called the police on their sister because she was being abusive. The sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, and her behavior has gotten worse since coming back from university in Australia. She yells a lot, hits the parents, destroys property, and even threatened to use knives.\n\nThe parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life. The author feels justified because they were scared for their safety and the parents' well-being. They mention that the sister was already arrested once before for domestic violence, and this is the second offense. The author also tried to get her to see a professional but she refused. \n\nSo the main question here is whether calling the police to have the sister arrested was the right move. From a legal perspective, if someone is physically assaulting family members and threatening them with weapons, that's domestic violence, which is a crime. The police are there to handle such situations. The sister's prior arrest suggests a pattern of behavior that's not only harmful but also illegal. \n\nThe parents' reaction is understandable from a family standpoint\u2014they might feel protective or worried about their child's future. But the author's priority was safety. If the sister's actions are endangering the family, then reporting it isn't just the right thing; it's necessary. The fact that the author tried to get her help before taking this step shows they made an effort to resolve it without legal action. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a cultural aspect here. In some cultures, family matters are handled internally, and involving the police might be seen as a last resort or a betrayal. The parents are working class and perhaps have limited resources or face stigma if their daughter is arrested. However, the author's well-being and safety are also important. \n\nThe key points are the sister's illegal actions, the prior arrest, and the author's fear for their safety. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting a crime. Emotionally, the family might have a fallout, but that's a consequence of the sister's behavior, not the author's action. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They acted to protect themselves and their parents from a dangerous situation. The sister's actions meet the criteria for domestic violence, and calling the police is a responsible response when other methods have failed.\n"
