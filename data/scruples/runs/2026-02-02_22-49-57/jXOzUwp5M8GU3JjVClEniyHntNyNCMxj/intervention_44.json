We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The question is whether they should have just answered A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a close friend since spring, shared interests, and developed feelings. They confessed, were rejected, and now are avoiding the friend because they can't get over their feelings. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the author is ignoring texts and avoiding her.\n\nSo, the author is wondering if they're the asshole for doing this. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The task is to answer A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nIn relationships, when someone is rejected, even if they were friends, it's natural to feel hurt. But ghosting, which is suddenly cutting off all communication, is generally frowned upon. It's considered inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and can hurt their feelings. The friend in this case is trying to maintain the friendship, so ignoring her might make her feel like the problem is on her end, even though the author is struggling.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with pain and might need space to heal. But the right approach would be to communicate that. If they can't be friends, they should explain it to her, even if it's hard. Ghosting without any explanation is selfish because it doesn't give the friend a chance to understand or respect the boundaries. The author is avoiding the situation instead of addressing it, which could be seen as cowardly.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they have valid reasons for feeling the way they do. However, the way they're handling it by ghosting is where the issue lies. They should have been honest about needing space or not being able to continue the friendship. By not communicating and just disappearing, they might be causing unnecessary distress to their friend. Friends deserve honesty, even if it's painful. So, while the author's feelings are understandable, their actions are inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer would be A (they are in the wrong) because ghosting is not the best approach here. They should have had a conversation instead of cutting off contact abruptly.\n"
