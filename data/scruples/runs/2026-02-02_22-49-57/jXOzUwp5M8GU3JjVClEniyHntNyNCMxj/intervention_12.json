We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, and the friend turned them down but still wants to stay friends. The author is now ghosting them because they can't handle the friendship anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the norms around relationships and friendships. When someone confesses their feelings and it's rejected, but the friend still wants to maintain the friendship, it's generally considered respectful to acknowledge their feelings and try to keep the relationship. However, if the person who was rejected can't move past it and decides to cut off contact, that's a gray area.\n\nThe author is avoiding the friend out of pain. Is that wrong? Well, it's understandable to feel hurt, but ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate. The friend is trying to reach out, so ignoring texts might leave the other person confused or hurt. The author's reasoning is that the friendship can't go back to how it was, but maybe they could have communicated that they need space or can't continue the friendship, which would be more considerate than just disappearing.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author genuinely finds it painful to stay friends, maybe it's better to part ways. It's their emotional well-being. But the ethical side is about being honest and respectful. Ghosting is usually frowned upon because it lacks closure. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong, but they could have handled it better by explaining their feelings instead of just ignoring the friend. The question is whether they are in the wrong for ghosting. Since they are avoiding the friend to protect their own feelings, but not in a respectful way, it's a bit of both. However, the community often leans towards being in the wrong if you don't communicate. So probably answer A (yes) because they didn't handle it with proper communication, even if the feelings are justified.\n"
