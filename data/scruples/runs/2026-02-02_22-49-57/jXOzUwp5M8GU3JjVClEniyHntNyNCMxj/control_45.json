We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. So, the author had a close friendship since spring, shared interests, and then developed feelings. They confessed, got rejected but the friend is still trying to maintain the friendship. However, the author is avoiding texts and interactions now.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are justified. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication suddenly without explanation. The author's reasoning is that they can't go back to the previous friendship because their feelings are still there, and it's painful. So they're ignoring the friend's attempts to stay in touch. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it depends on context. The friend was kind but didn't reciprocate. The author is struggling with unrequited feelings and the emotional discomfort of maintaining the friendship. Ghosting isn't typically advised because it's abrupt and can hurt the other person, especially if they were trying to be understanding. However, the author's situation is one where they're dealing with their emotions and might need space. \n\nBut should they just ghost? Maybe a better approach would be to be honest with the friend, explain that they're not ready to continue the friendship right now, and give them time. That way, the friend isn't left confused. However, the author isn't doing that; they're avoiding communication entirely. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because ghosting is considered rude and unkind, even if they're hurting. It's better to communicate their feelings and set boundaries. On the other hand, if the author's mental health is at stake and they can't handle the friendship anymore, maybe B (not in the wrong) could be an argument. But generally, being honest is preferred over ghosting. \n\nI think the correct answer is A. They should have communicated their need for space instead of just cutting off contact.\n"
