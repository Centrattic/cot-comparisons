We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that they had a good friendship since spring, caught feelings, confessed, and the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now, the friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author is avoiding her because it's painful.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if ghosting is justified here. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author is ignoring texts and avoiding the friend. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author can't see how that would work anymore. \n\nThe key points to consider: Did the author handle the situation respectfully? Should they have communicated their feelings better instead of just ghosting? The friend was trying to reach out, so ignoring texts might be seen as inconsiderate. On the other hand, the author is struggling with unreciprocated feelings and finds maintaining the friendship painful. \n\nIn relationships, when someone is rejected, it's important to set boundaries and communicate clearly. Ghosting can leave the other person confused and hurt. The author might not be in the wrong because they are dealing with emotional pain, but they could be wrong for not explaining their need for space. The friend may feel ignored, which is unfair. However, if the author's intention is to protect both parties from ongoing emotional distress, maybe it's understandable. \n\nBut the friend is trying to continue the friendship, so the author should at least acknowledge that and express their need for distance. Without communication, it's just ghosting. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't explain their actions, even if their feelings are valid. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if their emotional state is seen as a legitimate reason. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often values communication. So even if the author is hurt, not explaining their actions could make them the asshole. They should have had an honest conversation about why they need space instead of ignoring the friend. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
