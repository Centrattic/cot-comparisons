We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author had a friend since spring, good rapport, shared interests. Then they developed feelings but were too scared to act. They confessed, and the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. The friend still wants to stay friends, but the author can't handle being around them because their feelings haven't changed, leading to avoidance.\n\nHmm, the question is about whether ghosting is wrong here. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The friend is trying to reach out and wants to continue the friendship. The author is ignoring texts and avoiding her, which could be seen as ghosting.\n\nOn one hand, the author is hurt and finds it painful to maintain the friendship. It's understandable to need space after a rejection. But on the other hand, the friend is still interested in being friends and might be concerned about why they're being ignored. The author didn't give a reason, which could be hurtful. However, maybe they're just not ready to engage and are trying to protect themselves from further pain. \n\nI think the key points are: the author's feelings are genuine, they don't want to continue the friendship, and they're avoiding the friend. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it leaves the other person confused and can hurt them. But in this case, the friend already rejected them, so maybe the author is just coping. But the friend might not know the author's feelings are still there. The author could have been more upfront about needing space, but they chose to ignore instead. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the friend is genuinely trying to maintain a friendship and the author is cutting off without explanation, that's probably not fair. Even if the author is hurting, communication is important. But if the author's feelings haven't changed and they can't be friends, maybe it's okay to distance themselves. However, ghosting without any communication is usually considered the wrong approach. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to distance, but the method (ghosting) could be. \n\nWait, the user says they don't see how they can be friends anymore and that their feelings haven't changed. So maybe they can't handle the friendship because every interaction is painful. But the friend doesn't know that. The author could have explained their need for space instead of just ignoring. So maybe they are in the wrong for not being honest, but not for wanting to distance. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong for needing space, but the act of ghosting without communication might be. However, the question is about being in the wrong. Since the friend rejected them, the author's feelings are still there, and they're struggling. Ghosting is a reaction to pain. But being inconsiderate by not explaining. So maybe the author is inconsiderate but not necessarily in the wrong. It's a tough call. \n\nBut the general consensus is that ghosting is inconsiderate. However, if the author is truly unable to continue the friendship, maybe it's a self-preservation choice. The answer might depend on the context. But the friend is still trying to reach out, so ignoring without a reason is unkind. However, the author might not have the emotional capacity to handle the friendship. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because they're dealing with their emotions and the friendship is causing them pain. But they should communicate their reasons if possible. However, the question is about being in the wrong. Since they didn't mean to hurt and are acting out of emotional distress, maybe they aren't at fault. So B.\n"
