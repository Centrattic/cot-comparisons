      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting a friend after being turned down. The situation is that they had a good friendship, the author developed feelings, confessed, and the friend didn't reciprocate. Now, the friend wants to continue being friends, but the author is avoiding her because it's painful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. They were friends since spring and shared interests. The author had feelings but didn't act on them for a while, then confessed. The friend was nice but not interested. The author is now ghosting, even though the friend is trying to maintain the friendship.\n\nGhosting is generally seen as cutting off communication abruptly without explanation, which can be hurtful. But here, the author is struggling because their feelings haven't changed, and they find it painful to continue the friendship. They're avoiding texts and interactions. The key points here are the author's emotional state and the friend's attempts to stay in touch.\n\nIs the author justified in their actions? From one perspective, they have the right to their feelings and may need space to process. However, ghosting without communication can leave the friend confused and feeling rejected again, even if the author isn't in a romantic relationship anymore. The friend might not know if it's about the rejection or something else.\n\nBut the author says they don't hold anything against the friend and want to avoid ongoing pain. If the author can't handle the friendship anymore because they can't move past the unrequited feelings, maybe it's better for them to step back. But the right approach would be to communicate that, not just ghost. Ghosting makes it hard for the friend to understand or adjust. The author's decision to avoid might be self-protective, but the method of doing so is questionable.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is wrong for not communicating. Even though the situation is painful, being honest about needing space is usually better than cutting off abruptly. The friend's attempts to reach out might be genuine, and the author's lack of response could make it seem like they're still upset, even if they aren't. Therefore, while the author's feelings are valid, the way they're handling the situation (ghosting) is inconsiderate. The correct answer might be A (they are in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn because the emotional pain is real. However, the ethical thing is to communicate, even if it's hard. So I think the author is in the wrong because ghosting isn't the right approach here.\n"
