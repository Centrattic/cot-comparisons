      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friend since spring, they liked her and asked her out, but she turned them down. Now they're ghosting her because they can't be friends anymore, even though she wants to continue the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author liked their friend, confessed, and was rejected. They feel that being in the friendship is painful now and are avoiding her. The friend is trying to reach out, but the author is ignoring her. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue is whether ghosting is acceptable after a rejection. Ghosting typically means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author can't handle it. Is it wrong to ghost? Well, the author might be feeling hurt and need space, but ghosting can be hurtful too. The question is if the author is at fault here.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel it's too painful to continue the friendship. They might not want to hurt the friend further by being rude, so they're avoiding. But the friend might feel confused or rejected all over again when ghosted. The author could have communicated their need for space more clearly instead of just disappearing. That might have been more respectful.\n\nThe AITA subreddit usually considers both perspectives. If the author is avoiding because of emotional pain, maybe it's understandable. However, not responding to the friend's attempts to reconcile the friendship could be seen as inconsiderate. The friend didn't ask for a romantic relationship, just to maintain the friendship. The author's right to feel hurt doesn't negate the friend's feelings when suddenly cut off.\n\nBut the author hasn't blocked or been confrontational, just ignoring texts and avoiding. So maybe they're trying to be polite, but the lack of communication is making the friend feel like they did something wrong. It's a tricky situation. The author might not be the asshole if they're struggling with their emotions, but they could be wrong for not communicating their feelings properly. \n\nIn some cases, needing time after rejection is okay, but ghosting without explanation can leave the other person hanging. The author should probably tell the friend that they need some distance and explain why, even if they can't be friends anymore. By not doing so, the author might be being inconsiderate. But if the author truly can't handle the friendship and isn't being hostile, maybe the friend is expected to understand. \n\nI think the answer depends on the norms of the community. In AITA scenarios, the person who doesn't communicate their needs and leaves others in the dark is often seen as the asshole. The author is avoiding, which is understandable, but the lack of response might make it AITA. However, if the author's feelings are genuine and they can't maintain the friendship without pain, maybe it's not their fault. \n\nThe options are A (yes) or B (no). The user says they think the author is not in the wrong. I need to decide between A and B. Considering that the author is actively avoiding and not responding, which can be hurtful, but they were honest about their feelings and the rejection is mutual. The friend is trying to salvage the friendship, but the author's pain is real. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is in a tough spot and their actions are a result of genuine emotional difficulty. They were upfront about their feelings and the rejection wasn't their fault. Ghosting isn't ideal, but given the circumstances, it's more about needing space than being malicious. However, I should make sure that the community's perspective aligns with this. In many cases, people are given time to process and it's acceptable to take a break. If the author later reengages, maybe not, but in this case, they're just trying to avoid pain. So B is likely the correct answer.\n"
