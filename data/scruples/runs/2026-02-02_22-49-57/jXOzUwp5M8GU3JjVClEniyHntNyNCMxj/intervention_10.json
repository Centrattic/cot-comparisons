We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting a friend after being rejected.\n\nSo the situation: the author had a close friend since spring, developed feelings, confessed, got rejected but the friend wants to stay friends. The author is avoiding texts and meetings because it's too painful. They feel like they can't go back to the old friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author had a crush, expressed it, and was rejected. The friend is still trying to be friends. The author is ghosting, which is cutting off communication abruptly.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel hurt and unable to move past the rejection. They might believe that staying in the friendship is causing them emotional pain. On the other hand, the friend is trying to maintain the relationship, which could be seen as a genuine effort to preserve the friendship despite the rejection.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. The friend might be confused or hurt if they're trying to reach out and getting no response. The author's decision to avoid the friend could be seen as selfish if it's ignoring the friend's feelings. However, the author is also dealing with emotional pain and might feel that cutting off contact is necessary for their own well-being.\n\nBut the other person was clear they wanted to remain friends. The author's response of ghosting might not be fair to the friend who is making an effort. The author should have communicated their need for space, even if they can't continue the friendship. Ghosting doesn't give the friend a chance to understand or adjust.\n\nSo the author's actions are inconsiderate, but their feelings are valid. However, the right approach would be to be honest about not being able to be friends, even if it's uncomfortable. Ghosting is a passive-aggressive way to handle it. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not communicating their feelings properly and avoiding the situation instead of having an open conversation.\n"
