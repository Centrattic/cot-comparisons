We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The question is pretty straightforward, but I need to consider the nuances here.\n\nFirst, the author had a close friendship with someone they've known since spring. They developed feelings, confessed, and got rejected. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author is finding it hard because their feelings haven't changed. So they started ignoring texts and avoiding the friend, hence ghosting.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it leaves the other person hanging without closure. Even though the author feels it's painful to continue the friendship, they didn't communicate their decision properly. The friend was trying to maintain the relationship, which is a kind gesture, but the author didn't explain why they're pulling away. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, it's better to be honest and set boundaries. If the author can't handle the friendship without pain, they should have told their friend that they need some distance, rather than just ghosting. Ghosting causes confusion and can hurt the other person more than the rejection itself. \n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that they can't go back to the way things were. But they could have handled it with more communication. The fact that they don't hold anything against the friend is a positive point, but the method of withdrawal is the problem. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't provide closure. Even if their feelings are genuine, the lack of communication is what's causing the issue. The correct approach would have been to explain their feelings and set boundaries, not to disappear. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
