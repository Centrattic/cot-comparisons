We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a close friend since spring, developed feelings, confessed them, and was rejected. The friend still wants to maintain the friendship, but the author is avoiding them because they still have feelings and find it painful to continue the friendship. The author is ghosting, which means cutting off communication without explanation.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. When someone is rejected, it's natural to feel hurt. The author might be struggling with unrequited feelings. The friend wants to stay friends, which is common and not necessarily a bad thing. However, the author isn't ready to handle that dynamic and is choosing to ghost instead of communicating their feelings.\n\nGhosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused. The friend is trying to reach out, but the author isn't responding. Even though the author is hurt, not communicating is the problem here. The author could have explained their need for space instead of abruptly cutting off contact. \n\nHowever, the author's feelings are valid. It's hard to be friends when you're still in love. But the way they're handling it (ghosting) might be the issue. The friend might feel rejected again, not understanding why the author is ignoring them. \n\nSo, the main point is about communication. If the author had told their friend that they need time or can't be friends right now, it would be more respectful. Ghosting without explanation is inconsiderate, even if the underlying feelings are real. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not communicating their needs and instead choosing to ghost. The answer would be A, yes, they're in the wrong.\n"
