We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The situation is that they developed feelings for a friend, confessed, got rejected, and now are ignoring her attempts to stay friends. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is in a tough spot. They had a friendship, confessed feelings, and were rejected. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author can't see it working because they still have feelings. So they're ghosting. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, communication is key in relationships, even friendships. If the author can't see the friendship working and is avoiding the person, that's understandable but maybe not the best approach. Ghosting can be hurtful even if they don't mean to be. The friend tried to reach out and the author is ignoring it, which might make the friend feel dismissed. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author is dealing with unrequited feelings, which is tough. They might genuinely find it too painful to continue the friendship. It's possible they're protecting themselves by creating distance. However, the friend didn't do anything wrong by rejecting them. The author's actions are more about their own emotional state. \n\nIs the author responsible for the friend's feelings? They might have an obligation to communicate their need for space instead of ghosting. Ghosting is often seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. The author could have explained their feelings more clearly, maybe saying they need time or that they can't stay friends, which would be kinder. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they're honest with their feelings and need space, maybe not. However, the way they're handling it (ghosting) is wrong because it's abrupt and lacks communication. So, maybe the answer is A. \n\nBut wait, the author is in a position where they can't maintain the friendship as before. They might not be in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being. However, the wrong comes from not communicating properly. So, the act of ghosting is the issue, not the decision to distance themselves. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for ghosting instead of having an open conversation. Hence, answer A.\n"
