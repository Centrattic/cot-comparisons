I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The situation is that they had a good friendship, the author developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now is avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they can't handle being friends anymore because it's painful. Ghosting is a way to protect themselves from ongoing emotional pain. On the other hand, their friend wants to maintain the friendship and is reaching out, which the author is ignoring. \n\nIs there a wrong here? Well, ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and hurt. The friend might feel rejected again, not understanding why the author is avoiding them. The author might not be wrong in feeling that they can't handle the friendship, but the way they're handling it by ghosting could be considered wrong because it's abrupt and lacks communication.\n\nBut maybe the author is justified in needing space. If they can't be friends without it being painful, maybe it's better to step back. However, ghosting isn't the best approach. A more mature approach would be to explain their feelings and set boundaries, even if they can't continue the friendship. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether avoiding communication is considered wrong. If the friend is trying to maintain contact and the author isn't responding, that's ghosting. While the author's feelings are valid, the method of handling it might be at fault. Therefore, the author could be seen as in the wrong for not communicating their reasons and just disappearing. So the answer would be A (Yes), but I need to check again.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is B (No). The author isn't wrong for needing to distance themselves if the friendship is too painful. But the way they're doing it (ghosting) is the problem. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's actions are hurtful but their feelings are valid, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But ghosting is generally considered rude, so maybe A. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. The key is whether the author is wrong in their actions. Since they're not respecting the friend's desire to remain friends without explanation, that's inconsiderate. So A might be correct. But some might argue that the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own well-being. I think the answer is A because ghosting is typically seen as inconsiderate even if the person has valid reasons.\n"
