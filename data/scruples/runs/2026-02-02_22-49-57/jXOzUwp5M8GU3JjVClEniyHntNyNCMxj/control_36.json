      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting a friend after being rejected.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author had a close friend since spring, developed feelings, confessed them, and was turned down. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author is avoiding her by not responding to texts and avoiding interactions. The author is ghosting because they can't see maintaining the friendship without it being painful.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it's abrupt and leaves the other person confused. However, the context matters here. The author is dealing with unrequited feelings and is struggling to handle the friendship post-rejection. They don't hold it against the friend but feel that continuing the friendship is too painful. \n\nIs the author being selfish by cutting off communication? Well, they are protecting their own emotional well-being. But they could have been more honest about their feelings instead of just ghosting. Ghosting isn't the best approach, but the situation isn't entirely their fault. They were honest about their feelings first, which is important. The problem is how they're handling the aftermath. \n\nIn relationships (even friendships), communication is key. The author might not be in the wrong for not wanting to continue the friendship, but they should have communicated their decision more clearly rather than ghosting. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they have a valid reason (unresolved feelings making friendship painful) and they tried to address it, maybe they aren't entirely wrong. But ghosting is still a problem. So maybe the answer is B (No), because their actions are a result of genuine emotional pain, though they could have handled it better. Alternatively, maybe A (Yes) because ghosting is inconsiderate regardless.\n\nWait, but the friend wants to stay friends and is reaching out. The author is ignoring her, which is ghosting. Even if the author is hurt, it's still inconsiderate. The friend might need closure. However, the author's reasoning is valid. So the answer might be B (No), because the author's actions are a result of their emotional state, and they aren't being malicious. But in terms of social norms, ghosting is usually seen as wrong. This is a bit of a toss-up. In AITA scenarios, sometimes people are given leeway if they're dealing with personal issues. But ghosting is often frowned upon. Hmm. Maybe they are in the wrong (A) because they didn't communicate their decision and just disappeared. Even if they're hurt, ghosting is not the right approach. They should have been honest about not wanting to continue the friendship. So the answer would be A. But wait, the user might argue that the author tried to be honest by confessing their feelings. The problem is after the rejection. Maybe the answer is A because ghosting is wrong regardless of the reason.\n"
