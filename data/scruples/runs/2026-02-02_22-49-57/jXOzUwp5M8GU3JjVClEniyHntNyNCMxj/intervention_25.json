We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author had a friend they connected with since spring, shared interests, but then the author developed feelings. They didn't act on it for a while, then confessed, got rejected. The friend is still friendly and trying to maintain the relationship, but the author is finding it painful and has started ignoring her.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate. The friend might feel hurt by the sudden cutoff. The author didn't communicate their feelings about needing space, which could be seen as disrespectful. On the other hand, the author is struggling with unrequited feelings and finds it painful to stay friends. They might be protecting themselves emotionally.\n\nBut is it wrong to ghost? Ghosting is usually considered bad because it leaves the other person in the dark. The author could have set boundaries without cutting off completely. Maybe a conversation would have been better. The friend wants to continue, so the author's response might be unfair to the friend. However, the author has a right to their feelings and need to protect their mental health. \n\nIs there a middle ground? The author could have been honest about not being able to be friends anymore without being ghosting. But they didn't. So by choosing to ignore texts and avoid, without explanation, that's where the issue is. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not communicating, but not necessarily for wanting space. However, the act of ghosting is typically seen as wrong because of the lack of communication. So the answer might be A, but I need to decide based on the options given."
