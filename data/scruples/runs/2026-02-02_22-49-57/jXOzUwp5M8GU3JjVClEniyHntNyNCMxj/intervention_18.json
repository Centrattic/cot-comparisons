We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The person had a close friendship, developed feelings, confessed them, and was rejected. They decided to ghost the friend to avoid ongoing pain. \n\nOn one hand, ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. The friend wanted to stay in touch, so abruptly cutting off communication might hurt her as well. But the person writing the post explains that they can't maintain the friendship because their feelings haven't changed, and it's too painful. \n\nI should think about the ethics here. Is it wrong to prioritize one's own emotional well-being? Maybe not, but how you handle it matters. Instead of ghosting, being honest about needing space might be better. However, the person did try to avoid further pain, which could be seen as self-protective rather than malicious. \n\nAlso, the friend didn't reciprocate, so the rejection wasn't their fault. The issue is the ghosting part. Some might argue that ignoring texts and avoiding someone isn't fair, but others might understand the need to distance. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're dealing with their feelings, but there's a nuance. They could have handled it more gracefully, but the core issue is their right to protect their emotions. Hence, not in the wrong.\n"
