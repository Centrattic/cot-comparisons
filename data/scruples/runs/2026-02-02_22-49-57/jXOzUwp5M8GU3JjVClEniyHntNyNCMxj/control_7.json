      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThey had a friend since spring, and they were close with shared interests. The author developed feelings but was too nervous to act. Then they confessed, but the friend didn't reciprocate. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author is avoiding her by ghosting. The author says their feelings haven't changed and being friends would be painful. The question is whether they're in the wrong for ghosting.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The author was honest about their feelings, which is good. The friend was kind in declining. The author is now avoiding her, which is ghosting. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author can't see how that can work because they still have feelings. So the conflict is between the author's emotional state and the friend's desire to keep the friendship.\n\nIs ghosting the right approach here? Ghosting usually means cutting off contact abruptly without explanation. The author's reasoning is that being friends would be painful because they're still in love. They don't hold the friend's rejection against her and don't have negative feelings. But avoiding the friend might be hurtful in the long run. The friend might not understand why the author is suddenly distant.\n\nOn one hand, the author is protecting their own feelings. On the other, they're not communicating, which can be hurtful. Maybe a better approach would be to explain that they can't be friends and need space, but that's not what they did. By ghosting, they're leaving the friend confused and possibly hurt. However, the author isn't being malicious; they're just trying to protect themselves. \n\nBut is it fair to ghost someone after they've been kind and tried to remain friends? The author could have said they need time to process or that they can't continue being friends. Ghosting is usually seen as inconsiderate because it doesn't give the other person closure. Even if the author's feelings are valid, the way they're handling it might be inconsiderate. However, the situation is tricky. The friend doesn't want to lose the friendship, but the author can't maintain it. Maybe the author is in the wrong because they could have communicated their feelings more clearly instead of ghosting. But maybe it's not entirely their fault if they can't handle the friendship anymore. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author is being honest about their feelings and needs. Ghosting is a problem because it's a lack of communication, but the author's reason is genuine. However, even if you can't be friends, you should communicate that. So the author is in the wrong for not communicating and instead ghosting. But maybe there's no \"wrong\" in terms of emotional response, but the action of ghosting is what's questionable. The answer might be B because the author isn't in the wrong for their feelings, but their method is. Wait, but the question is if the author is in the wrong. In some contexts, ghosting is considered rude regardless of the reason. So the answer might be A. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting. If the author's reasoning is valid but the method is not, then the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
