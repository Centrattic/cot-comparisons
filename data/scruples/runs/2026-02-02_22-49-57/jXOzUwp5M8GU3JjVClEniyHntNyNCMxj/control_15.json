We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. They had a friendship since spring, got close, then confessed feelings. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now, the friend wants to stay friends and has been texting them, but the author is avoiding her because they still have feelings and it's painful.\n\nHmm. First, I need to figure out if ghosting is the right approach here. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication suddenly without explanation. The friend is trying to reach out, but the author is ignoring her. The problem is that the friend might be confused or hurt by the sudden silence. The author's reasoning is that they can't go back to how things were and that being friends would be painful. \n\nOn one hand, it's understandable that having unrequited feelings is hard, and the author might need space. But on the other hand, ghosting can be hurtful for the other person. The friend wants to maintain the relationship, even if just as friends, so ignoring her could be seen as being cold or not considering her perspective. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't ask for the friendship to be ruined, and she's trying to keep it. The author's actions are causing pain, but maybe that's unavoidable if they can't get over their feelings. However, ghosting isn't the best way to handle it. A better approach might be to be honest about needing time or space, but avoiding communication without any notice can be considered inconsiderate. \n\nSo the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because ghosting is generally frowned upon, even if it's for personal reasons. They should have communicated their need for distance instead of just cutting off contact. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if their feelings are genuine and they can't help it. But the key point is that they didn't explain their actions, which could make it seem like they're being selfish. I think the answer is A.\n"
