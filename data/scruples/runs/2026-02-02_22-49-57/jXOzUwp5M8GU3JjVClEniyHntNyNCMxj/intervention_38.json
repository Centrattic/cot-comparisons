We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The situation is that they had a friendship, developed feelings, confessed, and the friend didn't reciprocate. Now the author is avoiding her, and the friend wants to stay friends.\n\nFirst, the user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they're curious about my take. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nHmm. So, in relationships, when someone has feelings and they're not reciprocated, it's tough. The author is struggling with maintaining the friendship because their feelings haven't changed. They find it painful and are avoiding the friend. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? On one hand, ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and hurt, even if the author is hurt. The friend might want closure or understanding. But on the other hand, the author is in a vulnerable position and might need space to heal. \n\nBut the friend is trying to reach out and wants to continue the friendship. The author's avoidance might be causing more hurt now. Even if the author can't be friends, maybe a clear communication that they need time or can't continue the friendship might be better than ghosting. \n\nSo, is it wrong? If the author is avoiding communication and not explaining, that could be seen as inconsiderate. The friend might feel rejected again. But the author is dealing with their own emotions. However, the act of ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's unkind. \n\nBut in this case, maybe the author is justified if they can't handle the friendship anymore. But the friend is trying to mend it, so maybe the author should at least explain their position. \n\nIf the author's intention is to protect their own feelings, that's understandable, but the method of ghosting might be seen as wrong because it doesn't consider the friend's feelings. So, maybe the answer is A (they are wrong), but maybe B (they aren't). \n\nHmm, I think the key point is whether ghosting is the right approach. Ghosting is usually considered inconsiderate regardless of the reason. The author might need to have a conversation to explain their feelings rather than just disappear. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not communicating. \n\nBut the user's initial thought was B. Maybe I should consider that the author is doing this out of pain and not with malice. But still, ghosting is typically seen as inconsiderate. So maybe A is the answer. But I'm a bit conflicted here. \n\nAlternatively, if the author truly can't be friends and needs to cut off contact for their own well-being, maybe it's not wrong. But the right approach would be to explain and set boundaries instead of just ghosting. So the act of ghosting itself is what's problematic, not the decision to distance. So the author is in the wrong for ghosting without communication. Therefore, answer A.\n"
