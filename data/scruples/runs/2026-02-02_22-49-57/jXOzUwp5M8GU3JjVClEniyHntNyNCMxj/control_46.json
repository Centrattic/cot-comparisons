We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting a friend after being turned down.\n\nFirst, the person had a close friendship and developed feelings. They confessed, got rejected, but the friend wants to stay friends. The author is avoiding her now, which is ghosting. The key points here are communication and emotional handling.\n\nThe friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author is cutting off contact. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it leaves the other person confused without closure. Even if the author is hurt, not communicating isn't the healthiest approach. However, the author's feelings are valid; it's hard to be friends after rejection. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. While ghosting is usually wrong, the author's reasoning (can't be friends) might make some empathize. But the friend is trying to be understanding, so ignoring messages lacks respect. The right approach would be to explain the need for space, not just disappear. So the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because ghosting without explanation is hurtful, even if the emotions are valid.\n"
