We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The situation is that the person had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and now can't be friends anymore, so they're ghosting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate the feelings. The person is struggling with the friendship continuing because their feelings haven't changed, and they find it painful. They've been ignoring texts and avoiding her.\n\nIn situations like this, it's common for people to feel hurt after rejection. The key points are how they handle the aftermath. Ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. However, the person might be doing this to protect themselves from further emotional pain. \n\nBut from the friend's perspective, she's trying to maintain a friendship and might not understand why the other person is suddenly distant. Ghosting doesn't give her a chance to address the situation or understand the other person's feelings. While the person might have valid reasons for feeling this way, cutting off communication without explanation is generally considered rude or inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, some might argue that it's their right to distance themselves to avoid ongoing pain. The question is whether they're wrong. In many cases, experts advise communicating even if it's hard, to be respectful. Ghosting can be seen as a lack of communication, which is often frowned upon. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they are avoiding the friend because they can't handle the friendship anymore, maybe they are not entirely wrong, but the way they're handling it (ghosting) is inconsiderate. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, they're in the wrong) because ghosting is not a respectful way to handle the situation, even if their feelings are genuine. Alternatively, if their actions are a personal choice to protect their own well-being, maybe B (No). \n\nBut typically, ghosting is considered a negative action. The right approach would be to explain their feelings to the friend, even if they can't stay in touch. Since they're not doing that and instead cutting off all contact, it's likely they are in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
