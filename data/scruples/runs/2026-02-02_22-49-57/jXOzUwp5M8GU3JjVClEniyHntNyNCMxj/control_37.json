We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after she turned them down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and now they're ignoring her texts and avoiding her. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author can't handle the pain anymore.\n\nSo, the main question is whether ghosting is justified here. The author's reasoning is that they can't be friends anymore because their feelings haven't changed, and being friends would be painful. The friend, on the other hand, is trying to maintain the relationship.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. But the author is dealing with emotional pain. However, there's a difference between needing space and completely cutting off communication. Maybe the right approach would be to communicate their feelings to the friend, explain that they need distance, instead of just ghosting. That way, the friend isn't left in the dark. \n\nBut does that make the author wrong? If they're not being cruel or intentionally hurting, but just trying to protect themselves from further pain, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, not communicating is still a problem. So, maybe the answer is that they are not in the wrong (B) because their actions stem from personal feelings, but they should have communicated better. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about what they should have done. \n\nIn AITA situations, people are often judged based on how their actions affect others. Ghosting, even if understandable, can be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the author's feelings are genuine and they can't handle the friendship anymore, some might say it's not their fault. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling this way, but they could have handled it better. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, and not about the best approach, the fact that they're acting out of their own emotional needs might mean they aren't in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted. Some might argue that ghosting is wrong regardless, but others might empathize with the author's position.\n"
