There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting a friend after she turned them down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The person had a friend they knew since spring, got close, developed feelings, confessed, but she didn't reciprocate. Now, they're avoiding her texts and interactions because they can't go back to being just friends. The person is ignoring her attempts to communicate. The question is whether this is wrong.\n\nSo, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the friend turned them down but still wants to maintain the friendship. The person, however, is struggling with their feelings and finds it painful to continue the friendship. Ghosting might be seen as abrupt and disrespectful, but if they're not ready to be friends, maybe it's understandable.\n\nBut what's the right approach? Usually, when someone is rejected, the appropriate action is to communicate and set boundaries. Ghosting without explanation can be hurtful. However, if the person is emotionally overwhelmed and can't handle interactions, maybe they need space. The friend wants to continue the relationship, but the other person isn't ready. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they just ghosted without explaining, that could be seen as inconsiderate. But if they're being honest with themselves and need time, maybe not. The key is whether they were unkind or if it's a personal choice to distance themselves for their own well-being.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I should consider if there's a lack of communication here. If the author never told the friend they needed space, then ghosting would be inconsiderate. But if they tried to communicate but the friend kept reaching out, and the author needed to step back, that's different. The post says they \"ignored her texts and avoided her.\" So maybe they didn't communicate their feelings anymore. \n\nGhosting is generally frowned upon because it leaves the other person confused. But if the author is genuinely unable to maintain the friendship and it's too painful, even though they're not in a relationship, they might not be wrong. However, the right approach would be to explain their feelings, even if it's hard, rather than just disappearing. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they could have communicated their feelings and chose not to, then maybe yes. But if they're struggling and can't handle the friendship, perhaps not. The answer might be B (No) because the person is acting on their emotional state, not being malicious. But the act of ghosting is still considered poor behavior, so maybe A (Yes). It's a bit of a toss-up. I think the community would lean towards B because the person isn't being cruel, just not ready to be friends. They're not wrong for needing space, but they could have handled it better. Since the question is whether they're in the wrong, and not about the best approach, the answer is B.\n"
