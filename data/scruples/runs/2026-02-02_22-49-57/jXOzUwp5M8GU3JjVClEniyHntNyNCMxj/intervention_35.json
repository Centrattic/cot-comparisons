We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a friend they really liked, confessed their feelings, got turned down, and then started ghosting the friend. They don't want to stay in the friendship because it's painful. The friend wants to keep being friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author was honest about their feelings, which is generally seen as respectful. The friend rejected them, and the author is now struggling with the friendship. They feel that continuing the friendship would be too painful because their feelings haven't changed. The friend is trying to reach out, but the author is avoiding them.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate because the friend might not understand why they're being ignored. The author should probably communicate their feelings instead of just cutting off contact. However, the author did mention they don't hold it against the friend and that it's hard for them. They might need space, which is understandable. \n\nBut from a social standpoint, even if the author is hurt, not communicating and just ghosting can leave the friend confused and hurt. The right approach would be to explain that they need space, perhaps temporarily, rather than ignoring. So there's a balance here between personal feelings and the friend's perspective. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions (ghosting) are causing the friend distress, even if unintentionally. The friend might not realize the author is still having feelings. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not communicating their reasons. However, the author is dealing with emotional pain and might not want to burden the friend with that. \n\nI think the answer hinges on communication. Without communication, the author is being inconsiderate. But if they had explained their situation, it might be more understandable. Since they didn't, they might be in the wrong. But maybe they're still not in the wrong because they're handling their emotions. Hmm. It's a tricky one.\n"
