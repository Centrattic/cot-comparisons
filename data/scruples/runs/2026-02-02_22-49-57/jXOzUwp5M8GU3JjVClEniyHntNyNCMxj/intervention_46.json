We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that they had a friendship, the author developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now is avoiding the friend. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my take.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. The author's problem is that they can't see how the friendship can continue because their feelings haven't changed. Ghosting is when you cut off contact abruptly and without explanation. The friend is trying to stay in touch, but the author is ignoring them.\n\nIs ghosting the right move? Well, communication is usually better than ghosting. The author could have explained their need for space, which might be more respectful. But the author is feeling hurt and wants to avoid pain. However, ghosting can be hurtful to the other person, even if the author isn't in the wrong for their feelings. The friend might be confused or worried if there's no explanation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they have a valid reason for needing space, but ghosting isn't the best approach. They could have been honest about needing time, which would have been more considerate. So maybe the answer is A, they are in the wrong because ghosting without explanation is unkind. But maybe not, because the friend was the one who rejected them, and the author is just trying to protect their feelings. It's a tricky balance between their right to emotional well-being and the friend's right to know.\n\nHmm. In similar situations, it's often advised to communicate, even if it's hard. Ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. So the author might be in the wrong for not communicating their feelings instead of just cutting off. But maybe the answer is B, because they're not obligated to stay friends and their actions are a result of genuine feelings. I'm a bit torn. However, the consensus in many AITA scenarios is that ghosting is often seen as the wrong approach, even if the person has a reason. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
