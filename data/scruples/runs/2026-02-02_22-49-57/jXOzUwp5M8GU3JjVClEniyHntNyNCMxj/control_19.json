We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friend they liked, asked her out, she declined, and now they're ghosting her. The writer says they can't be friends anymore because they still have feelings, and it's too painful.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break it down.\n\nThe writer confessed their feelings, which is a valid action. The friend rejected them, which is her right. The problem arises after the rejection. The writer is avoiding the friend, not responding to texts, etc. Is this justified?\n\nOn one hand, the writer is struggling with unrequited feelings. It's hard to move on, and avoiding the friend might be a way to protect their own feelings. But on the other hand, cutting off a friend without communication could be seen as inconsiderate. The friend wants to maintain the friendship, but the writer can't handle it. \n\nIs ghosting the right move? Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and lacks communication. The writer might be avoiding confrontation, but maybe they should at least explain their feelings. However, the writer is not in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being. They have the right to distance themselves if being around the friend is too painful. \n\nBut is it wrong to ghost? Some people might say it's wrong because it leaves the other person confused. But others might say it's understandable if the person can't handle the friendship anymore. The key is whether the writer is being inconsiderate. They don't hate the friend, just can't be around them. They might need space, which is a common reaction. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a nuanced situation. The writer isn't being malicious, just trying to protect their feelings. However, the lack of communication could be an issue. But since the friend is trying to reach out and the writer is avoiding it, that's where the problem is. \n\nIn AITA forums, the community often looks at intent and whether there's a reasonable justification. The writer's intent is to protect themselves, not to hurt the friend. But ghosting can hurt the friend, even if unintentionally. However, the writer might be in the right because they have a valid reason for needing space. \n\nI think the answer is B (No). The writer isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional health, even if the method (ghosting) is harsh. They should maybe communicate better, but the situation is understandable. So the author isn't the asshole here."
