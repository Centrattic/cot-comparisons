We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friend since spring, developed feelings, asked her out, she said no, and now they're ghosting her even though she wants to stay friends.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's perspective: they confessed their feelings and were rejected. They feel that being friends now is painful because their feelings haven't changed, so they're avoiding communication. The friend, on the other hand, is trying to maintain the friendship, which the author isn't reciprocating by ignoring texts and avoiding her.\n\nNow, considering social norms and relationships. Rejection can be tough, and it's common for people to feel the need to distance themselves after a romantic rejection, especially if they still have strong feelings. However, ghosting someone after a rejection might be seen as inconsiderate. The author could have communicated their need for space or explained why they can't continue the friendship, instead of just cutting off contact. \n\nThe friend's intention to stay friends might be genuine, but the author's emotional state makes it difficult. The key here is whether the author is being fair to the friend by not responding. Ghosting can be hurtful because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. While the author isn't in the wrong for having feelings or needing space, the way they're handling it\u2014by ignoring and avoiding\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't pressuring the friend; they're the ones reaching out. The author might not be obligated to maintain a friendship that's causing them pain. But the issue is that the author didn't communicate their decision clearly. If they had explained that they need time or can't be friends anymore, it would be more respectful. Since they're just ghosting, it's a bit of an AITA scenario because they're avoiding communication, which can be seen as rude.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They're not in the wrong for having feelings or needing space, but the method of handling it (ghosting) is inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their needs properly and left the friend hanging. Alternatively, if the main point is that the friend is trying to stay in touch and the author is justified in distancing, it could be B. But the act of ghosting without explanation is typically seen as the asshole move. Hence, likely answer A."
