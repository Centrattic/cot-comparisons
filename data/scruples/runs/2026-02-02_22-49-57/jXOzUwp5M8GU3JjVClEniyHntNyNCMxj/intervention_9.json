We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person wrote a post about ghosting their friend after she turned them down. They had a friendship since spring, got close, and then the author confessed feelings. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now the author is avoiding her because they can't see the friendship working anymore due to lingering feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether their actions (ghosting) are justified. Let's consider the key points. The author had a crush and made a move, which is a common situation. When rejected, they're struggling with the friendship. Ghosting, or cutting off all contact abruptly without explanation, is often seen as hurtful.\n\nThe author says they don't hold the friend's rejection against her but feel the friendship can't continue. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author is avoiding her. Ghosting isn't typically considered respectful communication. Even if the author is hurting, being honest about the difficulty in continuing the friendship might be better than just disappearing. It could leave the friend confused or wondering what they did wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be protecting their own feelings. They might believe that staying friends would be painful. However, ghosting doesn't give the friend a chance to understand or adjust. A more mature approach would be to explain the situation, even if it's uncomfortable. \n\nSo, while the author has valid feelings, the act of ghosting without explanation is generally considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not communicating their needs clearly instead of cutting off contact abruptly.\n"
