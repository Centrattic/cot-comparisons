We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. \n\nFirst, the situation: they had a good friendship, the author developed feelings, confessed, and was rejected. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author is avoiding them because they still have feelings. So they're ignoring texts and avoiding her.\n\nHmm. On one hand, ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate. It can leave the other person confused and hurt. The friend tried to maintain the friendship, but the author is cutting off communication. That seems harsh. But on the other hand, the author is dealing with unrequited feelings and finds it painful to continue the friendship. It's a tough situation where they might feel they can't be around someone they still like, even as a friend.\n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, maybe. Ghosting isn't ideal. They could have communicated their feelings more clearly and set boundaries instead of just disappearing. That might have been more respectful. However, if they truly can't handle being in the friendship anymore, maybe it's understandable. But they should have explained why instead of just ghosting. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not being honest and upfront with their friend about their struggles, leading to the ghosting.\n\nBut the other perspective is that the author is prioritizing their own emotional well-being. If they can't be friends without it being painful, maybe they're not wrong to step back. The problem is how they did it. Instead of ghosting, they should have had a conversation. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, but they could have handled it better. The question is whether they're in the wrong for ghosting. Ghosting is usually frowned upon, but the context is that they can't maintain the friendship. So it's a tricky case. I think the answer is B, not in the wrong, but with a note that they should have communicated better. Since the options are A or B, the answer would be B.\n"
