We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after ghosting a friend who turned them down. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a close friend they've known since spring, shared interests, and developed feelings. They confessed their feelings, got rejected but kindly, and now the friend wants to stay in touch. The author is avoiding the friend because they can't see how they can remain friends, leading to ghosting.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The answer should be A or B. \n\nHmm. So, in terms of social norms, when someone is rejected, it's often advised to take some time to process emotions before deciding on the friendship. Ghosting can be seen as harsh because it leaves the other person without closure. However, the author is struggling with their feelings and might not be ready to maintain the friendship. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend is trying to remain in contact, showing willingness to keep the friendship. Ghosting might be inconsiderate because the friend doesn't understand why communication is being cut off. But the author's feelings haven't changed, so staying friends could lead to ongoing emotional pain. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, it's a tough spot. The author is not being malicious, just struggling with their emotions. Ghosting isn't the healthiest approach, but given the circumstances, it's a way to protect themselves. However, maybe the better approach would be to communicate their need for space instead of ghosting. But since the author hasn't done that, some might say they're in the wrong for not being honest. \n\nBut since the question is whether they're in the wrong, considering the information given, the author's intention is not to hurt but to protect themselves. So, maybe B (not in the wrong). But others might argue that ghosting is inconsiderate regardless. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think in AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and alternatives. The author's intent isn't malicious, but the method (ghosting) could be seen as wrong. However, if the author can't handle the friendship and isn't ready, maybe they aren't at fault. I'm leaning towards B, but I'm a bit conflicted. Maybe the author could have handled it better, but that doesn't necessarily make them in the wrong. It's more of a situational thing where both sides have valid points. So, probably answer B.\n"
