      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that they had a friendship since spring, they developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now are avoiding the friend. The friend still wants to continue the friendship but the author can't see how that would work because their feelings haven't changed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. When someone confesses their feelings and gets rejected, it's natural to feel hurt. The author is choosing to ghost instead of dealing with the friendship. Ghosting can be seen as cutting off communication abruptly without explanation, which can hurt the other person. But in this case, the author is avoiding because they can't handle the friendship anymore. The friend, on the other hand, is trying to maintain the relationship. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, if the friendship is no longer possible for the author, maybe they should have communicated that instead of ghosting. Ghosting can be hurtful even if the reason is emotional difficulty. The friend might feel confused or rejected again. However, the author's feelings are valid too. They might need space, especially if being around the friend is painful. \n\nBut the key point here is whether the author is being inconsiderate. The friend wants to continue the friendship, so the author should at least explain their need for distance. Ghosting without a reason can make the friend think they did something wrong beyond the initial rejection. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate their feelings properly. Instead of ghosting, they should have set boundaries or explained their need for space. \n\nOn the other hand, if continuing the friendship is too painful, maybe they aren't in the wrong for removing themselves. It's a tough spot. But the best approach is usually communication, even if it's hard. So the author might be in the wrong for not explaining their actions, leading to confusion and potential further hurt for the friend. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes) because ghosting is inconsiderate, but there's a balance here. Alternatively, maybe B (No) because the author's feelings are valid. \n\nHmm. I think the consensus in such situations usually leans towards the person who ghosted being wrong because communication is key. So the answer is likely A.\n"
