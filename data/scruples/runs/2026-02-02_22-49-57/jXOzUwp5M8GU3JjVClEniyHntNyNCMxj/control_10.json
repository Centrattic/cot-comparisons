      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a friend they've known since spring. They developed feelings for this friend but were too scared to act. Eventually, they confessed their feelings and were turned down. The friend remained nice and wants to stay friends, but the author is now ignoring her texts and avoiding her, essentially ghosting her. The author says their feelings haven't changed and that being friends would be painful, so they choose to distance themselves.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nLet me think about the key points here. The author initiated the confession, which is honest, even if it was scary. The friend turned them down but still wants to maintain the friendship. The author is struggling with their feelings post-rejection. They feel that continuing the friendship would be painful, so they're choosing to ghost the friend instead of having a conversation.\n\nNow, from a typical social perspective, when someone is rejected in a romantic context, it's often advised to either move on or at least maintain the friendship if the other person is willing. However, if the person can't handle the friendship post-rejection, it's better to have an open and honest conversation rather than just ghosting. Ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. \n\nIn this case, the friend is trying to reach out and wants to continue the friendship. The author is avoiding communication, which might be hurtful to the friend. The author's reasoning is that they still have feelings, so being around her is painful. While that's understandable, the right approach would be to communicate that, even if it's hard. By ghosting, the author isn't allowing the friend to adjust or understand the situation, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, sometimes people do need space after a rejection, especially if they can't see a way to be friends. The key here is whether the author's actions are respectful. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it's abrupt and doesn't provide closure. The author could have explained their need for space without being confrontational, but instead chose to disappear, which might be seen as the wrong approach.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for feeling that they can't continue the friendship, but the way they're handling it (ghosting) is. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, they are in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and closure, even if their feelings are genuine.\n"
