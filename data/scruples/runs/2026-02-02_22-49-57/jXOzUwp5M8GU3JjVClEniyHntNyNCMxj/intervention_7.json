We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that the author had a close friend since spring, developed feelings, confessed them, got rejected, and now is avoiding the friend to avoid the pain of being around them.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if ghosting is justified here. The author's friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author can't handle it because their feelings haven't changed. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The user says the author is ignoring texts and avoiding her. \n\nOn one hand, the author is hurt and might not be ready to be friends again. It's natural to need space after a rejection. But on the other hand, ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate. The friend might be confused or hurt by the sudden silence. The author could have been honest about needing space instead of just disappearing. \n\nHowever, the post says the author doesn't hold the friend against her and just doesn't see how they can be friends anymore. They might be protecting themselves from further pain. But by not communicating, they're leaving the friend in the dark, which can be hurtful. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, while their feelings are valid, the way they handled it might be. The right approach might have been to explain that they need time or space, rather than ghosting. But if the author is truly not able to handle the friendship and can't communicate, maybe it's a middle ground. However, most people would argue that being honest, even if it's hard, is better than ghosting. So the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their need for space. Alternatively, if the author is just struggling with their emotions and can't handle it, maybe B (No). But I think the consensus would be that ghosting is inconsiderate, hence A.\n"
