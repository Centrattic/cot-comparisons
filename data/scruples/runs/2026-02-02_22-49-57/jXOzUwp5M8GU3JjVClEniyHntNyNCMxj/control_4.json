We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo the scenario is: the person had a friend since spring, they got along well. They developed feelings but were too shy to act. Then they confessed, but the friend didn't reciprocate. Now, the friend wants to stay in touch, but the author is ghosting them, ignoring texts and avoiding them. The author feels that being friends would be painful since their feelings haven't changed.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. When you have feelings for someone and they don't reciprocate, it's natural to want space to heal. The author isn't angry or holding a grudge; they just can't handle the friendship anymore because it's causing them pain. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author is setting boundaries by ghosting.\n\nNow, is ghosting a wrong move here? Well, ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. However, in this case, the author might be doing it to protect their own emotional well-being. They're not trying to be cruel but are struggling to handle the situation. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The key points: they were honest about their feelings, the friend rejected them. The author is choosing to distance themselves to avoid ongoing pain. While it's hurtful to be ghosted, the author's actions stem from their own emotional need. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their mental health. They tried to be friends, but it's just too painful. However, the method of handling it (ghosting) could be seen as inconsiderate. But the question is whether the author is \"in the wrong\" overall. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), because the author isn't being malicious. They're dealing with their feelings, and sometimes people can't maintain a friendship after unrequited love. The wrong would be if they were hostile or spreading rumors, but here it's just avoiding. So the author isn't necessarily wrong; they're just handling the situation in a way that's difficult but understandable.\n"
