We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author had a friend they liked since spring. They developed feelings, confessed, and got rejected. Now, they're ghosting the friend because they can't see being friends anymore. The friend is trying to stay in touch, but the author is avoiding them. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know if they are.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author was in a friendship that turned into a crush. When rejected, they tried to move forward but found it hard. Ghosting is a common response when someone can't handle the emotional aftermath of rejection. \n\nOn one hand, ghosting is usually seen as rude because it leaves the other person hanging without explanation. The friend might feel confused or hurt. On the other hand, the author is managing their own emotional pain. They might not have the capacity to maintain the friendship, and it's their right to step back if being friends is too painful.\n\nI should think about whether the author is being inconsiderate. They said they don't hold it against the friend and still have positive feelings, but they can't continue the relationship. If they've given the friend the benefit of the doubt and still can't move forward, maybe it's reasonable to distance. However, not communicating could be seen as harsh. The friend might deserve a clear reason to avoid confusion.\n\nBut in the scenario, the author mentions they've been avoiding texts and approach. The friend is making effort to stay in touch, while the author is pulling away. The key point is whether the author's actions are justified given their emotional state. If they can't handle the friendship anymore, maybe it's better to end it rather than leave the friend in limbo. However, ghosting lacks communication, which is a downside. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often take sides based on intentions and actions. The author's intention is to protect their own feelings, which is understandable. But the action of ghosting might be seen as inconsiderate. However, considering the author's perspective, they're struggling to maintain the friendship, so maybe it's not their fault. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. They might be inconsiderate by not explaining, but their emotional state is valid. The answer likely depends on cultural norms around communication in friendships. If you need to end a friendship, it's better to be clear, but the author isn't malicious here. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author isn't being malicious and their actions stem from genuine emotional difficulty, even if the method (ghosting) is inconsiderate. The problem isn't their fault but the situation's complexity. So they're not in the wrong.\n"
