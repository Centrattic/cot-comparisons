We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the a**hole for ghosting their friend after she turned them down. They've been friends since spring, had a lot in common, and the user developed feelings. They confessed, got rejected but were treated nicely. The friend wants to stay friends, but the user feels they can't because their feelings haven't changed and it's too painful. Now they're ignoring texts and avoiding her.\n\nFirst, let me break it down. The user had a friend, then had a crush, asked her out, she said no. Now the user is avoiding her. The question is whether the user is wrong for ghosting.\n\nI know that ghosting is generally considered rude because you don't respond or communicate. But the user's reason is that they can't handle being friends anymore. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the user feels it's too painful. \n\nIs it wrong to ghost in this case? Well, the user could have been honest about their feelings and the fact that they can't be friends anymore. Ghosting without explanation might leave the friend confused or hurt, even if the user isn't interested romantically. \n\nOn the other hand, the user is dealing with emotional pain. They might feel that cutting off is the only way to protect themselves. However, communication is usually better. Instead of ignoring, maybe they should have told the friend they need space or can't continue the friendship. \n\nSo, the user's actions (ghosting) are impolite and inconsiderate because they're not communicating. The right approach would have been to have a conversation, even if it's awkward. By ghosting, they're leaving the friend in limbo without closure. \n\nTherefore, the user is in the wrong because they didn't communicate their feelings and instead chose to avoid the person without explanation. The answer would be A (yes, in the wrong).\n"
