      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The friend has known them since spring, they were close, and the author developed feelings. They confessed and got rejected, then started ignoring texts and avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says they were friends for a while and had a lot in common. After the rejection, they feel that being friends is painful now. They don't hold it against the friend, but they can't see going back to how things were. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author is ghosting them.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether ghosting is justified here. In relationships, especially romantic ones, honesty is important. The author was honest about their feelings, which is good. However, after the rejection, the friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author is avoiding it. Ghosting usually means cutting off contact suddenly without explanation, which can be hurtful. The author's reasoning is that it's painful for them to stay in contact. But even if it's painful, is it wrong to ghost someone who wants to remain friends?\n\nFrom a typical social perspective, not responding might be seen as harsh, especially since the friend is trying to reach out. However, the author is dealing with emotional pain. Maybe they need space to heal. The friend might not be respecting the author's need for distance, but the author could be inconsiderate by not explaining their actions. \n\nBut in the post, the author does mention that they don't want to continue the friendship because their feelings haven't changed. So if they can't be friends anymore, maybe they should have communicated that instead of ghosting. However, the friend is the one who rejected the romantic interest. The author might feel that being in the friendship now is hard because they can't just be friends anymore. \n\nI think the key point is whether the author is being fair to the friend by not responding. Ghosting can be seen as a form of emotional rejection. If the author isn't interested in maintaining a friendship, it's better to be upfront. However, given the initial rejection, the author's feelings are understandable. They might be avoiding the situation to protect themselves. But the friend is also trying to move past it, so not responding could be seen as not giving the friend a chance to adjust. \n\nSo, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they're dealing with their own emotions, but it's still not the best approach. The better thing would be to explain their reasons for needing space, but the ghosting itself could be considered inconsiderate. However, the situation is complex because the friendship was already affected by the unrequited feelings. \n\nIn some cases, people need time and space after a rejection, and it's okay to take that time. But ghosting can leave the other person confused. The friend might feel hurt or rejected again. On the other hand, the author might not be ready to interact yet. \n\nI'm a bit torn. The author isn't being malicious, but they are not being honest about their lack of communication. The answer might depend on cultural expectations or how the friendship was handled. If the friend was supportive and the author is just overwhelmed, then maybe it's a temporary withdrawal. But if the author is completely cutting off communication without any explanation, that's where the issue lies. \n\nIn typical AITA cases, the person who stops communication without a clear reason is often seen as the asshole, even if they have valid reasons. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they should communicate their need for space instead of ghosting. But the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nHmm. The user's reasoning is that the author is in a painful situation and can't see going back to the friendship. The author isn't angry or resentful, just can't handle it. So perhaps in this case, the author is not in the wrong, but their method of handling it is. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend is trying to maintain the friendship and the author is ghosting, that's being inconsiderate. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author isn't malicious, but they might be handling it poorly. The main issue is the ghosting, but the underlying reason is unrequited love leading to emotional pain. So the author isn't in the wrong, but could improve by communicating better. So the answer is B.\n"
