We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that they had a close friendship, developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now are avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author liked their friend, asked them out, and was turned down. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author can't handle it anymore because their feelings haven't changed, leading them to ghost.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person in the dark. But the author has a valid reason: they can't move past their feelings. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author is struggling. Emotionally, it's tough. However, communication is key in such situations. Instead of just ghosting, maybe the author should have explained their need for space more clearly. But the friend is also being persistent, which might make it harder.\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't wrong for needing space after rejection. It's natural to feel hurt. On the other hand, ghosting can be hurtful to the other person. The friend might not understand why they're being ignored. The author could have been more upfront about needing time or distance. But the question is whether they're \"in the wrong.\" Since the author's actions are a reaction to their own emotional pain, and they didn't intend to hurt their friend, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But they could have communicated better. The answer might be B, but with a note about communication. However, the user is asking for a binary answer. Considering that the author's actions, while hurtful, are a result of their own emotional struggle and not malice, the answer is B.\n"
