There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they have a friend they've known since spring. They developed feelings for her, confessed, and she turned them down. Now they're ghosting her because they can't see being friends anymore and find it painful. She's trying to keep in touch, but they're ignoring her texts and avoiding her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The person confessing their feelings is a big step, and it's understandable that rejection can be hurtful. But the friend said she's okay with staying friends. The original question is whether ghosting her makes the author wrong.\n\nGhosting is generally seen as cutting off communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. The author's reasoning is that they can't handle the friendship anymore because their feelings haven't changed. But maybe there's a better way to handle it than just ghosting. They could have explained their feelings, set boundaries, or given space. However, the author might be doing this to protect themselves emotionally. But since the friend is trying to maintain the friendship, ignoring her could be seen as dismissive or inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't blocking her or being rude; they're just not responding. If the friend is persistent, maybe the author needs to communicate their need for space. But does that make them in the wrong? It depends on the intent. If they're being passive-aggressive instead of honest, that's a problem. But if they're genuinely struggling and trying to protect their feelings, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, ghosting can be hurtful regardless, so perhaps they should have been more direct. But the question is whether they are in the wrong, not just if there's a better approach.\n\nI think the key point is whether the author's actions are justified given the circumstances. They're not being malicious, just trying to cope. But they're not respecting the friend's attempts to remain in contact, which could be seen as inconsiderate. However, it's their right to need space. It's a tricky balance. I'm leaning towards them not being in the wrong because they're acting on their emotions, but maybe there's a better way. But the question is about being in the wrong, so maybe the answer is B, No.\n"
