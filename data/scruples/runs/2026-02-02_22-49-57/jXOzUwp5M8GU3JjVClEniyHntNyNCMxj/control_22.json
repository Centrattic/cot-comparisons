      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user met their friend in the spring and they had a lot in common. They developed feelings but were too scared to act on them. Then they confessed their feelings and asked the friend out. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. The user doesn't hold it against her and still respects her, but now they can't go back to the previous friendship. The friend wants to stay in touch, texts and tries to approach, but the user is ignoring her and avoiding her, which is ghosting. The user's reasoning is that staying friends would be painful because their feelings haven't changed.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Let's consider the perspectives here. On one hand, the user was honest about their feelings, which is good. The friend was clear she didn't feel the same. The user is struggling with the shift from friends to not being in a relationship, which is a common issue. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation, leaving the other person confused. The friend wants to maintain the relationship, even if just as friends, but the user is avoiding her. \n\nHowever, the user's emotional response is understandable. Unrequited feelings can lead to pain, and some people might not be able to handle the friendship anymore. The problem here is the lack of communication. Instead of ignoring texts, the user could have explained their need for space or that they can't continue the friendship. Ghosting might prevent the friend from understanding, causing hurt feelings. \n\nBut the user isn't angry or resentful; they just find it painful. So maybe they're not being inconsiderate, but the act of ghosting is still the issue. The friend is trying to reach out, and the user is cutting her off. Even if the user can't be friends, a direct conversation would have been better. So, the user isn't wrong in feeling hurt, but their method of handling it by ghosting could be seen as wrong because it's abrupt and lacks communication. \n\nIn many cases, people argue that ghosting isn't the best approach because it's disrespectful. The user could have been honest about needing time or space, which would have been more considerate. So the answer might be A, the user is in the wrong for ghosting without communication. But some might say they have the right to decide their own boundaries, so B. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up, but usually, communication is key even in difficult situations. Ghosting doesn't give the other person closure. Therefore, the user is in the wrong for not communicating their decision to distance themselves properly.\n"
