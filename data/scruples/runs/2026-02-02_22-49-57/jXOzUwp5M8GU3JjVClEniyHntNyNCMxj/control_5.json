We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The situation is that they had a good friendship, confessed their feelings, and got rejected. Now they're ignoring the friend's attempts to stay in touch because they can't go back to being just friends. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication suddenly without explanation. The friend was trying to maintain the friendship, but the author is avoiding all contact. Was the author too forward, or is this a common reaction? \n\nIn relationships, sometimes people do get rejected, and the question is about handling the aftermath. The author says they don't hold a grudge and want to stay friends, but their feelings haven't changed. The friend, on the other hand, wants to continue the friendship. So the author is choosing to distance themselves to avoid pain, but by ghosting, they might be hurting the friend more because the friend isn't aware of the reason.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, it's their choice to not be friends anymore, but the way they're doing it is abrupt. Maybe they should have communicated their need for space or explained that they can't continue the friendship. Ghosting is often seen as rude because it leaves the other person confused and feeling rejected again. The author might be in the wrong not for wanting distance, but for not being honest about it. They could have been upfront about their feelings remaining the same and that they need time or can't be friends anymore, which would be more respectful even if it's painful for the friend to hear. So the answer would be A because they are in the wrong for ghosting instead of communicating their decision properly.\n"
