We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The question is asking whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a friend they knew since spring, got close, developed feelings, confessed them, but the friend didn't reciprocate. Now, the friend wants to continue being friends, but the author is avoiding them because they can't see how the friendship can continue without pain. They're ignoring texts and avoiding contact, which is ghosting.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate both perspectives. On one hand, the author might feel that their feelings make it hard to maintain the friendship, and they're not holding it against the friend. They might be trying to protect themselves from further hurt. On the other hand, ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate because the friend is reaching out and wants to keep the relationship, even if it's platonic. Ghosting might hurt the friend who's not aware of the author's reasons and could leave them confused or feeling rejected again.\n\nIn relationships, communication is usually valued. If the author had been honest about their inability to continue the friendship, maybe that would have been better. But the author is choosing to cut off contact instead of explaining. That could be seen as inconsiderate because the friend is making efforts to reach out. However, the author's actions are a result of emotional distress and the difficulty of maintaining a friendship after unrequited feelings.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms as well. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it lacks communication. The author might not be wrong in feeling that they can't handle the friendship anymore, but the method of ending it (ghosting) without explanation could be problematic. The friend might deserve a clear message to understand the situation.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the author's emotional state is valid, but the act of ghosting could be seen as inconsiderate. The right approach might have been to set boundaries while being honest. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate even if the reasons are valid.\n"
