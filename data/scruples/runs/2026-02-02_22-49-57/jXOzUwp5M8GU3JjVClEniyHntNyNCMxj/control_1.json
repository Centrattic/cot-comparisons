      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person had a friend they really liked, developed feelings, confessed, but the friend didn't reciprocate. Now, the friend wants to stay friends, but the author is ghosting them because they can't handle the pain of being around someone they still have feelings for. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. The author and their friend had a good relationship, shared interests, and had been friends since spring. The author's feelings were unrequited, which can be really tough. Confessing feelings is a big step, and the friend handled it nicely but turned them down. The author now feels that the friendship can't go back to how it was, and they're avoiding the friend to avoid the pain of being in a friendship where their feelings aren't returned.\n\nNow, the friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author is ghosting them. The key points here are about respecting the friend's wishes versus the author's emotional needs. If the friend wants to stay friends and the author can't, maybe it's the author's choice to step back. However, ghosting\u2014suddenly cutting off communication\u2014can be seen as inconsiderate, even if the author is doing it for their own emotional well-being.\n\nBut then again, the author might not be able to maintain the friendship without it being painful. In that case, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to distance themselves. However, there's an expectation in many relationships that you communicate your feelings, even if you can't continue the friendship. Ghosting without explanation could leave the other person confused or hurt, even if the author is trying to be self-protective.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer might depend on whether they've communicated their need for space. If they've just stopped responding without telling the friend why, that's more inconsiderate. But if they had a conversation and said they need to take a break, that's different. The post says the author is ignoring texts and avoiding the friend, which sounds like they haven't communicated their feelings, leading the friend to be confused. In that case, the author might be in the wrong for not being honest, even if their decision is understandable.\n\nBut the question is whether they're in the wrong for ghosting. If the friend is trying to maintain the friendship and the author is unable to, but hasn't communicated that, then maybe the author is being inconsiderate. Alternatively, if the author can't handle the friendship and is honest about it, that's more respectful. Since the author is ghosting without explanation, that might be the issue. So the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not communicating their feelings and are avoiding the situation instead of having a conversation with the friend. \n\nAlternatively, some might say that the author isn't in the wrong because they can't force themselves to be friends with someone they have unrequited feelings for. But the problem is the method of cutting off contact. So maybe the answer is A because ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate, even if the person has valid reasons. The right thing would be to explain their feelings and need for space rather than just disappearing.\n"
