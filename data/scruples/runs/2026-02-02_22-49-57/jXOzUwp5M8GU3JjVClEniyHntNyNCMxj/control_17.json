We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The story is that they had a good friendship, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and now they're avoiding the friend. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the author can't handle being around them because their feelings haven't changed, causing pain.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if ghosting is justified here. Ghosting generally means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author is doing that after a romantic rejection. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author is struggling to move past their feelings. \n\nThe key points are: the author confessed, was rejected, and the friend is still being friendly. The author is ghosting to avoid pain. Is that wrong? Well, it's a tough situation. On one hand, the friend might be hurt by the sudden withdrawal. On the other, the author is dealing with unrequited feelings and finds it painful to continue the friendship. \n\nBut ghosting is often considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. The author might have handled it better by explaining their need for space, but the fact that they're in pain isn't their fault. The rejection was a valid reason for their discomfort. However, the act of ghosting could be seen as selfish, not considering the friend's feelings. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because their feelings are genuine. But the method of handling it (ghosting) is questionable. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether their method is the best. Ghosting is a social faux pas, but the underlying reason is understandable. So, is the author at fault? It's a bit of a gray area. If the friend is still trying to maintain the relationship, the author should at least communicate their feelings instead of cutting off contact. But the author is in emotional pain, which is a real issue. \n\nI think the answer might be B (No), because the author's feelings are valid and unrequited love can make continuing a friendship difficult. However, the lack of communication is a problem. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" not about the best approach. So maybe the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but could have handled it better. The main issue is the ghosting, but the reason is understandable. So the answer is likely B.\n"
