We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The situation is that they had a good friendship, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and now are avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The writer developed feelings for their friend, asked her out, and she said no. They don't hate her, but can't see how they can remain friends. So they started ignoring her texts and avoiding her, which is ghosting.\n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong. AITA usually considers social norms and empathy. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it doesn't give the other person closure. But there are exceptions. The writer's reasoning is that they can't handle the friendship anymore because of lingering feelings, which is understandable. However, avoiding someone without explanation can be hurtful, even if you don't want to be friends anymore. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend is trying to maintain the relationship, which the writer feels is impossible. Maybe the writer could have communicated their need for space instead of ghosting. But some might argue that if the friendship is too painful, it's okay to step back. \n\nBut in most cases, ghosting is frowned upon because it's abrupt and doesn't allow the other person to understand the reason. The friend might be confused or worried, thinking something else is wrong. So the writer's approach is not good. They should have at least explained that they need time to adjust or can't continue the friendship as before. \n\nSo the answer is probably A (they are in the wrong) because ghosting isn't the best way to handle this. They should communicate even if they can't be friends anymore.\n"
