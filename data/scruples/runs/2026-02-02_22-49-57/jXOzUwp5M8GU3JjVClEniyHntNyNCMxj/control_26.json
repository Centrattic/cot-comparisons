      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong after ghosting their friend after being rejected. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had a friend since spring, got close, developed feelings, confessed them, and were rejected. The friend still wants to maintain the friendship, but the author can't see how they can stay friends and have been avoiding the friend. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for ghosting. Let me break this down. Ghosting usually refers to suddenly cutting off communication without explanation. The author is avoiding texts and interactions. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author is struggling with lingering feelings. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, being honest about your feelings is important. The author tried to be upfront by confessing their feelings. The friend didn't reciprocate, which is common. Now, the author is finding it hard to continue the friendship because of unresolved feelings. \n\nBut ghosting is typically seen as inconsiderate. Even if the author is hurt, cutting off communication without explaining might leave the friend confused or hurt. However, the author's reasoning is that remaining friends is painful. They might be protecting themselves and the friendship by creating distance. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has a right to their feelings and may need space. On the other, ghosting can be hurtful if the friend doesn't understand why. But in this case, the author tried to explain their situation before the rejection, so maybe they have a valid reason. \n\nAlso, the friend is trying to reach out, so maybe the author should have communicated their need for space instead of ghosting. But maybe they're doing it to avoid causing more pain. \n\nHmm. The key points are: honesty in the confession, the friend's rejection, the author's struggle to maintain the friendship, and the decision to ghost. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're dealing with their emotions. However, ghosting might not be the best approach. They could have explained their need for distance instead of cutting off. But since they've already done it, maybe they're not wrong because they're prioritizing their emotional well-being. \n\nSo, the answer might be B, they are not in the wrong. But I need to make sure. Let me check again. The user is asking if they're in the wrong. If the author is handling their feelings and making a tough decision, maybe they aren't. But if ghosting is inconsiderate, then maybe they are. \n\nI think the consensus would be that while it's understandable, ghosting is still not ideal. However, given the circumstances, the author's actions are more about self-preservation. So maybe B is correct.\n"
