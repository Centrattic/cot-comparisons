We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after ghosting a friend who rejected them. The situation is that they had a close friendship, developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now are avoiding the friend to avoid ongoing pain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author argues that they can't go back to being friends because their feelings haven't changed, and staying in contact is painful. The friend wants to maintain the friendship. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for people to feel hurt after rejection. Ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate, but it's also about self-preservation. The author isn't being hostile; they're just trying to protect themselves from ongoing discomfort. On the other hand, the friend might feel confused or hurt by the sudden distance, but the author isn't the one who rejected the other, so their actions here are more about their own emotional state.\n\nIs ghosting acceptable? It's a gray area. Some might say it's unfair to the friend who wants to continue the relationship, but others might understand the author's need to distance. The key here is that the author isn't holding a grudge. They acknowledge the rejection was handled nicely and don't blame the friend. Their decision is based on personal feelings, not malice.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and harm. If the author is not being vindictive but is acting to protect their own well-being, they might not be seen as the ass. However, communication is usually encouraged. The author could have explained their feelings instead of ghosting, but since they did ghost, some might argue that's inconsiderate. However, given the emotional state, it's understandable.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but it's a bit nuanced. The author's actions are more about self-care, even if the method is abrupt. The main point is the lack of malicious intent and the friend's continued attempts to reconnect without the author's ability to reciprocate.\n"
