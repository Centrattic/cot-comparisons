We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting a friend after being rejected. The situation is that the author had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and now are avoiding the friend. They feel that they can't be friends anymore because their feelings haven't changed and it's too painful.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the author had a friendship, developed feelings, confessed, was rejected, and then ghosted the friend. The friend wants to maintain the friendship, but the author can't handle it and is avoiding them.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user already thinks the author isn't, but wants to know my take. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate. It can be hurtful because it leaves the other person without closure. The friend might be confused or feel rejected again. But the author did say they don't hold it against her and the friend was kind in her rejection. The author is struggling with their emotions and finds it painful to continue the friendship. They might need space to heal.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have been honest about their feelings and explained why they need distance. Ghosting without any communication might be seen as avoiding the conversation, even if it's hard. The friend is reaching out and trying to maintain the relationship, so ignoring her might not be the best approach. However, if the author is genuinely unable to handle the friendship and staying friends would be detrimental to their mental health, then taking a step back could be understandable.\n\nIn some cases, people need time and space after rejection, and it's not necessarily inconsiderate if they're being honest. But since they're ignoring texts and avoiding her instead of having a conversation, it might be seen as the wrong approach. The problem is the lack of communication. It's possible the author is emotionally avoiding the situation rather than addressing it directly, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not communicating their reasons clearly and instead choosing to ghost. But if the emotional state is such that they can't engage, maybe it's not entirely their fault. The key is whether they could have handled it more considerately. Ghosting is often frowned upon, but the context matters. The friend was understanding, so maybe the author's actions are not entirely wrong, but they could be improved.\n\nHmm. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) if we consider that they're acting out of emotional pain and trying to protect their own well-being. However, the method (ghosting) is typically seen as wrong. So there's a balance here. I think the answer is B, but with the caveat that they should have communicated their need for space instead of ghosting. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. The act of ghosting is usually considered wrong, but the underlying reasons might mitigate that. So maybe A or B? It's a tough call. In AITA scenarios, ghosting is often considered the wrong move, even if the person is hurt. So maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because ghosting is inconsiderate regardless of the reason. But some might argue that they have a valid reason. I need to decide based on the principles of AITA standards. Typically, ghosting is seen as the wrong choice, so the answer would be A. However, the user thinks it's B. Let me check again. The person was rejected, and they can't be friends. They are avoiding because it's painful. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship. The author's actions could be seen as self-protective but inconsiderate. In AITA, sometimes the answer is B if the person is handling their own emotions, but the ghosting is usually a red flag. So maybe A. But I'm a bit conflicted. Let me think again. If the author had told the friend that they need some space because it's too painful, that would be better. By ghosting, they're not giving the friend a chance to respect their need for space. So the author is inconsiderate in their approach, hence A. So answer A.\n"
