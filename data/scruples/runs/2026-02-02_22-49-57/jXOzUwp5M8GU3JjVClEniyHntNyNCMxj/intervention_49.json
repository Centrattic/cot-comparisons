We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been friends since spring, had mutual interests. The author developed feelings, confessed them, and got rejected. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author is avoiding her, so it's ghosting. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that their feelings haven't changed, and staying friends would be painful. They don't hate the friend, just can't see how to go back to the previous state. The friend is trying to reach out but the author is ignoring her.\n\nI need to consider if ghosting is the right move here. Ghosting is generally seen as cutting off communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. However, in cases where someone is emotionally overwhelmed after a rejection, it might be a way to protect themselves. \n\nBut there's a balance. If the friend wants to maintain the friendship, the author might be abandoning the friend without a clear reason. However, the author is honest about their inability to move past the rejection. Sometimes, taking space is necessary if the friendship isn't working anymore. \n\nThe key points: Did the author handle it inconsiderately? They didn't confront the friend about it, just disappeared. That could be seen as inconsiderate, but the alternative is a painful friendship. \n\nBut maybe the right approach would be to tell the friend they need space, even if they can't continue the friendship. Ghosting without explanation might leave the other person confused. However, the author might not have the emotional capacity to discuss it further. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they didn't communicate their decision, that's a problem. But their reasoning is valid. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the situation is understandable, even if the method is harsh. People have different ways of coping post-rejection. The friend's desire to stay friends might not align with the author's need for distance, so it's a tough spot. The author isn't being malicious, just emotionally struggling. Therefore, B seems right.\n"
