      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a friend they've known since spring, and they developed feelings for her. They confessed, got rejected, and now they're ghosting her. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author can't handle it and is avoiding her.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about handling rejection and friendship. The author is choosing to ghost instead of communicating. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person hanging without closure. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author is avoiding it. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they can't be friends anymore because their feelings haven't changed. But is it fair to ghost? Maybe they should have been honest about needing space or explaining that they can't continue the friendship. Ghosting without communication is often considered rude because it doesn't give the other person a chance to understand or adjust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with emotional pain. They might genuinely not want to be friends anymore, which is understandable. However, ending a friendship abruptly without explanation can be hurtful. The right approach would be to have a conversation, even if it's hard. So, the author is choosing the easier path by ghosting instead of being upfront. That makes them at least partially in the wrong.\n\nBut wait, is it their fault for not being able to handle the friendship anymore? The friend was rejected, and sometimes people can't maintain a friendship after unrequited feelings. In that case, maybe it's not entirely their fault. But the method of cutting off communication without explanation is where they go wrong. So the answer would be A (they're in the wrong) because of ghosting, but the reason for wanting to end the friendship is valid. The main issue is the ghosting itself. \n\nI think the consensus would be that they should have communicated their feelings about not wanting to continue the friendship. By ghosting, they're being inconsiderate. So the answer is A."
