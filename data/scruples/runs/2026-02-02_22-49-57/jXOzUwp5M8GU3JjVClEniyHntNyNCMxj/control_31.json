We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and then started ghosting the friend. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the author is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author had a friendship that turned into a romantic interest. They confessed and were turned down. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author is struggling with the emotional aftermath. Ghosting is generally seen as rude, but there might be valid reasons here.\n\nThe author mentions that their feelings haven't changed, and being friends would be painful. It's possible they're not ready to move on. However, ghosting without communication can leave the other person confused. The friend might not understand why the author is pulling away, even if they were rejected. The key points are: the author's emotional state, the friend's intentions, and the method of handling the situation.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, it's understandable to need space after a rejection. But ghosting can be hurtful. The friend might be trying to be supportive, but the author might need time. However, the author could have communicated their need for space instead of cutting off contact. That way, the friend knows it's not a rejection of the friendship. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not communicating their feelings. But if they're truly not ready to be friends, maybe they're not in the wrong. It's a tricky situation. The answer might depend on whether the ghosting is seen as self-preservation or a lack of communication.\n"
