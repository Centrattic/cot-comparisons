We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The situation is that they had a good friendship, they confessed their feelings, the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. The author now finds it painful to continue the friendship and is ignoring her texts.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the initial friendship, the confession, the rejection, and the subsequent ghosting. First, I need to consider the norms around handling romantic rejections. Generally, people are advised to respect the other person's decision, even if they're hurt. The friend wanted to stay in touch, which is common, but the author can't handle it anymore and is avoiding her.\n\nGhosting is usually considered rude because it's abrupt and doesn't allow the other person to process or respond. The author didn't communicate their need for space directly, which could leave the friend confused or hurt. Even though the author's feelings haven't changed, maintaining a friendship after a rejection can be tough, but cutting off contact entirely without explanation might be the wrong approach.\n\nBut wait, the author isn't rejecting the friendship out of malice; they're doing it because they find it painful. The friend is making efforts to reach out, so maybe the author should have communicated their feelings better instead of ghosting. If the author had explained that they need time to move on but appreciate the friendship, that might have been more considerate. \n\nSo the question is whether the author's actions are justified. The answer probably hinges on whether they had a conversation instead of just disappearing. Ghosting isn't the right move here because it's unkind to the friend. The author is in a tough spot, but the wrong lies in not communicating clearly. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
