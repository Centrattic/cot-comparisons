We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting a friend after being rejected.\n\nSo the situation is: the person had a friend since spring, they got along well. The author developed feelings, confessed, but the friend didn't reciprocate. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author is struggling because their feelings haven't changed. Now the author is ignoring texts and avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are about boundaries, communication, and mutual respect. \n\nGhosting is generally considered inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. The friend tried to maintain the relationship and approached the author, but the author is avoiding them. However, the author's reasons are valid\u2014they can't see how the friendship can continue without pain. \n\nBut is it wrong to ghost? Well, even if the author is hurt, cutting off communication without explanation can be hurtful. The friend might be confused or worried. The right approach might have been to be honest about not wanting to continue the friendship, rather than ghosting. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is genuinely unable to maintain the friendship without it being painful, it's understandable they want distance. However, the way they're doing it (ghosting) might be the issue. They could have communicated their need for space more directly instead of just disappearing. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting space, but the method of handling it (ghosting) is. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they should have communicated their feelings instead of ghosting. But maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check again. The author says they don't hold it against her and don't think negatively, but can't go back. They tried to avoid the pain by ghosting. Ghosting is usually seen as inconsiderate, so AITA would be A here.\n"
