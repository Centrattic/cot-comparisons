We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a friend they've known since spring, got close, developed feelings, confessed them, and was turned down. Now the friend wants to stay in touch, but the author is ghosting them because they can't move past their feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. The author was honest about their feelings, which is usually seen as positive. The friend was kind but not interested. The author is struggling to maintain the friendship post-rejection. The issue is whether ghosting is the wrong move here.\n\nOn one hand, ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the friend is trying to maintain a relationship. It might leave the friend confused or feeling rejected again. But on the other hand, the author is clearly stating their discomfort with continuing the friendship. Maybe they need space to heal and can't fake being friends.\n\nThe key points here are communication and respect. If the author had communicated their need for space instead of ghosting, that might be a better approach. However, the author's intention is to avoid ongoing pain, so perhaps they believe that cutting off is the only way to move on. \n\nBut is it fair to the friend? The friend might not realize that the author is avoiding them out of lingering feelings. Ghosting can be hurtful regardless of the reason. However, the author isn't being malicious; they're dealing with unrequited feelings. There's a difference between being a jerk and being a person struggling with emotions. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often values honesty and communication. The author might be advised to explain their situation instead of ghosting. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. If they don't have to stay friends, maybe they aren't in the wrong, just making a tough choice. However, the act of ghosting without explanation could be seen as inconsiderate. So the answer might depend on whether the wrongness comes from the action (ghosting) or the intent (protecting themselves).\n"
