We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted their friend after being rejected is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friend they liked, asked her out, she said no, and now they're avoiding her. The user wants to know if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person had feelings, confessed, and was rejected. Now they're struggling to maintain the friendship because their feelings haven't changed. Ghosting is usually seen as inconsiderate, but there might be valid reasons here. \n\nThe friend wants to stay in touch, but the author can't handle the pain of being close without a romantic relationship. Is that a valid reason to ghost? Well, it's a personal decision. If the author is being honest about their feelings and the reason, then maybe it's understandable. But ghosting without communication is usually frowned upon because it can hurt the other person.\n\nHowever, the author might not be able to fake being okay with the friendship. Pretending to be friends when they still have feelings could be worse in the long run. So maybe avoiding is better for both parties. But the right approach would be to have an open conversation instead of just cutting off. \n\nSo the key point is whether ghosting is the wrong approach. Even if the author has valid reasons, not communicating their decision is generally considered inconsiderate. The correct action would be to explain their feelings and set boundaries, even if they need space. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not communicating their decision instead of ghosting.\n"
