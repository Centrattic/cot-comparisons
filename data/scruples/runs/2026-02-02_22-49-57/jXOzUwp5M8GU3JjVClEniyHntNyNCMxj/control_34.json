We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that they had a friendship, developed feelings, confessed them, got rejected, and now are avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was friends with someone, then had a crush. They asked the friend out, got turned down, and now they can't be friends anymore. They're ghosting, which means cutting off contact suddenly. The friend wants to stay friends but the author can't handle it. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, in relationships, when someone is rejected, it's common for the dynamic to change. The author is struggling with their feelings not changing, which makes it hard to be friends. Ghosting is usually seen as rude because it's abrupt and doesn't give the other person closure. However, the author might be trying to protect their own feelings by cutting off contact. \n\nBut the friend is trying to maintain the friendship. The author isn't being malicious; they're just emotionally overwhelmed. However, by ghosting, they're leaving the other person confused and possibly hurt. Is that wrong? It depends on the circumstances. Some people might argue that it's better to be honest about needing space rather than ghosting. But the author might not be ready to face the friend yet. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend wants to stay friends and the author can't, maybe the right approach is to explain their need for space instead of ghosting. But if the author can't handle being friends, maybe they aren't in the wrong for needing to step back. However, the method of stepping back (ghosting) is usually considered inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) for ghosting, even if their feelings are valid. But some might say B (they aren't in the wrong) because they're dealing with rejection and can't be friends. It's a bit of a gray area. The key points are the friend's attempts to stay in contact and the author's avoidance without communication. Ghosting is typically seen as a problem, so maybe the answer is A.\n"
