We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author had a friend they knew since spring. They both shared interests and got along well. The author developed feelings but was too shy to act. Then they confessed their feelings, but the friend didn't reciprocate. She was kind but didn't feel the same. The author doesn't hold it against her, but their friendship changed. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the author is avoiding her because they can't see being friends anymore. They're ignoring texts and avoiding her.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by ghosting. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author had a genuine connection and confessed their feelings. The friend turned them down, which is a normal part of relationships. The author is struggling to maintain the friendship because their feelings haven't changed, and it's causing them pain. They're choosing to ghost instead of confronting the situation.\n\nIs ghosting the right approach here? Ghosting typically means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author isn't responding to texts or approaching the friend. The friend, on the other hand, is trying to reach out and wants to continue the friendship.\n\nNow, the author's reasoning is that they can't see how they can be friends anymore because their feelings are still there. That's understandable. Emotional pain can make it hard to maintain a friendship after romantic rejection. However, ghosting might not be the healthiest or most respectful way to handle it.\n\nIf the author truly can't be friends, the better approach might be to have an honest conversation with the friend, explaining that they need space and that they can't continue the friendship. This way, the friend isn't left confused or hurt by the sudden silence. By ignoring messages, the friend might feel rejected again or think there's something wrong with them, even though the author's issue is about unrequited feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with emotional pain. Sometimes, people can't handle the friendship after rejection, and it's a personal struggle. But the way they handle it matters. Ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person in the dark. It's better to communicate, even if it's uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong for not wanting to continue the friendship, but the method of handling it (ghosting) is questionable. They're not wrong for their feelings, but their actions could be improved by being honest and respectful, even if they can't stay friends. Therefore, while their feelings are valid, the ghosting is inconsiderate and could be seen as the wrong approach.\n"
