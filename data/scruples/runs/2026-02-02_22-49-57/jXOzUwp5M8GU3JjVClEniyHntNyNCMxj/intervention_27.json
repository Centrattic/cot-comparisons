We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The situation is that they developed feelings for a friend, confessed, and she didn't reciprocate. Now, they're ignoring her texts and avoiding her because they can't see being friends anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels that their feelings haven't changed, and they think staying friends would be painful. Ghosting is generally seen as not being considerate, but here the friend is trying to maintain the relationship. The author's reasoning is that the friendship can't go back to how it was before, which is a common sentiment after rejection.\n\nBut is it fair to ghost someone? Usually, being upfront and setting boundaries is better. However, the author's actions are driven by their emotional state. They might not want to hurt the friend by being abrupt, but ignoring is still a form of rejection. The key point is whether the author is being inconsiderate. The friend is reaching out, and the author is avoiding, which can leave the friend confused or hurt. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author truly can't handle being friends after the rejection, maybe they're doing this to protect both of their feelings. But the right action would be to explain that they need space, even if they can't be friends. Ghosting without communication can be seen as immature. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, which is possible. But maybe the answer is B, No, because the author is dealing with their own emotions. However, the ethical side is about communication and respect. Without a clear reason, ghosting is not the best approach. Since the author does have a valid reason (they can't be friends anymore), maybe B is the answer here. The person isn't in the wrong for needing to distance, even if it's not the most communication-heavy method. So, the answer is B.\n"
