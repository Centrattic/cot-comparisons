We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The person has been ignoring texts and avoiding the friend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a friend they really liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and now can't go back to being friends. They're avoiding the friend, which is ghosting. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the rejection was handled kindly, the author is struggling to move past it, and they're cutting off communication. The question is whether ghosting is justified here. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to protect their emotions. If they can't be friends without pain, maybe they need space. Ghosting might be a way to avoid prolonged hurt, even if it's abrupt. \n\nOn the other hand, ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate. The friend wants to maintain the relationship, so suddenly cutting off might be hurtful. The author could have communicated their need for space instead of disappearing. \n\nBut the author mentioned they don't hold it against the friend and it's a Pandora's box situation. Maybe they feel it's necessary for their own well-being. However, ghosting without explanation can leave the other person confused. \n\nI think it's a tough call. The author isn't malicious, but the action of ghosting might be inconsiderate. However, their intention is self-preservation. Depending on the perspective, some might say they're not in the wrong because they're acting on their emotions. Others might say they should handle it with more communication. \n\nBut in AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intention and impact. The impact of ghosting is significant, but the intention is to avoid further pain. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to protect themselves, but maybe they should have communicated. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong, and the answer is A or B, I have to decide. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because their actions, while hurtful, are a result of emotional pain and they're trying to protect themselves. Ghosting isn't good, but the root cause is understandable. However, some might argue they should have been honest instead of ghosting. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since they didn't act out of malice, maybe B is the better choice.\n"
