We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after she turned them down. The situation is that they had a friendship, developed feelings, confessed, and got rejected. Now they're avoiding her, and the friend wants to stay friends, but the author can't handle it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. The author had a friend they really liked, which is common. When you have feelings for a friend, it's a delicate situation. The author mustered the courage to ask her out, which is a brave move. The friend was nice but didn't feel the same. The author's response is to ghost them, ignoring texts and avoiding her.\n\nIs this wrong? Well, ghosting is generally frowned upon because it can be hurtful and inconsiderate. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author is struggling with their emotions. The key here is communication. Instead of cutting off contact abruptly, the author could have explained their feelings more clearly. They might need space, but ghosting without explanation can leave the other person confused and hurt, even if the author is trying to protect themselves.\n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is that being friends is now painful because their feelings haven't changed. It's understandable that they can't go back to how things were. But the right approach would be to have an open conversation about their inability to continue the friendship, rather than ghosting. Ghosting is often seen as a cowardly way to avoid confrontation, which can be more hurtful in the long run.\n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid, their method of handling the situation (ghosting) is inconsiderate. They're in the wrong for not communicating their need for space and instead disappearing without explanation. The friend deserves a clear reason to understand why the relationship is changing. The author could have been honest about their lingering feelings making it hard to be friends, which would have been more respectful.\n"
