We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting a friend after being rejected. The situation is that the author had feelings for their friend, confessed, got rejected, and now is avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"ITA\" means here. It's an AITA (Am I the Asshole) type question, so the user wants to know if their actions are justified. The author says they don't hate the friend but can't see how they can continue being friends because it's painful. They're ignoring texts and avoiding her now.\n\nHmm. So, when someone has a crush on a friend and gets rejected, it's common to feel hurt and need space. But ghosting is usually considered rude because you don't communicate. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the author is avoiding her. Is there a right or wrong here?\n\nWell, the author's feelings are valid. They might need time to process. But instead of cutting off all contact abruptly, maybe they should have communicated that they need space. Ghosting without explanation can be hurtful, even if the reason is emotional pain. The friend might not understand why they're being ignored and could feel rejected again or think they did something wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author can't handle the friendship anymore and it's genuinely painful, they might feel they have no choice. But the right approach would be to explain that they need some time to adjust, rather than just disappearing. That way, the friend isn't left confused. \n\nSo, the author's actions are understandable emotionally, but socially, they're in the wrong because they didn't communicate. The better choice would be to be honest about needing distance but to do it respectfully. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
