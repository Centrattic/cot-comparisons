We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting a friend after being turned down for a date.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The person had a close friendship since spring, developed feelings, confessed them, and was rejected. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author is avoiding her because it's painful. They're ghosting her now.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my take. I need to decide between A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nLet me break it down. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person hanging. However, the author is dealing with unrequited feelings, which can be really tough. They might not be ready to maintain the friendship because it's causing emotional pain. The friend is trying to reach out, but the author isn't responding.\n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about their feelings and choosing to step back to protect themselves. They're not pretending to be something they're not. On the other hand, ghosting can be hurtful because the friend isn't getting closure. The author could have communicated better, maybe set boundaries upfront instead of just cutting off contact. \n\nBut the key point is that the author's decision to ghost is due to emotional pain, not out of malice. They didn't want to be friends anymore, but didn't explain why. The friend is confused and might feel rejected again. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on how the actions affect others. Ghosting is usually frowned upon, but if the person's actions are a result of their own emotional state and they're not intentionally hurting someone, maybe it's more nuanced. The author might not be in the wrong because they can't force themselves to be friends if it's painful, but they could be wrong for not communicating their decision properly.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the wrong is about the act of ghosting itself or the underlying reasons. If the author is wrong for not communicating, then maybe A. But if their reasons are valid, then B. However, in most cases, ghosting is considered inconsiderate regardless of the reason, so maybe A. But some might argue that the author isn't obligated to stay in a friendship that's causing them pain. \n\nHmm. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they're being honest about their inability to continue the friendship. The wrong would be more if they were pretending to be friends or being cruel. Ghosting is inconsiderate, but in this case, it's about emotional conflict. Maybe the answer is B.\n"
