      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe user is asking whether the author (AITA) is at fault for ghosting a friend after she rejected them. They were friends since spring, had similar interests, and the author developed feelings but didn't act on them until later. When they confessed, the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. The author now finds it hard to be friends, so they've started ignoring her texts and avoiding her. The friend wants to keep the friendship going, but the author can't see how that would work without pain.\n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of ghosting. Ghosting usually means suddenly cutting off all communication without explanation. In this case, the author is ignoring texts and avoiding the friend. The friend wants to continue the relationship, but the author is hurt and doesn't want to be in a friendship where they have unrequited feelings. \n\nIs the author justified in their actions? Well, after a romantic rejection, it's natural for some people to need space. The author mentions they don't hold it against the friend and aren't angry, just that their feelings haven't changed. If they can't be friends without it being painful, maybe they need distance to heal. However, ghosting without communication can leave the other person confused or hurt. The friend might not understand why they're being ignored, even if the author is hurt. \n\nBut the author isn't being vindictive; they just can't handle the friendship anymore. The key here is whether the author is being inconsiderate by not explaining their actions. If they had communicated that they need space, maybe it's more understandable. Ghosting without an explanation can be seen as inconsiderate, even if the feelings are valid. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not want to force a friendship that's not healthy for them. If being around the friend is painful, maybe it's better to distance themselves. The question is whether they have the right to walk away, even if it's the friend who initiated the rejection. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're making a hard decision for their own well-being. However, the method of ghosting without explanation might be seen as abrupt. But in the context of unrequited feelings and wanting to avoid ongoing pain, their actions are understandable. The friend might need to accept that the author can't continue the friendship, even if it's not the author's fault. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their emotional health, even if the approach could be improved by communication rather than ghosting. But since the user is asking if they're in the wrong, and the author's intentions aren't malicious, it's a no.\n"
