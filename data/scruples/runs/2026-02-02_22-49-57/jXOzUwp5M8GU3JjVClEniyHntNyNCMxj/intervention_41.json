We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a close friendship with someone since spring, shared interests, and developed feelings. They confessed their feelings but were turned down kindly. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author is struggling with the dynamic now. They're ignoring texts and avoiding the friend because they can't get over the unrequited feelings.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know if that's accurate. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nSo, what are the factors here? Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. However, the author is dealing with emotional pain. They might not be ready to maintain the friendship. The friend is trying to stay in touch, but the author is avoiding it. \n\nIs it wrong to ghost? Well, communication is key in relationships, even friendships. If the author is emotionally overwhelmed, maybe they should have communicated that instead of cutting off. But on the other hand, sometimes people need space to heal. The key point is whether the author's actions were respectful. Ghosting without explanation can be hurtful, even if they have their reasons. However, the friend might not understand why the author is pulling away without being told. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that they can't maintain the friendship because it's painful. That's a valid emotion. However, the friend might feel rejected again by being ghosted. Maybe the right approach is to explain the situation, even if they don't want to be friends anymore. That way, the friend isn't left in the dark.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, they're dealing with their feelings and might not be ready to continue the friendship. On the other hand, ghosting is abrupt and can be seen as inconsiderate. However, in some cases, taking a step back is necessary. But the author could have at least explained their need for space. Since they didn't, maybe that's where the wrong is. Alternatively, if they tried to explain but the friend kept pushing, maybe it's justified. But the post doesn't mention that the author tried to explain, just that they ignored texts and avoided. So perhaps the author is in the wrong for not communicating their reasons, even if they're hurting. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is often about communication and respect. Ghosting is usually frowned upon because it's a lack of communication. So the answer might be A, but maybe the context makes it B. The author's reasoning is understandable, but the action (ghosting) is the issue. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not explaining their situation, even if their feelings are valid.\n"
