We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they had a good friendship since spring. They developed feelings but were too scared to act. Then they confessed, and the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. The person now feels they can't be friends anymore and has been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author can't see how that would work without pain.\n\nSo the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to think about the social norms here. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate. Even if someone is hurt, cutting off suddenly without explanation can be hurtful. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author is avoiding them. \n\nBut the author's feelings haven't changed, and they can't go back to how things were. Maybe they need space. However, ghosting is often considered rude. The right approach might be to have an honest conversation about needing space, rather than just disappearing. So the author might be in the wrong for not communicating and just ghosting, even if their feelings are valid. On the other hand, if they genuinely can't handle the friendship anymore, maybe it's understandable but still not the best way to handle it. So maybe the answer is A, but I need to decide if it's in the wrong. Since ghosting is typically seen as wrong, even if the person is hurt, the answer might be A. But some might say B because they have a legitimate reason. Hmm.\n"
