There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe person has a friend they've known since spring. They developed feelings for this friend but were too scared to act. They finally confessed their feelings and asked her out. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now, the author is ignoring her texts and avoiding her because they can't see being friends anymore. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author is finding it painful. \n\nFirst, I should consider the main points. The author asked the friend out, got rejected, and is now ghosting them. The question is whether this is wrong.\n\nGhosting is generally seen as cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. In this case, the author is avoiding the friend because they can't handle the emotional pain of not being able to be in a romantic relationship. The friend, on the other hand, is trying to maintain the friendship. \n\nFrom a social perspective, there's a lot that can be said here. The author might be protecting their own feelings, but they didn't explain their reasoning to the friend. AITA (Am I the Asshole) often looks at whether someone's actions were considerate, even if they had their own reasons. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. They might not be in the wrong because they're dealing with their emotions, but they could be expected to communicate their feelings to the friend instead of just ghosting. The friend was clear they wanted to stay friends, so the author could have at least explained that they need space or that a friendship isn't possible for them, even if the friend is okay with it. \n\nIf the author just cuts off communication without telling the friend, that's inconsiderate. The friend might be left wondering what they did wrong. The author might be right in thinking that being friends is painful, but the way they handle it matters. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they didn't communicate their feelings or the reasons for ghosting, then yes, they might be. But if they're just struggling emotionally and couldn't handle it, maybe not. However, the standard in these situations usually leans towards communication being key. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't explain their actions to the friend, leading to a lack of communication and potentially leaving the friend confused or hurt.\n"
