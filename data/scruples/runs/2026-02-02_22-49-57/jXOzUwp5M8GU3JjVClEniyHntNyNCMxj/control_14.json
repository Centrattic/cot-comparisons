      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong after ghosting their friend. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the person had a friendship with someone they've known since spring. They developed feelings, confessed, and got rejected. Now they're avoiding the friend because they can't see being friends anymore. The friend is trying to stay in touch, but the author is ghosting them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are that the friendship existed first, then the author confessed feelings, got rejected, and now is avoiding the friend. The author says they can't go back to how things were, so they're cutting off the friend. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, it's common for people to feel conflicted after a rejection. The author might be struggling with the friendship now that there's unrequited feelings involved. The problem is that the friend still wants to maintain the friendship, but the author isn't ready. \n\nIs the author wrong for ghosting? Well, ghosting usually refers to cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. However, in this case, the author's reasoning is that maintaining the friendship is painful because their feelings haven't changed. The friend is making efforts to stay in touch, but the author is avoiding it. \n\nSome might argue that the author should give the friendship a chance to adjust. Maybe the feelings could diminish over time, or the friendship could evolve. But others might say that it's the author's right to protect their own emotional well-being. \n\nI should think about the intent here. The author isn't being malicious; they're dealing with hurt feelings. They might not be in the wrong because they're prioritizing their mental health. However, the abruptness of ghosting without a clear explanation could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut in the scenario, the author mentions they're avoiding texts and approach. So they're not just ending the friendship suddenly but are gradually pulling away. The friend is trying to reach out, but the author isn't responding. \n\nThe question is whether it's wrong to ghost. If the author can't be in the friendship without pain, maybe it's understandable. However, being a good friend might require some communication rather than just disappearing. Maybe the right approach is to explain the situation rather than ghost. \n\nBut the author might not want to confront the friend again, leading to ghosting. So they're choosing self-preservation. In some cases, that's acceptable. However, the act of ghosting can be hurtful even if it's for a good reason. But since the friend was rejected, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong here.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is dealing with unrequited feelings and is trying to protect their emotional state. But there's a nuance here. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on relationships and friendships. However, in general, if the author can't maintain the friendship without pain, it's a valid reason to step back, even if it's not the most ideal situation. Hence, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
