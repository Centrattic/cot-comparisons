We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that they had a good friendship, the author developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now the friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author tried to be honest about their feelings, which is generally a good approach. The friend was nice about the rejection, but the author is finding it hard to maintain the friendship. The author is choosing to avoid the friend, which is ghosting. \n\nGhosting is usually seen negatively because it's abrupt and doesn't give the other person closure. However, in this case, the author is struggling with continued feelings and the pain of maintaining a friendship after rejection. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the author feels it's too painful. \n\nIs the author wrong for doing this? Well, being honest is good, but ghosting without communication might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author might be in emotional pain and not ready to face the friendship. There's a middle ground, like explaining that they need space but not cutting off completely. \n\nBut the situation is that the author is avoiding texts and approach, which could leave the friend confused. The right thing would be to communicate their need for space, but if they can't, then maybe their actions are understandable. However, ghosting is often frowned upon. \n\nIt's a tricky situation. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're dealing with their emotions, but the method of handling it (ghosting) is usually considered wrong. So the answer might depend on whether the lack of communication is worse than the emotional avoidance. I think the consensus might be that they are in the wrong for not communicating, even if their feelings are real. So answer A (Yes) might be correct. But I'm a bit torn because the emotional struggle is real. Alternatively, some might say they deserve understanding and that the author is not in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
