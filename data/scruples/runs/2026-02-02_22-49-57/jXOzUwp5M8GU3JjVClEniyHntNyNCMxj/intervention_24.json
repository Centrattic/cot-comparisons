We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The scenario is that they had a friendship, developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now are avoiding the friend. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from different angles. The author had a close friendship, developed romantic feelings, and took the risk to confess. The friend was kind but didn't reciprocate. The author is now struggling to maintain the friendship because it's painful for them. They're choosing to ghost rather than confront the situation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person hanging without closure. The friend wants to continue the relationship, but the author is avoiding communication. The author's reasoning is that they can't be friends anymore because their feelings haven't changed. However, by not communicating, they're not giving the friend a chance to understand or adjust. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with emotional pain and might feel that cutting off is the only way to protect themselves. But is that their responsibility? Maybe a better approach would be to have an honest conversation, explain their feelings, and set boundaries. Ghosting skips that step, which could be inconsiderate even if the author's intentions are to protect their own emotions.\n\nSo, while the author's actions are understandable from an emotional standpoint, the act of ghosting without communication is typically seen as the wrong approach. The right thing would be to be upfront, even if it's uncomfortable. Therefore, the answer might be A (they're in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their decision properly. But I should also consider if there's a middle ground where the author's actions are justified. However, since the friend is trying to reach out and the author is ignoring, that's where the issue lies. The author's choice to avoid rather than communicate might be the mistake.\n"
