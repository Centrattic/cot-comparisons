We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted their friend after being rejected is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friendship, got feelings for the friend, confessed, and got rejected. Now they're avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The person who ghosted says they can't be friends anymore because it's painful. They mention that the friendship can't go back to how it was. On the other hand, the friend wants to continue the friendship and keeps trying to reach out.\n\nIs it wrong to ghost someone after rejection? Well, ghosting is generally seen as cutting off communication suddenly without explanation, which can be hurtful. But in this case, the person was rejected, which might make them feel vulnerable. They might need space to process their emotions. However, the friend is trying to maintain the friendship, so ignoring them could be seen as not respecting their feelings.\n\nBut also, the person has a right to their emotional well-being. If being around the friend is painful, they might need to step back. The key here is communication. Instead of ghosting, maybe they should have explained their feelings of needing space, which could be more respectful. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Ghosting is usually frowned upon, but the context matters. Since the rejection was mutual and the person is struggling with their emotions, maybe they're not entirely wrong. However, the friend's desire to continue the friendship should be considered. So the answer might be B, they're not in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
