We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they had a friend since spring, they really liked her, but didn't act on their feelings until they confessed. She turned them down but was nice about it. Now the author is ghosting her, ignoring texts and avoiding her because they can't see being friends anymore. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author had a friendship that they felt comfortable enough to confess their feelings. Even though it was rejected, they still had feelings, and the friend wants to maintain the friendship. The author is struggling with the idea of remaining friends because it's painful for them. \n\nNow, is the author wrong for ghosting? Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. The friend is trying to reach out and maintain the friendship, but the author is avoiding it. The author's reasoning is that they can't be friends anymore without it being painful. But is that a valid reason to ghost? Maybe they should have communicated their feelings more directly. Instead of ignoring her, maybe they should have told her that they can't be friends anymore and needed space. That would be more respectful. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be dealing with emotional pain, and it's hard to be around someone they have feelings for after rejection. They might need time to process. However, cutting off communication without explanation is usually seen as inconsiderate. The friend is trying to salvage the relationship, but the author's actions are making it worse. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, ideally, the author should have communicated their need for space instead of ghosting. That would have been more responsible. Ghosting can hurt the other person because they don't know why they're being ignored. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to be friends anymore, but the way they're handling it (ghosting) is the issue. So the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because of the ghosting, even if the feelings are valid. But maybe B because their actions are a result of genuine emotional pain. Hmm. \n\nBut generally, people are expected to communicate their needs, even if it's hard. Ghosting is often considered wrong regardless of the reason. So the answer is A.\n"
