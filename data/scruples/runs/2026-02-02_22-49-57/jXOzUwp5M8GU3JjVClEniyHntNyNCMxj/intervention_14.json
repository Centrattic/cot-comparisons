We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. \n\nFirst, the friend was someone they've known since spring, and they had a good relationship with shared interests. The author developed feelings, confessed them, and was rejected. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the author is avoiding her to avoid the pain of an awkward friendship.\n\nFrom what I know about relationships and social norms, it's common for people to feel hurt after a romantic rejection. If maintaining a friendship would be emotionally difficult, it's understandable they might distance themselves. The author isn't being cruel; they're trying to protect their own feelings. \n\nGhosting can be seen as inconsiderate, but in this case, the author isn't hiding malicious intent. They're honest about their feelings not changing and the difficulty of being friends. The friend, on the other hand, might not realize the ongoing pain, but that's part of the rejection process. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being. So, the answer is B.\n"
