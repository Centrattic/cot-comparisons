There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that the friend has known the person since spring, they were close and shared interests. The author developed feelings, confessed, but the friend didn't reciprocate. Now, the friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author is avoiding her.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author approached the friend and expressed their feelings. The friend was kind but turned them down. The author then decided to ghost her because their feelings haven't changed and they find the friendship painful. The friend is still trying to reach out. \n\nSo, the core issue here is whether it's wrong to ghost someone after being rejected. Ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate because it stops communication abruptly without explanation. However, the author's reasoning is that maintaining the friendship is painful for them. \n\nI should consider both perspectives. The author's perspective is that they can't handle the emotional pain of being around someone they still have feelings for after rejection. The friend's perspective is that she was respectful in her rejection and is trying to keep the friendship, but the author is cutting her off without communication.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In the AITA framework, the key is to assess if the author's actions were unreasonable. Ghosting can be seen as avoiding a difficult conversation, which might be hurtful to the friend. However, if the author is genuinely unable to handle the friendship anymore, maybe their actions are a result of emotional pain rather than malice.\n\nBut the problem is that the author didn't communicate their decision. They just stopped responding. Even if it's painful, being honest with the friend about needing space or the inability to continue the friendship might have been more considerate. Ghosting can leave the friend confused and feeling rejected again, which isn't fair to her.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't holding it against the friend, which shows they're not acting out of spite. They're trying to protect their own feelings. However, in healthy relationships, communication is important. If the author can't be friends but doesn't tell the friend, that's the issue. The friend deserves to know why the communication is stopping, especially since she's still trying to reach out.\n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid, the way they're handling the situation by ghosting is likely the problem. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their need for distance, instead just ignoring texts. But I should also consider if there's a valid reason for their actions. Since they're not being spiteful but are still hurting, maybe the answer is B (No), because the situation is complicated. But in AITA, the community often values communication and respect. Ghosting isn't respectful here because the friend is still trying to maintain the relationship. The author should have had a conversation instead of cutting off. So probably A is the answer.\n"
