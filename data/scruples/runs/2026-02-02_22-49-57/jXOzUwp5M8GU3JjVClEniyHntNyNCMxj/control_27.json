We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting a friend after being rejected.\n\nSo, the person had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got turned down, and then started ignoring the friend to avoid pain. The friend still wants to maintain the friendship. The user is asking if the author is at fault here.\n\nHmm. First, I need to understand the context. Ghosting generally refers to cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author is avoiding the friend after being rejected, which is a common reaction. But is it wrong?\n\nWell, the friend was trying to continue the relationship, but the author can't handle the pain of being around them. The key points here are the friend's desire to remain friends versus the author's emotional state. \n\nI think it's important to consider both sides. The friend was clear they wanted to stay in touch, which might not be fair to them if the author is ghosting. But the author is also dealing with their emotions and might not be in a place to handle the friendship without pain. \n\nIs there a better way to handle this? Probably yes. The author could have communicated their feelings and the need for space without ghosting. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for doing so. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate. The friend is reaching out, and ignoring them might make the friend feel confused or hurt. However, the author's actions stem from personal emotional struggle, not malice. So it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nBut the user is asking for a clear answer, A or B. If the author is being inconsiderate without a valid reason, then A. But if their actions are a result of genuine emotional pain and they're not acting out of spite, maybe B. \n\nI think the answer might be B, not in the wrong, because they're dealing with their feelings and it's understandable they can't continue the friendship. But some might argue that ghosting is never good. However, the author isn't doing it to hurt but to protect themselves. So B makes sense.\n"
