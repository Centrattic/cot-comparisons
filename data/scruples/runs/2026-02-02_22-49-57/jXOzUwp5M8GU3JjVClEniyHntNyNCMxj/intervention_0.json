We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about ghosting a friend after being turned down. The author says they confessed their feelings, the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate, and now the author is ignoring her texts and avoiding her because they can't see going back to being friends.\n\nFirst, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person in limbo without closure. The friend wants to maintain the friendship, but the author finds it painful to continue. \n\nThe key here is the emotional impact. The author might be protecting themselves from ongoing discomfort, but it's still abrupt and doesn't communicate clearly. However, if the friendship is genuinely too painful, maybe the author is prioritizing their own well-being. On the other hand, the friend might have a right to know why the connection is being severed. \n\nI should consider cultural norms and general advice on relationships. Experts often recommend being honest and setting boundaries rather than ghosting. But the author's reasoning is about the friendship changing irreversibly. Maybe they're not in the wrong because the situation is tough, but still, ghosting isn't ideal. However, the user is asking if they are \"in the wrong,\" which is a moral judgment. \n\nThe friend was kind in turning them down, and the author might be struggling with the adjustment. But avoiding communication entirely without explanation could be seen as wrong, even if it's for personal reasons. So the answer might be A (yes) because ghosting isn't respectful, but the user's perspective is that it's not wrong. Need to check if there's a justification. \n\nBut the author's feelings haven't changed, and they can't be friends. Maybe they need time to heal, but ghosting isn't the solution. However, if the friendship is no longer working, maybe it's not their fault. The question is whether they are morally at fault. \n\nI think the right approach is to be upfront about needing space, even if it means ending the friendship. Ghosting without communication is inconsiderate. So the answer would be A. But the user's reasoning says it's not wrong. Hmm. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong for their feelings but is in the wrong for ghosting. So, the answer would be A.\n"
