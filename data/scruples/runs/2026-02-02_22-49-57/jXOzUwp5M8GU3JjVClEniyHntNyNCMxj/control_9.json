We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they ghosted their friend after being turned down when they asked her out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The user was friends with someone since spring, they shared interests, and they developed feelings but were too scared to act. Then they confessed their feelings, the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. The user doesn't hate the friend but feels like they can't go back to being friends. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship by texting and approaching, but the user is ignoring her and avoiding her. The user is ghosting them.\n\nNow, is the user in the wrong? Well, when someone is rejected in a romantic context, it's common to feel hurt and maybe want to distance themselves. But ghosting\u2014without explaining\u2014is usually seen as inconsiderate. The user says their feelings haven't changed and that being friends would be painful. They might be protecting themselves, but they didn't communicate this to the friend. The friend is trying to reach out, which shows she wants to maintain the friendship. Ghosting could leave the friend confused and hurt, even if the user is the one who was rejected.\n\nOn the other hand, the user is dealing with emotional pain. It's valid to need space to process feelings. However, the right thing to do would have been to be honest with the friend, explain that they need time or space, even if they can't continue the friendship. Ghosting is a form of avoidance and doesn't give closure. The user is avoiding the pain, but it's not fair to the friend to be left in the dark. So, while the user's feelings are valid, their actions (ghosting) are inconsiderate. They are in the wrong for not communicating their need for space and for disappearing instead of being upfront.\n"
