We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had a close friendship, developed feelings, confessed them, and the friend rejected them. Now the author is avoiding the friend, ignoring texts. The friend still wants to maintain the friendship, but the author can't handle it because they still have feelings.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's break it down. The friend didn't do anything wrong; they were honest and tried to continue the friendship. The author's issue is their own unresolved feelings. Ghosting might be hurtful, but it's understandable if they can't move past it. However, the friend is reaching out, and cutting off communication without explanation could be seen as inconsiderate. On the other hand, the author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" because they're dealing with their emotions. It's a tough spot, but maybe not a clear-cut case of wrong. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, but I need to make sure there's no obligation to stay friends. Since the author's pain is real and they can't maintain the friendship, it's their choice, though it's better to communicate honestly. So B.\n"
