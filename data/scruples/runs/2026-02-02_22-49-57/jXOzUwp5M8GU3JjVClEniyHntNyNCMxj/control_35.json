I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone who ghosted their friend after being turned down. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author had a close friendship with someone they've known since spring. They developed feelings but didn't act on them until they confessed. The friend was kind but didn't reciprocate the feelings. Now, the author is avoiding the friend, ignoring texts, and the friend still wants to continue the friendship. The author feels they can't go back to being friends and are ghosting them.\n\nSo, the main question is whether ghosting here is wrong. Let me think about the key points. The author is emotionally hurt and finds it hard to maintain the friendship. They feel that staying friends would be painful. The friend is trying to reach out, but the author is pulling away.\n\nI know that in relationships, whether romantic or platonic, honesty and communication are usually important. Ghosting, which is cutting off communication without explanation, can be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the author is hurt, not responding might leave the friend confused or worried. The author could have explained their need for space or that they can't continue the friendship, which would be more respectful.\n\nHowever, the author isn't trying to be mean. They genuinely can't handle the situation and want to avoid ongoing pain. But is that a valid reason to ghost? People handle rejection differently. Some might need time, but cutting off completely might not be the healthiest approach for either person. The friend might appreciate an honest conversation, even if it's uncomfortable.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're not in the wrong for not wanting to continue the friendship, but ghosting is a poor way to handle it. They should have communicated their feelings instead of disappearing. Therefore, the answer might be A, but it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't in the wrong for their feelings but for how they handled the situation. So according to the options, the answer would be A (yes, in the wrong) because of the lack of communication.\n"
