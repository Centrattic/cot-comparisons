      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting a friend after being rejected. The situation is that the author had a good friendship since spring, developed feelings, confessed, but the friend didn't reciprocate. The author feels they can't go back to being just friends, so they've been ignoring texts and avoiding her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that their feelings haven't changed, and maintaining the friendship would be painful. They might be struggling with emotional pain and trying to protect themselves. Ghosting, however, is generally seen as abrupt and inconsiderate. The friend might feel hurt or confused because the author didn't explain their actions.\n\nBut the author is also in a tough spot. After confessing, the dynamic might have changed, and if they can't move past the rejection, it's understandable they'd want space. The key points here are intent and communication. If the author's intention was to avoid further emotional distress and they haven't responded because they don't think it's fair to both parties to continue the friendship without being honest, maybe they're not entirely wrong. However, the right approach would usually involve some communication to explain the decision, rather than ghosting. \n\nGhosting can be seen as a lack of respect for the friend's attempts to stay in touch. The friend might appreciate a straightforward conversation even if it's hard. The author might be doing this to prevent hurt, but it's possible they're also causing hurt by being silent. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, many would argue that while the author's feelings are valid, ghosting isn't the best way to handle it. The author is not in the wrong in the sense that they have a right to their feelings and need space, but maybe they did wrong by not communicating their reasons. However, the question is whether they are \"in the wrong\" period. \n\nSome might say it's okay to step back if the friendship is too painful, especially if they can't be emotionally available. Others might say that being upfront is better. Since the author is avoiding the pain and not acting out of malice, perhaps they are not in the wrong. But the act of ghosting without explanation is often frowned upon. \n\nBut the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to balance between the emotional state of the author and the friend's perspective. If the author's actions are causing the friend distress, maybe they are in the wrong. However, the author might not have a choice but to distance themselves. \n\nThe answer might be B (No), because the author's reasons are genuine, and they are not intentionally being cruel. But there's a nuance. The act of ghosting is typically considered poor form because it leaves the other person in the dark. However, if the author can't handle the friendship anymore and it's too painful, maybe they are justified. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing ghosting over a conversation. \n\nIn some cases, people do it to avoid hurting the other person's feelings, but it's still considered wrong because it's not respectful. However, since the author already tried to confess and the friend wants to continue, maybe they should have at least communicated their need for space. \n\nI think the correct answer is B (No), but with the caveat that better communication would have been better. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given their reasoning, the answer is B.\n"
