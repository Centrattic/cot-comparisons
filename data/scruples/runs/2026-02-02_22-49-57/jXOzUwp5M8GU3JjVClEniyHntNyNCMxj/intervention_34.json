We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that the author had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and now is avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they developed feelings, confessed, were rejected, and now find it hard to be friends. They're ghosting because they don't want to be in pain. On the other hand, the friend wants to stay friends and is reaching out, so the ghosting could be seen as hurtful or dismissive.\n\nIs it wrong to ghost? Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. However, the author's feelings are valid too. If they can't be friends without being in pain, maybe they need space. But the author could have communicated this instead of just cutting off contact. Maybe a conversation to explain their need for distance would be better than ghosting. \n\nThe key points: the friend was nice in the rejection, the author is ignoring texts and avoiding contact. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Some might say yes because ghosting is unkind, others might say no because the author's emotional well-being is a valid reason. But the friend is trying to maintain the friendship, so not responding could make things worse. The right approach might be to be honest about needing space rather than ghosting. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not communicating and just disappearing. But I'm not sure. It's a tough call. The answer could depend on cultural norms or personal opinions on ghosting. In many cases, ghosting is frowned upon regardless of the reason, so the author might be in the wrong even if their feelings are understandable.\n"
