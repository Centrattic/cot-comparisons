We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting a friend after being turned down. The author had a friendship with someone since spring, developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now is avoiding the friend. They think they're not in the wrong but want to know if I agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a friendship that turned into a romantic interest. Confessed feelings and got rejected. Now, they're struggling to maintain the friendship because it's painful. Ghosting is the result. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect, communication, and emotional impact. Ghosting usually lacks communication, which can be hurtful. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author is avoiding. \n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is valid\u2014continuing the friendship might be painful if feelings haven't changed. They're not holding a grudge, just finding it impossible to move forward. \n\nBut is ghosting the right approach? It's abrupt and doesn't allow the friend to understand the situation. Maybe the author should have communicated their feelings instead. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author is protecting their own well-being. On the other hand, the friend might feel rejected again and confused. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they're dealing with emotional pain and trying to protect themselves. However, the method could have been better. But the question is about being in the wrong, not the best approach. So, the answer might be B (No).\n"
