We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted their friend after being rejected is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a good friendship, developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now can't maintain the friendship because it's too painful, so they ghosted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The person had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, which is a big step. The friend didn't reciprocate, which can be tough. Now the person is avoiding the friend after the rejection. The question is if ghosting is wrong here.\n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it's abrupt and doesn't allow the other person to respond. But in this case, the person is struggling with lingering feelings. They can't go back to being friends, so they're avoiding communication. The friend, on the other hand, seems to want to maintain the friendship and is reaching out. \n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The person who ghosted didn't respond, which might leave the friend confused or hurt, not understanding why the sudden distance. Even though the person has valid reasons for feeling hurt and unable to continue the friendship, cutting off communication without explanation can be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the person has the right to distance themselves if they're not comfortable continuing the friendship. It's a personal choice, but the lack of communication is the issue. The right approach would have been to explain their feelings and set boundaries respectfully, even if it's hard. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the friend wanted to stay in touch and the author didn't communicate their reasons, then yes, the author is being inconsiderate. But if the author is genuinely unable to handle the friendship and can't maintain a friendship without pain, maybe it's a difficult situation. But ghosting is still not the best approach. They should have communicated, even if it's uncomfortable. Therefore, the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their reasons and left the friend hanging.\n"
