      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a friend they've known since spring. They developed feelings for her but didn't act on them until they confessed. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now, the author is ghosting her, ignoring texts, and avoiding her, saying that being friends is too painful. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author can't see how that would work.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. When someone confesses their feelings and is rejected, it's natural for the emotional dynamic to change. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author feels it's no longer possible without pain.\n\nThe question is whether ghosting is wrong. Ghosting usually refers to suddenly cutting off all communication without explanation. The author is avoiding the friend and not responding to texts. The friend is reaching out, and the author is choosing to ignore her. \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that continuing the friendship is too difficult, and they have the right to prioritize their emotional well-being. It's understandable that they can't go back to the same friendship after developing unrequited feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate. The friend might appreciate a clear explanation rather than being ignored. Being upfront about needing space or explaining that the friendship has changed could be more respectful. However, the author might not feel ready to have that conversation, especially if it's painful.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They're not malicious; they're struggling with their emotions. However, ignoring someone after a rejection might not be the most respectful approach. The author could be advised to communicate their feelings more directly, even if it's hard. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" maybe not. They're making a choice based on their emotional state, even if it's not the kindest approach. So perhaps answer B (No), but with the caveat that communication could be better. The main issue is whether they're at fault, and given their intentions, maybe they're not entirely in the wrong.\n"
