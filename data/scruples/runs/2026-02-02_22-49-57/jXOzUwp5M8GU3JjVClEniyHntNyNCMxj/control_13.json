We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after ghosting their friend following a rejection.\n\nSo the situation: They had a friendship since spring, got close, shared interests. The author developed feelings, confessed them, the friend was kind but didn't reciprocate. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author is hurt and can't see how they can remain friends. The author has been ignoring texts and avoiding the friend, hence the ghosting.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the author's actions are justified. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. But in this case, the author is hurt and feels that being friends is painful because feelings haven't changed. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author can't move past the rejection.\n\nIs the author wrong? Let me think. The friend was clear about not wanting a romantic relationship but wanted to continue friendship. The author is struggling to accept that and is choosing to distance themselves. \n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. However, the author is emotionally hurt and might need space. But instead of ignoring, perhaps a more honest conversation would have been better. The author could explain that they need time or can't continue the friendship, but doing so without communication is unkind. \n\nThe friend is trying to reach out, and the author is avoiding it. That might be inconsiderate. The author's feelings are valid, but the way they're handling the situation could be seen as wrong because it's not respecting the friend's desire to remain in touch, even if the author can't reciprocate. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because ghosting isn't the healthiest or most respectful response. However, some might argue that the author is justified in protecting their feelings. But generally, ignoring someone and not communicating is seen as the asshole move here. The author could have been honest about needing space or not wanting to continue being friends, which is better than ghosting. So the answer is A.\n"
