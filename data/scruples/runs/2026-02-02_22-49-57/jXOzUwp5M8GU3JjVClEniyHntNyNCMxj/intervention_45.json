We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The situation is that they've been friends since spring, got along well, but the author developed feelings and asked the friend out. She was nice but didn't reciprocate, and now the author is avoiding her texts and interactions because being friends is too painful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if ghosting is the right approach here. Ghosting usually refers to cutting off communication abruptly without explanation, which can be hurtful. But in this case, the friend is trying to maintain the friendship after the rejection, and the author is struggling to stay friends. The author might be feeling that pretending to be okay with the friendship is causing them emotional pain, so they're avoiding interaction. \n\nBut is that acceptable? On one hand, the author has the right to protect their feelings and take time to process. However, ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate because the friend is reaching out and trying to keep things normal. The author could have set boundaries or communicated their need for space instead of disappearing completely. \n\nThe key points are the friend's attempts to stay in touch versus the author's emotional state. The author's reasoning is that they can't go back to how things were, so they're avoiding the friendship to prevent pain. But maybe the friend is unaware of the extent of the problem. If the author doesn't explain, the friend might feel confused or rejected again, which isn't fair. \n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid, the way they're handling it\u2014ghosting without communication\u2014might be wrong. The right approach would be to have an honest conversation about their feelings and the need for some distance, rather than just ignoring messages. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they're not being transparent, even if their reasons are understandable.\n"
