We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a friend they liked and confessed their feelings, but the friend turned them down. Now, the friend wants to stay friends and reach out, but the author is ghosting them because they can't see being friends anymore. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was honest about their feelings, which is good. The friend was kind in declining, which is also positive. The problem arises after the rejection. The author is ghosting despite the friend wanting to maintain the friendship. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to feel hurt and might not want to be around their friend anymore to avoid pain. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate, though. It's abrupt and doesn't allow for closure. The friend is making an effort to stay in touch, so ignoring them could be seen as rejecting their attempt at maintaining a relationship. \n\nHowever, the author might genuinely believe that continuing the friendship isn't possible without pain. People process rejection differently. If the author isn't ready to be friends and needs time, maybe communicating that instead of ghosting would be better. But the act of ghosting itself is often viewed as the asshole move because it's unkind. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether their actions were considerate. Ghosting without explanation is typically considered wrong. They could have been honest about needing space or time to adjust, but cutting off communication entirely without any response might be the issue here. Therefore, the answer might be A. But some might argue that the author isn't obligated to stay friends and has the right to walk away, so B could also be a perspective. \n\nBut in AITA scenarios, ghosting even after rejection is usually frowned upon. The friend is trying to keep the friendship, and the author's response is to ghost, which is seen as the asshole move. So the answer is likely A.\n"
