We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that they had a friendship, developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now are avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of ghosting. Ghosting is generally seen as cutting off communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. However, the author mentions that they're avoiding the friend because they can't be friends anymore due to lingering feelings. The friend wants to maintain the relationship, but the author finds it painful to continue. \n\nOn one hand, the author could be in the wrong because ghosting is usually considered inconsiderate. The friend might want closure or an explanation. But on the other hand, the author is struggling with their emotions and might be trying to protect both of them by not prolonging a friendship that's causing pain. \n\nThe key points are intent and communication. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to avoid ongoing emotional distress. However, ignoring texts and avoiding someone without explaining could leave the friend confused or hurt. A better approach might be to have an honest conversation about needing space, even if it's uncomfortable. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're not being hostile but are instead prioritizing their own well-being, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, the lack of communication is a flaw. But maybe that's a matter of personal choice rather than being \"wrong.\" So the answer is B.\n"
