We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The friend turned them down, and now they're ignoring her texts and avoiding her because they can't see going back to being just friends. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what \"ghosting\" means. It's when someone suddenly cuts off all communication without explanation. In this case, the person asked the friend out, got rejected, and then started ignoring her. They feel that being friends is now impossible because their feelings haven't changed, and being around her is painful.\n\nNow, considering the situation. When you confess feelings and get rejected, it's natural to feel hurt. The person is choosing to ghost instead of communicating. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author isn't responding. Is this wrong?\n\nFrom one angle, ghosting is generally seen as disrespectful because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. Even if the author is hurt, cutting off communication without explaining their feelings could be inconsiderate. The friend might be trying to be understanding, but the author isn't giving her a chance to respond or adjust. \n\nHowever, the author is in emotional pain and might not be ready to interact. They might feel that being friends would be too hard and that ghosting is a way to protect both from further hurt. But usually, it's better to communicate that they need space, even if they can't continue the friendship. That way, the friend knows it's about the author's feelings, not something else.\n\nSo, the author's action is understandable emotionally, but maybe not the best approach. They could be in the wrong for not communicating their feelings instead of just ghosting. The friend might be left wondering what they did wrong. However, the author's feelings are valid too. They don't have to stay friends if it's too painful, but handling it with more communication might be better.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether you prioritize the friend's need for closure or the author's need to avoid pain. Since ghosting is often viewed negatively, the author might be in the wrong for not explaining their situation. But there's nuance here. Maybe the correct answer is A (they are in the wrong) because they could have communicated their feelings instead of just disappearing. Even if they don't want to be friends, a clear message would be more respectful.\n"
