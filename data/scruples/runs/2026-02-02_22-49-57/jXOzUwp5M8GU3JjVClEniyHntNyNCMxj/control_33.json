      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a friend they've known since spring, shared interests, and got close. They developed feelings, confessed them, and were rejected. Now, they're avoiding the friend by not responding to texts, which is ghosting. The friend still wants to be friends, but the author finds it painful to continue the friendship because their feelings haven't changed.\n\nSo, the question is: is the author in the wrong here? The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI remember that ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and can leave the other person confused. But in this case, the author was rejected and is struggling with their emotions. They might be avoiding the situation to protect themselves or the friend. However, even if they're hurt, ghosting isn't a respectful way to handle it. The friend tried to maintain the friendship, and the author didn't communicate their discomfort, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author's emotional state. They might not be ready to be friends anymore, and trying to force it could lead to more pain. However, the right approach would be to have an open conversation about their feelings instead of cutting off contact. Ghosting leaves the friend in the dark and doesn't allow for resolution.\n\nSo, on one hand, the author is acting out of their own emotional pain. On the other hand, they could be inconsiderate by not explaining their actions. The key point here is communication. If they can't be friends, they should communicate that respectfully. Ghosting is a form of avoidance and doesn't address the issue constructively.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate their feelings and instead chose to ghost, which is unfair to the friend. Even if they can't be friends, being honest would be better. So, answer A.\n"
