We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong after ghosting their friend following a rejection. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author had a friend since spring, shared interests, and developed feelings. They confessed but were turned down. The friend is still trying to be friends, but the author is avoiding them because it's painful. \n\nHmm, the key points here are about communication and managing emotions. Ghosting usually means cutting off suddenly without explanation. The author's friend is reaching out to maintain the friendship, which is a positive sign. But the author is ghosting them because they can't handle the emotional pain of being in a friendship with unresolved feelings.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, ghosting can be seen as rude because it leaves the other person confused. However, the author's reason is understandable\u2014they're struggling with emotional pain. The friend wants to continue the relationship, but the author isn't ready. But instead of explaining their feelings and setting boundaries, they're avoiding it. \n\nIn healthy relationships, communication is key. Even if you can't be friends right now, being honest about your reasons helps both parties. The author might not be in the wrong for needing space, but the way they're handling it (ghosting) is problematic. It's better to be upfront and say they need time to process, which might lead to a more respectful distance rather than ghosting. \n\nSo the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong) because ghosting isn't a good approach. They should communicate their feelings instead of cutting off contact. But maybe there's a nuance where the situation is tough. Still, the act of ghosting is considered hurtful and a lack of communication. So I think the correct choice is A.\n"
