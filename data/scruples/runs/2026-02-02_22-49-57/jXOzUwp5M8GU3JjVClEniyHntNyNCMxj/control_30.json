      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user had a friend they've known since spring. They shared common interests and got along well. The user developed feelings for this friend but was too shy to act on them. Eventually, they confessed their feelings and asked her out. She was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now, the user is avoiding her texts and interactions because they can't go back to being just friends. The friend still wants to maintain the friendship and reaches out, but the user finds it painful and is ghosting.\n\nFirst, I should consider whether ghosting is an appropriate response here. Ghosting usually refers to cutting off all communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. However, the user says they don't hold it against her and aren't being negative, but they can't handle the friendship anymore because of unresolved feelings. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that their feelings haven't changed, and staying friends would be painful. They might be prioritizing their own emotional well-being. However, the friend is trying to maintain the relationship, which can be valid too. The user is avoiding communication, which might leave the friend confused or hurt since there's no closure. \n\nBut the user is honest about their own feelings and the situation. They're not pretending to be okay when they aren't. So maybe they aren't the \"bad guy\" here. On the other hand, cutting off communication without telling the friend directly could be seen as inconsiderate. The user could explain their need for space to process feelings, which might make it easier for both parties. \n\nI need to think about the ethical implications. Is it wrong to ghost someone if you genuinely can't continue the friendship? Some might say it's better to be honest and set boundaries rather than ghost. Others might argue that it's their right to step back if being around someone is causing them pain. \n\nThe key points are the user's unresolved feelings and the friend's attempts to reconnect. The user's actions are driven by their emotional state, but the friend might feel abandoned. The user could be in the wrong for not communicating their feelings directly and letting the friend down gently, but since they were already rejected once, maybe they're just struggling to adjust. \n\nAlternatively, the user is not in the wrong for needing to distance themselves. It's important to take care of one's mental health. However, the method of handling it (ghosting) could be problematic. Maybe the right approach is to have an open conversation about their inability to continue the friendship, instead of just ghosting. But the question is whether the user is in the wrong as it is. \n\nIn summary, the user's intentions are to protect their own feelings, but the ghosting aspect might be hurting the other person. The answer depends on whether the lack of communication is considered wrong despite the user's reasoning. I think the answer is B (No), because the user isn't being malicious, but they could handle it better. However, some might argue that they should have communicated their decision to take a break directly. But since the user is avoiding texts and approaching, and not being hostile, maybe it's not entirely their fault. Wait, the user is avoiding texts and approaching, so maybe they are still in the wrong for not being upfront. Hmm. The question is whether they are in the wrong. The friend is trying to reach out, and the user is ignoring it. Even if the user is dealing with their own emotions, the act of ghosting without explanation could be seen as inconsiderate. So maybe the answer is A (Yes). But I'm a bit torn because the user isn't pretending to be okay and is honest about their feelings. However, the ghosting part is where they might be in the wrong. Let me check standard viewpoints on this. Typically, ghosting is frowned upon because it lacks communication. The user could have said they need time to process or can't continue the friendship. So maybe they should have done that. Therefore, they are in the wrong for not communicating their decision. So answer A.\n"
