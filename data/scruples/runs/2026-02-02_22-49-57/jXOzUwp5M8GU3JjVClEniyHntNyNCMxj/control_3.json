      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friend they liked, asked her out, she turned them down, and now they're ghosting her because they can't be friends anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author confessed their feelings, the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. The author doesn't hold it against her but feels like the friendship can't go back to how it was. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author is ignoring her texts and avoiding her.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is wrong for ghosting after being rejected. Let's think about social norms and expectations here. When someone is rejected, it's common to feel hurt and need space. However, ghosting without communication can be seen as rude or inconsiderate, even if the person is struggling emotionally.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that being friends is painful because their feelings haven't changed. They might be prioritizing their own emotional well-being by cutting off contact to avoid ongoing discomfort. On the other hand, the friend is trying to maintain the relationship, and the author's silence could be hurting her too. \n\nIn many cases, people are expected to communicate their boundaries, even if it's uncomfortable. Ghosting can leave the other person confused or feeling dismissed. However, if the author isn't ready to be friends and needs time, it's reasonable to take that time. But completely cutting off contact without explanation might be seen as the wrong approach. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's actions are considerate. If they're being honest about their need for space but not intentionally ignoring the friend out of spite, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if they could have communicated their feelings instead of ghosting, that might show a lack of consideration. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and effort to communicate. Ghosting is usually frowned upon, but if the person is dealing with emotional pain, some might be more understanding. The author's situation is a bit of a gray area. They have valid feelings, but their method of handling it could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if they're truly unable to be friends and don't want to fake it, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). While ghosting isn't ideal, the context of unrequited feelings and the inability to maintain the friendship as before might justify their actions. It's not their fault for having feelings or needing space. However, the better approach would have been to explain their feelings to the friend instead of ghosting, but that doesn't mean they're in the wrong for choosing to distance themselves.\n"
