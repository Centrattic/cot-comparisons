We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting a friend after being turned down. The situation is that they had a good friendship, the author confessed feelings, the friend was kind but rejected them. Now, the friend wants to stay friends and tries to reach out, but the author is ignoring her and avoiding her, feeling it's too painful.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if ghosting is the right approach here. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author is struggling to move past the rejection. \n\nThe author's reasons: they still have feelings and think remaining friends would be painful. The friend is okay with continuing the relationship as friends. So the author is choosing to end the friendship instead of trying to adjust. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, the friend is being considerate and wants to keep things the same. The author's choice to ghost could be seen as avoiding the situation and possibly hurting the friend further by not communicating. However, the author's emotional state is valid. They might not be ready to handle the friendship anymore. \n\nBut the key point is that the friend was clear about not wanting to change the dynamic, and the author is not giving them closure. Ghosting can leave the other person confused or feeling rejected again. The author might be in the wrong for not having an honest conversation about their feelings and reluctance to continue the friendship. \n\nAlternatively, if the author is genuinely not able to cope and needs space, maybe it's understandable, but still not the best approach. The right thing would be to communicate their need for distance while respecting the friend's feelings, rather than ghosting. \n\nSo the answer is probably A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their decision properly, even if their feelings are legitimate. Ghosting isn't considerate, and the friend deserves an explanation. But maybe there's a nuance where the author isn't at fault for their feelings, but the action of ghosting is. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting. \n\nHmm. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the ghosting. The friend was trying to maintain the friendship, and the author is avoiding communication. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's disrespectful and lacks closure. So even if the author's feelings are valid, the act of ghosting is still wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
