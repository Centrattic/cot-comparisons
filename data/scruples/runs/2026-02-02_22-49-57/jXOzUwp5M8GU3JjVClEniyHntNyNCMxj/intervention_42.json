We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that they had a good friendship, the author developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now is avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author was friends first, had mutual interests, then confessed. The friend turned them down but wants to stay friends. The author can't handle the friendship anymore because it's painful, so they ghost. \n\nIs ghosting justified? Well, the author isn't in the wrong for having feelings or finding the friendship painful post-rejection. However, ghosting without communication can be seen as inconsiderate. The friend might feel hurt by the sudden cutoff. The right approach is usually to explain why you need space, even if you can't stay friends. \n\nBut the author says they don't hold it against the friend and it's not their fault. They just can't go back. So maybe they're making a choice for their own well-being. But is that fair to the other person? It depends on how the friend reacts. If the author had communicated their need for space, it would be clearer. Ghosting can be seen as avoiding the situation, which might be inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, the author is not necessarily \"in the wrong\" because they're dealing with their emotions. But is their action (ghosting) the correct one? There's a difference between being in the wrong morally and the action being unkind. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so the answer might be B (No), because they're not morally wrong for prioritizing their feelings, but their method of handling it (ghosting) is questionable. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about whether the method is kind. So maybe the answer is B, they aren't in the wrong, but they could handle it better.\n"
