I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for bringing in delicious food to the office to wreck her coworkers' diets. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is dealing with four coworkers who are rude to her. She heard they're cliquish, and one of them is leaving her off emails. The author thinks they might be jealous because she's younger and makes more money. She's been bringing in snacks like cookies, pastries, and cheese to the office kitchen. She encourages the dieting coworkers to eat a little, knowing it might crack their willpower. The rest of the department (20 people) also enjoy the snacks.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. So, is this a case of justified retaliation or crossing a line?\n\nOn one hand, she's being proactive in disrupting the diets of the rude coworkers. They were the ones who started being mean. But on the other hand, she's using the food as a weapon against them, even if it's indirectly affecting others. Also, she's not just targeting them but feeding the whole department. Maybe the others aren't on diets, so it's a positive for them. But the main issue is with the four women.\n\nIs it okay to use someone else's willpower weakness against them? The coworkers chose to diet, so maybe they're responsible for their own choices. But the author is taking advantage of their situation to get under their skin. That could be seen as manipulative. Also, if the author is doing this to get back at them for being rude, is that fair? It's like an office prank but with potential health implications.\n\nAnother angle: bringing snacks is a common office culture. If she's doing it for everyone, maybe that's a good thing. But she's specifically targeting these four with comments like \"just a little piece won't hurt,\" which is a provocation. She's aware that this might undermine their diets, which is intentional. That seems like a personal vendetta disguised as a snack service.\n\nAlso, the coworkers' diets are their personal choice. The author has no right to interfere with that, regardless of the rudeness. Retaliation in the workplace can lead to a toxic environment. Even if the coworkers are rude, the author's method of response is inappropriate. It's not addressing the root issue but creating a new problem.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is using a harmful tactic to get back at her coworkers, which is unprofessional. Even if she's not the one being directly rude, her actions are contributing to a hostile work environment. Therefore, she is in the wrong.\n"
