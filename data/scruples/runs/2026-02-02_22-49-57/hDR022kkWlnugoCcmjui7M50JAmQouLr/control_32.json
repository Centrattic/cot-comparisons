I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is bringing in delicious food to the office specifically to mess up their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are a group of four women who've been rude to them since they started. The author heard they're cliquish and they're eating salads for lunch because they're dieting. The author brings in snacks like cookies and pastries, encourages them to eat a little bit, and it seems like it's working because the coworkers are now taking the food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The main issue here is whether intentionally undermining someone's dieting efforts is justified because of personal grievances. The author is motivated by the coworkers being rude, possibly due to jealousy over age and salary. But does that give them the right to interfere with the coworkers' health goals?\n\nOn one hand, the author is retaliating against perceived unfair treatment. They might feel that the coworkers' behavior is unkind, so they're doing something to even the scales. However, using food to sabotage someone's diet could be seen as a form of passive-aggressive behavior. Even if the author isn't directly forcing them to eat, they're making it easier for the coworkers to give in to cravings, which could have health implications. \n\nAnother angle is that the author is also providing food for others in the department, which is appreciated. That part is positive. But the targeted approach towards these specific coworkers who are dieting makes it problematic. It's a form of targeted manipulation, even if it's not malicious in the sense of physical harm. It's more about emotional or social retaliation.\n\nThen there's the question of the coworkers' right to their diet choices. The author might feel that the coworkers shouldn't be dieting if they're unhappy with their health, but the author isn't the one making that judgment. Plus, dieting can be for health reasons, not just about weight loss. So interfering with that might not be ethical, regardless of the author's motivations.\n\nAlso, the author's approach could be seen as petty. Instead of addressing the issue of being excluded from emails or the workplace rudeness through proper channels, like talking to HR or a manager, they're taking a personal vendetta. That could create a hostile work environment and might lead to more tension in the office.\n\nIn summary, while the coworkers' behavior is questionable, the author's method of retaliation is likely to be seen as crossing a line. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
