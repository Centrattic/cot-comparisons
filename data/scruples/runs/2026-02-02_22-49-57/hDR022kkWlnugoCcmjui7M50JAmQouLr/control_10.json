I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing in delicious food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation involves some coworkers being rude to the author, and the author is trying to get back at them by undermining their diets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is using knowledge about dieting and willpower to tempt their coworkers into eating unhealthy food. The coworkers are part of a group that's been mean to the author. But the author is also feeding the rest of the department, which other people seem to appreciate. However, the main question is about the author's actions towards the specific four women.\n\nIs it okay to target specific people's diets out of spite? Even if the author has valid grievances, using food as a weapon might cross a line. The coworkers might not be intentionally trying to harm the author, but the author's response is to interfere with their personal choices. It's possible that the author is justified in feeling upset, but is this the right way to handle it?\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they're not directly telling the coworkers to eat the food, but rather setting it up so that the coworkers take it when they feel hesitant. This could be seen as manipulative. Even if it's not a direct confrontation, it's a passive-aggressive form of retaliation that affects others in the workplace.\n\nAnother angle: the author is using their own position to influence others' health decisions. That might be considered a violation of personal boundaries. Plus, the author is assuming that the coworkers are on diets to lose weight, which could be sensitive information. Even if the author isn't certain about the reasons for the coworkers' rudeness, they're acting on assumptions.\n\nThe fact that the author is doing this in the office kitchen, where others can access the food, might mean that it's not just targeting the four women but affecting others. However, the author claims that the others are feeding the department, so maybe the author feels it's a mutual benefit. But the specific intent to undermine the four coworkers' diets is a key point here.\n\nWorkplace etiquette usually discourages passive-aggressive behavior. Even if the coworkers are being rude, the author's method of retaliation could be seen as unprofessional and potentially harmful. Dieting is a personal choice, and undermining that could be seen as a form of bullying, especially if it's done out of spite.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have reasons to be upset, using food to mess with coworkers' diets is likely crossing a line. It's not a productive way to address interpersonal conflicts and could be seen as unkind and manipulative. So the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
