I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for bringing in food to wreck their coworkers' diets. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that a group of four women in the office are rude to them. The coworkers started dieting together and ate salads. The author started bringing in snacks like cookies and pastries, encouraging the women to indulge, leading them to eat more. The author's reasoning is that they're retaliating against the rude behavior and that others in the department appreciate the snacks.\n\nNow, the ethical angle here. The author is intentionally undermining the diets of specific coworkers. Even though the food is available to everyone, the author is specifically targeting these women by suggesting they give in. But is that justified? The author feels targeted by the women and is acting out of spite. However, using food as a weapon is a bit of a passive-aggressive move. It's not directly harmful like spreading rumors, but it's still being manipulative in a way. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as petty. While the coworkers were rude, encouraging them to eat more isn't a constructive response. It could lead to health issues if the diets are medically necessary. Also, the author is making assumptions about the coworkers' motivations and health goals. The author might be projecting their own struggles with weight onto the coworkers, but not everyone's diet is the same. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is sharing food with the entire department, which is a positive aspect. But the intent here is to specifically target those on diets. The line between sharing and sabotage is thin. The author's actions could be seen as taking revenge in a sneaky way, which isn't fair. \n\nIn terms of workplace ethics, being respectful is key. Even if the coworkers are rude, the author should address the behavior directly rather than retaliate. The author might feel justified, but their actions could be considered inconsiderate and unprofessional. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they're intentionally undermining others in a passive-aggressive manner, even if the food is available to all. Their actions are a form of retaliation that's not constructive and could have negative consequences.\n"
