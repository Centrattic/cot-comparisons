I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for bringing in food to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation involves a group of women who are being rude to the author, and the author is retaliating by providing tempting snacks to undermine their dieting efforts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author mentions that the coworkers are being unnecessarily rude and cliquish. The assistant to the boss even excludes them from social emails. That's a valid reason for the author feeling upset. However, the method of retaliation is questionable. \n\nBringing in food for everyone in the department might seem like a nice gesture on the surface, but the intent here is specifically to \"wreck their diets.\" The author is actively trying to undermine these coworkers' health goals, which could be seen as manipulative. Even if others enjoy the snacks, the author is using the food as a tool for revenge against personal grievances. \n\nAlso, the author is aware of the psychological tactics involved, like using phrases such as \"just a little piece won't hurt\" to exploit willpower. This seems calculated and possibly harmful, especially if the coworkers have legitimate health reasons for dieting. \n\nWhile the author might feel justified in wanting to stand up to the bullies, the approach taken could be considered inconsiderate. It's possible that the author's actions could harm not just the targets but others as well, even if unintentionally. Plus, there's a power dynamic here if the assistant to the boss is excluding the author from social functions, which might indicate a workplace issue that should be addressed through proper channels rather than personal retaliation.\n\nSo, even though the coworkers are being rude, the author's method of response crosses a line. It's not just about the food; it's about the intent to harm others' diets and the manipulation involved. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
