I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing in food to wreck their coworkers' diets. The situation is that the author has four coworkers who are being rude and cliquish, especially the boss's assistant who leaves them off emails. The author brings in snacks like cookies and pastries, knowing these coworkers are on a diet. They say things like \"just a little piece won't hurt\" and it seems like the coworkers are giving in. The author also mentions feeding the rest of the department, who are appreciative.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions are justified. The coworkers are being unfriendly, but does that give the author the right to target their diets? Even if the author feels targeted, intentionally undermining someone's diet could be seen as a form of retaliation, which might be unprofessional. Diets are personal, and while the author might think they're helping others by providing snacks, they're directly affecting the coworkers' health goals. \n\nAlso, the author is using psychological tactics, like knowing that even a small crack in willpower can lead to cravings. That manipulation aspect could be problematic. Even if the rest of the department likes the snacks, it doesn't excuse targeting specific coworkers. The author's actions might be seen as a childish way of getting back at the group, which could lead to a hostile work environment. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't directly harming them physically, just making food available. But the intent here is to \"wreck diets,\" which is a deliberate act. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Considering workplace behavior norms, it's generally expected to act professionally even if there are conflicts. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because their actions are a form of retaliation and could be seen as unprofessional, regardless of the coworkers' behavior.\n"
