I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves bringing food to work to mess with coworkers' diets because they're being rude to them.\n\nFirst, the person is dealing with a clique of women who've been mean since day one. They're accused of being cliquish and excluding the author. The author is trying to undermine their diets by bringing tempting snacks. The author mentions that others in the department also enjoy the food, so it's not just targeting the rude coworkers.\n\nNow, the question is whether this is in the wrong. The key points here are intent and actions. The author's intention is revenge for being treated poorly. But is sabotaging someone's diet a justified or acceptable form of retaliation? Even if the coworkers are unfriendly, intentionally causing someone to break their diet might be seen as crossing a line. It's a passive-aggressive way of getting back at them, which could be considered mean-spirited. Also, the author is using food as a weapon, which could be seen as harmful, especially if those coworkers have health goals. However, the author is also providing food for others, which is positive. But the main issue is targeting those who are dieting without their consent. \n\nAnother angle: the author might not have a good relationship with these coworkers, but that doesn't justify undermining their personal choices. It's possible that the author's actions are fostering a hostile work environment, even if unintentionally. Also, the author's method of retaliation might be seen as unprofessional. \n\nIn terms of ethics and workplace behavior, it's generally considered inappropriate to target specific individuals' personal habits, even if they're being rude. The author's actions could be seen as a form of bullying or creating a toxic atmosphere. Even if others benefit from the food, the intent to specifically disrupt those diets is problematic. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions are likely in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
