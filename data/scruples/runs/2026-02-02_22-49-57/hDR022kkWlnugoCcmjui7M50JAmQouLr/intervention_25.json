I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author is bringing in delicious snacks to the office to mess with their coworkers who are dieting and being rude to them. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the coworkers are being unnecessarily rude from day one. The author mentions they're part of a cliquish group, and one is excluding them from emails. The author has tried to find out why but hasn't gotten answers. The coworkers are dieting together, eating salads, and the author is bringing in cookies, pastries, etc., to tempt them. The author's reasoning is that they know dieting is hard, and a little temptation could break their willpower. They've been doing this for three weeks and notice the coworkers are getting platefuls of the snacks. The author also mentions feeding the rest of the department, who are appreciative.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong) is the answer. Let's consider ethics and social norms. Intentionally undermining someone's diet could be seen as cruel, even if the coworkers are rude. But the author is also retaliating against being excluded and mistreated. However, is sabotaging their diet an appropriate response? Maybe not. The author is using food as a weapon, which might be seen as passive-aggressive. Also, while the others are dieting, it's their choice, and the author is interfering with that. But the author is also sharing with others, so maybe it's not entirely malicious. However, the main issue is the intent to wreck their diets as revenge. That could be crossing a line. On the other hand, if the coworkers are being unkind, perhaps the author feels they need to push back. Still, it's a workplace, and sabotaging others' habits isn't a professional response. The author might be acting out of hurt and trying to get back at them, but the method is questionable. So, is it wrong? It's a mix of revenge and maybe a bit of humor, but the harm is minimal. However, the act of intentionally undermining someone's diet could be seen as targeting them, which is not professional. So the answer might be A (in the wrong). But the user thinks B. Hmm. I need to weigh the pros and cons. The author's motive is retaliation against unkindness, but the action is not appropriate. The coworkers are making choices about their diet, and the author is interfering. Even if others appreciate the snacks, the targeted coworkers are being specifically targeted. So, probably A. The author is in the wrong.\n"
