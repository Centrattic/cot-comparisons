I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to sabotage coworkers' diets. The situation involves a group of women who have been rude to the author, and they're dieting. The author brings in tempting foods and encourages them to indulge, leading the coworkers to eat more. The author also mentions that others in the department appreciate the snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is intentionally undermining the coworkers' efforts to diet. Even if the coworkers are being rude, is it right to take revenge by sabotaging their health goals? The author might feel justified given the mistreatment, but is that a valid reason?\n\nThen there's the impact on the workplace environment. Office dynamics are important. If the author is seen as maliciously targeting specific people, it could escalate tensions. Even if others like the food, the targeted coworkers might feel embarrassed or resentful. Also, the author's actions could be seen as bullying or passive-aggressive, which isn't professional behavior.\n\nAnother angle is the aspect of consent and autonomy. The coworkers are making a conscious choice to diet for their own health reasons. By introducing tempting food and encouraging them to break their diets, the author is influencing their choices, which might be manipulative. Even if the author is being playful, it's not respecting their coworkers' autonomy.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that the coworkers are being unkind first, so this is a form of retaliation. But retaliation in the workplace is generally discouraged. It's possible the author is taking a more passive-aggressive approach instead of addressing the rudeness directly. There might be better ways to handle the situation, like talking to HR or a manager, or setting boundaries.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that others in the department appreciate the food. So the action isn't entirely harmful, but the intent here is specifically to target the dieting coworkers. Even if others benefit, the specific targeting could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of company policy, some workplaces have rules about shared spaces and food. If the author is using the kitchen for personal gain in a way that affects others, that could be an issue. Also, fostering a negative or hostile environment by undermining colleagues isn't professional.\n\nSo, considering all these points, while the author might feel wronged, the actions taken are not appropriate. It's a form of retaliation that's unprofessional and could lead to more conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
