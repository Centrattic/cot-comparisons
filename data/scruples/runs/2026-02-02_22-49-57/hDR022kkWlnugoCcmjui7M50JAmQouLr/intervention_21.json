I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the person is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story did the wrong thing by bringing in food to disrupt their coworkers' diets. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author works with four women who've been rude to them since day one. They suspect clique behavior and exclusion, like being left out of social emails by one of them. The author brings in unhealthy snacks knowing these women are dieting, encouraging them to indulge. They say it's working because the women take the food, and others in the department also appreciate the snacks.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are intent, the impact on others, and workplace etiquette. The author's motivation is revenge for being mistreated, which is understandable\u2014people do get fed up with workplace cliques and exclusion. But acting on that by undermining someone's diet crosses into personal territory. Dieting is a personal choice, and intentionally sabotaging it could be seen as a form of bullying or passive-aggressive behavior. Even if others benefit from the snacks, the targeted action against specific coworkers might be problematic.\n\nAlso, workplace etiquette usually involves not interfering in others' personal habits unless it's something that affects the work environment. The author is targeting specific people, which could be interpreted as retaliation. Even if the author feels justified, the method might not be appropriate. The line between playful teasing and actual sabotage is thin here. Saying \"just a little piece won't hurt\" with the intention to derail their diets might be crossing that line.\n\nHowever, the author isn't directly harming anyone's job performance or health in a significant way, but they are encouraging behaviors that others are trying to avoid. The other coworkers might feel disrespected or that their efforts are being mocked. In the workplace, fostering a positive environment is important. The author's actions, while humorous to some, could be seen as undermining the morale of those targeted. So even if the author feels they're getting back at rude coworkers, the method could be considered wrong because it's personal and not addressing the root issue (the rudeness) directly.\n\nSo, overall, while the author has valid grievances, the way they're addressing them by targeting others' personal health goals might be inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
