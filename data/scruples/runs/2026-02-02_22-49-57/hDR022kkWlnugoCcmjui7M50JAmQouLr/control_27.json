I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is bringing in delicious food to the office specifically to mess with their coworkers' diets. These coworkers are part of a group that's been rude to them. The author seems to be retaliating by undermining their diets, knowing that even a small indulgence can break their willpower. The author also mentions that others in the department enjoy the snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The coworkers are being mean to the author, so the author is trying to get back at them. But is it okay to mess with someone's diet like that, even if they're being rude? Dieting is a personal choice, and while the author might think they're helping by making it harder, it's actually interfering with the other person's goals. Plus, the author is using manipulation here, like saying \"just a little piece won't hurt,\" which is tempting them to give in.\n\nAlso, the author is bringing food for the whole department, which others appreciate. But the intent here is to specifically target the rude coworkers. So even though others benefit, the main action is directed at those four women. That's a bit underhanded because it's a form of revenge, not just sharing snacks. \n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that the coworkers left them off emails and are cliquish. The author is trying to even the score. However, using food to undermine someone's diet could be seen as harmful. It's not physically harmful, but it's emotionally manipulative. The author is exploiting their knowledge of willpower to cause the coworkers to fail at their diet, which could lead to frustration or other negative emotions for them.\n\nAlso, the author is doing this for three weeks and seems satisfied that it's working. There's a sense of enjoyment in seeing the coworkers give in. That might be crossing a line from self-defense to active sabotage. The author's actions might be considered unethical because they're using a personal struggle (the coworkers' dieting) to retaliate against their social behavior.\n\nBut then again, the author isn't directly targeting them; they're just bringing food for everyone. The coworkers are the ones choosing to take it. The author isn't forcing them. However, the intention to influence their choices through temptation is there. It's a form of passive aggression. The line here is between sharing food (which is generally positive) and using it as a weapon against people you dislike.\n\nIn terms of office etiquette, it's not uncommon to share snacks, but doing so with the intent to undermine someone's personal goals could be problematic. The author's actions might be seen as petty and unprofessional. Even if the coworkers are rude, the response should ideally be more constructive, like addressing the behavior directly rather than seeking revenge through diet sabotage.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's intent and the manipulative tactics used suggest that they are in the wrong. The action, while not illegal, is ethically questionable and unkind, even if the coworkers were rude first. Retaliation in this way can create a hostile work environment and doesn't resolve the underlying issue.\n"
