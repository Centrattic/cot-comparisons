I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that there are four women in the office who are being rude to the author. The author heard they're cliquish and one is leaving them off emails. The author started bringing in snacks like cookies and pastries, encouraging the women to eat them, knowing they're on diets. The author's reasoning is that these women could stand to lose weight and the author is helping them by tempting them with food. The author also mentions that other coworkers appreciate the snacks.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. First, the author's coworkers are on diets, and the author is intentionally trying to disrupt that. The author is aware that small cracks in willpower can lead to cravings. So, is this a form of bullying or retaliation for the rude behavior they've been experiencing?\n\nOn one hand, the author is retaliating against people who've been mean and exclusive. The author might feel that since these women are being rude, bringing food to tempt them is a way to get back at them. But is that justified? Also, the author is sharing the food with the rest of the department, so it's not just targeting those four specifically. But the author is specifically targeting those four by encouraging them to eat, knowing their diets. The comment \"a little piece won't hurt\" is almost a provocation, knowing they're trying to diet. \n\nBut is it the author's place to do this? The author assumes the coworkers need to lose weight, which is a judgment call. Even if it's true, is it okay to sabotage someone's diet? Also, the author is taking actions that could undermine someone else's health efforts, even if it's in a light-hearted way. The coworkers might feel disrespected or targeted. \n\nThe author is responding to being treated poorly, but using food as a weapon might not be appropriate. While the author might feel justified given the treatment, the action of intentionally wrecking their diets could be seen as mean-spirited, even if others are appreciative. It's a bit of a passive-aggressive retaliation. The author is feeding the department, which is a positive, but the intent towards those four is negative. \n\nAlso, the coworkers might not appreciate being judged for their weight or their dieting efforts. Even if the author's intention is to help them by showing them that dieting is hard, it's a bit manipulative. The author knows about their diets and is exploiting that to get them to break their own rules. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is using food as a tool for revenge, which might not be the right approach. Even if the coworkers are rude, the author's action is crossing a line by targeting their personal choices and health goals. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
