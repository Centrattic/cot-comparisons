I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves bringing delicious food to the office to mess with coworkers' diets who are being rude to them. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that a group of four women have been unnecessarily rude from day one, and there's a clique issue. They heard that one of the women is excluding them from emails. They suspect jealousy because the author is younger and makes more money. The author is trying to get back at them by providing tempting snacks, knowing that a little indulgence could lead to giving up their diets.\n\nNow, the question is whether this is justified. The author is targeting specific coworkers who are dieting, but others in the department seem to appreciate the snacks. The author's actions are a form of retaliation against perceived slights. But is it wrong?\n\nOn one hand, the author is causing intentional harm to others' diets as revenge for being rude. That's a bit of a passive-aggressive approach. It's not physically harmful, but it's undermining their health goals. The author is using food as a weapon, which could be seen as unethical.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers were the ones who started being rude first. The author might feel that this is a harmless way to get back at them, especially since others benefit. However, even if the coworkers are jerks, the author's method could be considered unprofessional or petty. It's possible that the author is escalating a conflict in a way that's not appropriate in a workplace setting.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they're feeding the whole department, but they specifically target the rude coworkers with temptations. That could create a hostile work environment or further tension. Even if the author feels wronged, intentionally sabotaging others' diets for revenge isn't a constructive response. It's more of a personal vendetta, which might reflect poorly on the author's character.\n\nIn terms of ethics, revenge isn't typically considered a positive response. The author's actions could backfire if the coworkers find out the intent, leading to more conflict. The fact that others appreciate the snacks doesn't mitigate the fact that the author is targeting specific people with malicious intent.\n\nSo, considering all that, even though there's a reason behind the author's actions, the method used is not the right approach. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're engaging in a petty and unprofessional act of retaliation, which isn't justified even if the coworkers were rude.\n"
