I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about bringing food to work to mess with coworkers' diets because they're being rude. The person is retaliating against the group of four women who've been unfriendly since day one. They bring in snacks like cookies and pastries, encouraging coworkers to indulge, which the author thinks is working because those women are eating the snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is intentionally undermining their coworkers' diets. Even though the coworkers are being rude, is it justified to take revenge by sabotaging their health goals? The author mentions that the department appreciates the snacks, so maybe they're not entirely wrong. But the main question is about the targeted coworkers. \n\nIs it right to use food as a weapon? Even if the author feels targeted, intentionally making it harder for others to stick to their diets could be seen as a form of retaliation that's not professional. It might also be harmful, especially if the coworkers have health reasons for dieting. Plus, the author is admitting to knowing about the power of willpower cracks, which adds a manipulative element. \n\nThen there's the aspect of workplace dynamics. If the coworkers are indeed being unkind, the author might feel justified, but the method they're using could escalate tensions. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions are considered a reasonable response or an overstep. Also, the fact that others in the department enjoy the snacks complicates things, but the intent here is specifically to target the dieting group. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions are manipulative and unprofessional, even if the coworkers were rude. The right approach would be to address the rudeness directly or through proper channels, not by undermining their diets. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
