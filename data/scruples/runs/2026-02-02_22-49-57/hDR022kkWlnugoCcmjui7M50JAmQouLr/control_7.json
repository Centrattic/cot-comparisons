I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has four coworkers who are being rude to them. In response, the author has started bringing in delicious food like cookies, pastries, and cheese platters to the office kitchen. The goal seems to be to wreck the coworkers' diets since they're all trying to lose weight. The author mentions that others are appreciative, but the main target is the four women who are being mean.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's actions are justified. The coworkers are being unnecessarily rude, so maybe the author is retaliating. But is it okay to sabotage someone's diet by offering them tempting snacks? Let's break it down. The author is providing food that others enjoy, which might be a form of passive-aggressive revenge. However, the coworkers are trying to diet, and the author is encouraging them to break it by offering treats. \n\nEven if the author knows that willpower can be weak, is it right to exploit that? The author is directly targeting these coworkers, knowing their intentions to diet. But the food is available to everyone, so it's not like they're hiding it or forcing people to eat. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn the office context, sharing food is common and usually seen as a positive. But the author's intent here is to mess with the coworkers' diets. That adds a negative motive. The coworkers might feel that their efforts to diet are being undermined, which could be stressful. However, if the food is in a shared space, others have the choice to partake or not. The author isn't making them eat, just tempting them. \n\nBut the post also mentions that the author is doing this to get back at people who are rude. Retaliation can be a tricky area. Even if the coworkers are being mean, is it acceptable to respond by sabotaging their diet? It's a form of payback, but it's indirect and might not address the root of the problem. The assistant for the boss is excluding the author from emails, which is a more direct form of rudeness. The author's action is a way to push back, but is it fair?\n\nAnother angle: the author is using the shared kitchen to target specific individuals. While the food is available to all, the author's comments like \"just a little piece won't hurt\" might be specifically directed at the four women. This could be seen as mocking their efforts or making them feel bad about their dieting, which is a form of bullying or harassment. \n\nIn an office setting, creating a hostile environment is a problem. The author's actions, even if well-intentioned for others, could be contributing to a negative atmosphere for those trying to diet. The coworkers might not want to face that temptation, and the author's behavior could potentially harm their health goals, which they might see as a personal attack. \n\nAlso, the author's motive is revenge for being excluded and treated rudely. But is that a valid justification? The correct approach would usually be to address the issue directly, maybe through HR or management, rather than retaliate with actions that could affect the coworkers' health or create a toxic environment. \n\nSo, even though the author isn't forcing anyone to eat, the intent to undermine their diets for revenge might be considered wrong. The office should be a respectful place, and using food as a weapon, even indirectly, could be seen as unprofessional or harmful. The answer might be A, the author is in the wrong, because they're using others' personal goals against them in a way that's not respectful and could contribute to a hostile work environment.\n"
