I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is that they're bringing in delicious food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets, specifically four women who are being rude to them. The writer mentions that these coworkers are part of a clique, exclude them from emails, and maybe are jealous because the writer is younger and makes more money. The writer is using their knowledge of dieting to tempt the coworkers into eating the snacks, leading them to break their diets. They also note that others in the department enjoy the snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the writer's actions are wrong. The key points here are intent and impact. The writer's main goal is to \"wreck\" their coworkers' diets as a form of retaliation for being treated poorly. While the coworkers might deserve some accountability for their behavior, the writer's method of response involves undermining others' health goals. \n\nEthically, even if someone is being mistreated, seeking revenge or causing harm isn't considered acceptable. The writer is using manipulation by preying on the coworkers' willpower, which is a form of sabotage. Plus, there's the aspect of consent\u2014no one asked for these snacks, especially not to be tempted into breaking their diets. The writer's actions could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the coworkers are difficult.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here: the writer is also providing snacks for the rest of the department, which others appreciate. But that doesn't necessarily justify targeting specific individuals. The intention here is key. The writer is specifically aiming to affect the four women's diets, which is deliberate and could be harmful to their health goals. \n\nAnother angle is that the writer might be seeking some form of justice or payback for being excluded and mistreated. But revenge isn't a socially acceptable or healthy way to handle conflict. It could escalate tensions in the workplace and create a toxic environment. The writer's actions might be seen as childish or unprofessional, potentially leading to further issues in the workplace.\n\nAlso, the writer's justification that \"everyone seems appreciative\" ignores the specific harm done to the four women. The rest of the department enjoying the snacks doesn't negate the targeted effect on those four. The writer's behavior could be considered bullying in reverse, using food as a weapon to get back at the clique.\n\nIn terms of workplace etiquette, sharing snacks is generally a positive thing, but doing so with the intent to undermine someone's health decisions crosses a line. The writer might be in the wrong because their actions are malicious and not just a harmless office tradition. They're using knowledge of dieting to exploit others' vulnerabilities, which is manipulative.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). Even though the coworkers were rude, the method of retaliation is inappropriate and harmful.\n"
