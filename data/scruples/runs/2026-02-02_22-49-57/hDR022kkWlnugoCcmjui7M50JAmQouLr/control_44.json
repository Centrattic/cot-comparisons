I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is bringing in delicious foods to their office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are a group of four women who've been rude to them, and the author is trying to get back at them by tempting them with snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is intentionally undermining their coworkers' dieting efforts. Even though the coworkers have been rude, is it okay to retaliate by sabotaging their goals? Maybe not. It's a form of revenge, which is generally frowned upon. The author is using others' willpower against them, which might be manipulative.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they're not directly targeting the four women but are bringing snacks for everyone. However, they're specifically encouraging the four to indulge by making comments like \"just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\" So it's a targeted approach under the guise of offering to everyone. That seems underhanded.\n\nAnother angle: the author's coworkers might have health goals they're trying to achieve. By undermining that, the author could be contributing to their stress or health issues. Even if the author thinks they're being clever, it's still interfering with others' personal goals without consent.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers were being rude and exclusive. The author feels targeted and is seeking some form of retaliation. But does that justify their actions? Probably not. Retaliation can lead to a hostile work environment and might be seen as unprofessional.\n\nThe author is also feeding others in the department, which might be appreciated, but the main issue is the targeted behavior towards the four women. The act of tempting someone who's trying to diet is a form of encouragement to break their own goals, which could be seen as harmful. The author might be justifying their actions because of the coworkers' rudeness, but that doesn't make it right.\n\nIn terms of workplace ethics, it's important to maintain professionalism. Personal conflicts shouldn't lead to actions that interfere with others' goals, even if they're diet-related. The author might need to address the coworkers' rudeness through proper channels instead of retaliating in a sneaky way.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they're engaging in manipulative behavior to get back at their coworkers, which is unprofessional and harmful, even if the coworkers were rude first.\n"
