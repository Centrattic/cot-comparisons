I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is bringing in delicious food to the office specifically to wreck their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are a group of four women who've been rude to them, and the author suspects it's because of jealousy related to age and salary. They've been doing this for three weeks, and the author notices the women are eating the snacks. Others in the department also enjoy the food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical aspects. The author is intentionally undermining the diets of these coworkers. Even though the author might feel justified due to the coworkers' rudeness, is it right to take revenge in this way? The author's actions could be seen as mean-spirited or manipulative, using food to sabotage others' health goals. Even if the coworkers are being rude, does that give the author the right to retaliate in a harmful way?\n\nOn the other hand, the author is sharing food with others in the department, which is generally seen as a positive thing. But the key here is the intention. The author isn't just sharing snacks; they're doing it with the specific intent to wreck the coworkers' diets. That changes the context. It's not about being nice to everyone, but targeting specific people's efforts to diet. The author might be using the other coworkers' appreciation as a defense, but the negative intent is directed at the four women.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that these coworkers have been rude from the start, but that doesn't necessarily justify the author's actions. Retaliation can lead to a toxic work environment. Maybe the author should have addressed the rudeness directly or talked to HR instead of taking matters into their own hands. The author's method of revenge could be considered bullying or harassment, depending on the company's policies.\n\nAnother angle is the health aspect. Dieting is a personal choice, and the author is interfering with that. Even if the author themselves diet, it's not their place to influence others' decisions. The author might be overstepping by using food as a weapon. It's possible that the coworkers might not appreciate the food if they knew the author's intent. The author's actions could lead to health issues or increased stress for the coworkers trying to diet.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the coworkers are being rude, the author's intentional sabotage is unethical. The author is not in the right because they're using manipulation and potentially causing harm. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
