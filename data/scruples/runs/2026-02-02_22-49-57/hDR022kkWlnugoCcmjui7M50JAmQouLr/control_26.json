I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves bringing in food to the office to disrupt coworkers' diets because those coworkers are being rude to them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is part of an office where a group of four women have been rude to them since they started a year ago. The author suspects this is due to jealousy because they're younger and earn more. The author starts bringing in tempting foods like cookies and pastries, knowing the women are on diets, to \"wreck their diets.\" The author claims it's working because the women take the food, and others in the department appreciate the snacks.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is the author's intent. They're deliberately undermining someone else's health goals, possibly as retaliation for being treated poorly. Even if the coworkers are rude, is it right to take such a passive-aggressive approach?\n\nEthically, sabotaging someone else's efforts, even if out of revenge, is generally considered wrong. It's a form of retaliation, but not in a direct or communication-based way. The author isn't addressing the root issue of the coworkers being rude but instead is taking a passive approach to get back at them. This could be seen as petty or mean-spirited.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they're just sharing food, and others appreciate it. But the intent here is crucial. The author isn't just sharing food; they're doing it with the specific goal of undermining the diets of the rude coworkers. That intent changes the nature of the action from a kind gesture to a malicious one.\n\nAlso, the author's coworkers are free to choose whether to take the food or not. The author's actions don't force them to eat the foods; it's an indirect way to mess with their willpower. But manipulating someone's self-control in this way could be seen as underhanded. It's not a direct confrontation, which might be harder but more honest.\n\nAnother angle: the author could be projecting. If they have experience with dieting and weight fluctuations, maybe they feel these coworkers aren't as in control as they think. However, that doesn't justify the behavior. Everyone has different approaches to health, and respecting others' choices is important.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that the rest of the department appreciates the snacks. So, while the author might be targeting specific people, they're also providing a benefit to others. But that doesn't absolve them of the targeted sabotage. The negative action towards the coworkers still stands.\n\nIn terms of workplace ethics, fostering a positive environment is key. Retaliating against coworkers, even through food, can create a hostile work atmosphere. It's better to address issues directly, perhaps by talking to the coworkers, HR, or finding another resolution rather than engaging in passive-aggressive behavior.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong. The action is a form of retaliation that undermines others' goals and could be seen as mean-spirited, even if it's not overtly harmful. The intent to sabotage, regardless of the outcome, is the key factor here. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
