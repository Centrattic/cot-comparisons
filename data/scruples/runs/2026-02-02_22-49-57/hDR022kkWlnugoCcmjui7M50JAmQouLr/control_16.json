I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for bringing food to the office specifically to wreck their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are a group of four women who are being rude to the author. The author thinks they're being targeted because they're younger and make more money. The author started bringing indulgent snacks, encouraging the coworkers to eat them, which seems to be working as the coworkers are giving in. The rest of the department, about 20 people, are also eating the snacks and are appreciative.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are wrong. The main issue here is intentional sabotage of someone else's diet. While dieting is a personal choice, the author is specifically targeting these coworkers, which could be seen as vindictive or bullying. Even if the coworkers are being rude, retaliating by undermining their health goals might not be the right approach. \n\nBut the author isn't directly harming them physically; they're just offering food. However, the intent is to mess with their diets, which could be considered a form of harassment or mean-spirited behavior. The author mentions they know the coworkers are dieting, so they're exploiting a personal goal. Even if others in the department appreciate the snacks, the targeted coworkers might feel singled out or that their efforts are being mocked.\n\nAnother angle is workplace etiquette. Bringing snacks is common and usually seen as a nice gesture. The problem here is the targeted intent. The author is using the snacks to get back at the coworkers for being rude. That crosses into inappropriate territory because it's not just about sharing food but using it as a tool for retaliation.\n\nAlso, the author is manipulating by knowing that a small indulgence can lead to giving up on their diet. This knowledge is being used against the coworkers, which is underhanded. Even if the coworkers are in a clique and rude, the author's response is not professional. The workplace should be respectful, and personal conflicts shouldn't be resolved through such means.\n\nBut some might argue that the author isn't forcing the coworkers to eat the food, just offering it. However, the author's encouragement (\"just a little piece won't hurt\") adds a layer of psychological manipulation. It's not just about availability but actively persuading them. That could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions, while not illegal, are likely inappropriate and unprofessional. Sabotaging someone's diet, even if it's just through tempting food, is a form of retaliation that can harm workplace relationships and morale. The answer here would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
