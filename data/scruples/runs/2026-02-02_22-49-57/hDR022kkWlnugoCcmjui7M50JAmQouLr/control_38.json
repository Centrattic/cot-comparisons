I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for bringing food to work to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation is that the author is dealing with a group of four women who've been rude to them since they started. The author thinks these women are dieting and brings in unhealthy snacks, encouraging them to break their diets by saying things like \"a little piece won't hurt.\" The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Intentionally undermining someone's dieting efforts might be seen as manipulative or mean. The author mentions that the coworkers are being rude, which could be a motive for retaliation. However, the author is using food as a tool to mess with their willpower, which could be considered a form of bullying or passive-aggressive behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also sharing food with others in the department, which seems positive. But the key issue is the intention to specifically target the dieting coworkers. Even if the author's actions make others appreciate the food, the targeted approach towards the four women is questionable. \n\nThe author might be seeking revenge for the mistreatment they've received, but that doesn't necessarily justify unethical behavior. The problem is that the author is using the health practices of others against them, which could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the coworkers are being rude, the author's method of response could harm their health goals or create a hostile work environment. \n\nAlso, the author's knowledge about dieting and willpower being fragile adds another layer. They're aware of the potential for relapse and are exploiting that, which makes the action more deliberate. While the author might feel justified in their actions due to the colleagues' behavior, it's important to consider whether the means are appropriate. \n\nIn many workplaces, creating a hostile environment through such tactics isn't acceptable. The author might not be directly rude, but their actions are undermining others' personal choices. The fact that others are enjoying the food doesn't absolve the author's targeted behavior. \n\nTherefore, the ethical stance here would likely be that the author is in the wrong. They're using manipulation and potentially contributing to a negative work atmosphere, even if their motivation stems from personal grievances.\n"
