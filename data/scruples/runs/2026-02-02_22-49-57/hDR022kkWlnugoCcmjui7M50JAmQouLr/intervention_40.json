I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is bringing in tasty food to work to try to mess with the diet of four women who are being rude to them. The coworkers are on a diet and eat salads, but the author brings in treats and encourages them to indulge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author mentions that these women are being unnecessarily rude and cliquish, and that one of them is excluding them from social events. The author's motivation seems to be revenge or payback for the mistreatment they've received. But the question is whether it's right or wrong to do so by bringing in food.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it okay to get revenge in this way? The author is targeting specific people's diets, which could be seen as a form of harassment or bullying. Even if the snacks are good for others, the intent here is to disrupt the diets of those four women. That's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author is being proactive in dealing with their own mistreatment, which might be justified if the women were truly at fault. But on the other hand, using others' health goals or personal struggles against them could be considered mean-spirited or passive-aggressive.\n\nAlso, the author is making a lot of assumptions. They say the women \"can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each,\" which is a judgment about their bodies that might not be accurate or appropriate. Everyone has their own body image, health, and personal goals. The author's comment about weight could come off as fat-shaming, which is definitely wrong regardless of the intent.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the author's actions affecting others. Since they're bringing food that's enjoyed by the rest of the department, maybe that's a positive side. But the targeted approach\u2014specifically trying to wreck the diets of these four women\u2014could create a hostile work environment. It's important to remember that the workplace should be respectful and inclusive. Even if the author is being playful, their actions might be perceived as malicious, especially if the women are already struggling with their diets and feel targeted.\n\nAnother angle: the author is using their own knowledge of dieting to manipulate others. That's a bit of a power play. If the author is in a position where they can influence the behavior of their coworkers, even if it's just through food, it's a form of bullying. The fact that others are appreciative of the snacks might not matter if the author is specifically targeting certain people with negative intent.\n\nSo, while the author might feel justified in seeking revenge for being treated poorly, the method they're using is problematic. It's not addressing the actual issues, like the exclusion from emails or the rudeness, but instead taking a personal shot at their health goals. This could be seen as inconsiderate and unprofessional. The right thing to do might be to address the mistreatment directly or through appropriate channels rather than resorting to undermining their diets.\n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because their actions are intended to harm or mock their coworkers' personal choices and could contribute to a negative workplace atmosphere. The assumption about their weight is also an issue. Even if the author is being nice to others, the intent here is malicious towards specific individuals.\n"
