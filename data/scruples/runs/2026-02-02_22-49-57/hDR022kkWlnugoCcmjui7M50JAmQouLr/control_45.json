I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is bringing in delicious food to the office specifically to mess with four coworkers' diets. The coworkers are known to be rude and cliquish, and the author feels targeted by them. The author is using their own dieting experience to undermine the coworkers' willpower by offering tempting snacks, which seems to be working as the coworkers end up eating them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author's motivation is revenge or retaliation against coworkers who've been unkind. But is it acceptable to take such actions? Even if the coworkers are mean, does that justify sabotaging their diets? Also, the author is sharing food with the rest of the department, which the others appreciate. So there's a positive aspect, but the intent here is to target specific people.\n\nAnother angle is consent and autonomy. The coworkers chose to diet, and the author is interfering with that choice. Even if the author is using manipulation by saying \"just a little piece won't hurt,\" it's a form of undermining their self-control. But the author isn't forcing them; they're just offering food. So it's a bit of a gray area. However, the intent is malicious because it's meant to wreck their diets as a form of revenge.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the group is being rude and exclusive, but the author's response is to play into their weaknesses (cravings) to make them eat. Is that a fair or ethical way to handle conflict? Maybe the author would consider it justified, but in terms of workplace ethics, it's probably not appropriate. The right approach would be to address the behavior through proper channels rather than personal sabotage.\n\nMoreover, the author is affecting others indirectly by making food available, which others are enjoying. But the main target is the four coworkers. Even if the author isn't directly forcing them, the intent is there, which could be seen as wrong. The question is whether the means of retaliation are acceptable. In most social contexts, intentionally undermining someone's efforts, even if they are mean, is considered wrong because it crosses into malicious intent.\n\nSo considering all these points, the author is likely in the wrong because they are using manipulation and sabotage to get back at their coworkers, which isn't a healthy or ethical way to handle the situation. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
