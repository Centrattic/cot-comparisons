I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author brings in delicious food to the office, knowing that some coworkers are on diets, to tempt them. The author's motivation is that these coworkers are being rude to them and are part of a clique that excludes them. The author is trying to get back at them by undermining their diets, while also sharing food with others in the office.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is intentionally targeting specific coworkers by using food as a means to disrupt their diets. This seems like a form of retaliation for the coworkers' behavior. However, the author is also sharing food with others, which is generally seen as a positive action.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a valid grievance about being treated poorly by these coworkers. Being excluded from emails and social functions can be stressful, and the author might feel a desire to respond in some way. But on the other hand, preying on their diets and willpower to cause them to give in could be seen as manipulative and unkind. It's a kind of passive-aggressive revenge, which might not be the healthiest approach.\n\nAnother angle is health. The author mentions that these coworkers are dieting, and by offering tempting foods, the author is potentially undermining their health goals. While the author might not be forcing them to eat the food, the act of offering it with the intention to tempt them crosses into manipulation. The author is using their knowledge of dieting strategies against others, which could be seen as exploiting a personal weakness.\n\nAdditionally, the author's actions could create a hostile work environment. Even if the author is sharing food with others, singling out specific coworkers for targeted behavior might exacerbate existing tensions. It's possible that the author's actions could lead to further conflict or escalate the rudeness from the coworkers.\n\nThe author justifies their actions by saying they are feeding others and that the coworkers are being rude. However, the intent here is crucial. The author's primary goal is to retaliate, not to genuinely share food. The fact that others benefit is a side effect. The key issue is whether the author is in the wrong for using food as a tool to get back at the coworkers.\n\nIn ethical terms, retaliation should be proportionate and constructive. The author's method is not resolving the underlying issue but instead creating a new problem. The correct approach would be to address the coworkers' behavior through appropriate channels, like talking to them directly or involving management if necessary. Using food as a weapon is a form of passive-aggressiveness that doesn't address the root cause of the problem and could be seen as unethical.\n\nMoreover, the author might be projecting their own dieting experiences onto the coworkers. While they mention fluctuating weight, it's important to recognize that dieting is a personal choice, and others have the right to make their own decisions without external interference, even if that interference is tempting them with food.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid reasons for feeling targeted, their method of retaliation is inappropriate. Intentionally undermining others' dietary choices with the intent to cause them to break their diets is not a constructive or ethical response. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
