I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing in food to disrupt their coworkers' diets. The scenario is that the author has a group of coworkers who are being rude to them, and they're trying to get back by sabotaging their dieting efforts. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is intentionally undermining their coworkers' health goals. Dieting is a personal choice, and while the coworkers might be making a choice to eat salads, the author is actively trying to make it harder for them. Even if the coworkers are being rude, is it right to retaliate by interfering with their diets? \n\nThen there's the aspect of the author's intent. They mention that they know how willpower can crumble, so they're using that knowledge to their advantage. But is this considered bullying or passive-aggressive behavior? It could be seen as a form of workplace harassment, especially if the coworkers are being targeted specifically because of their dieting. \n\nAlso, the author is bringing food for the entire department, which others appreciate. But the question is whether targeting specific coworkers to \"wreck their diets\" is acceptable. Even if others are happy, the specific intent here is to harm a particular group. \n\nWorkplace etiquette usually emphasizes respect and professionalism. Retaliation, even in the form of undermining someone's health choices, isn't typically considered appropriate. The author might have valid grievances about being excluded or mistreated, but the response here could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nOn the other hand, if the coworkers are being unkind and cliquish, the author might feel justified. But encouraging overeating or sabotaging their diet isn't a constructive way to handle workplace conflicts. There are better ways to address being excluded, like talking to HR or management, but instead, the author is taking a different approach. \n\nSo overall, even though the author has reasons for feeling upset, their actions are intentionally causing harm to others, which is unethical. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
