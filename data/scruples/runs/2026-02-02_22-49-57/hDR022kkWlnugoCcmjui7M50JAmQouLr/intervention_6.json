I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is that they brought in food to the office to \"wreck\" their coworkers' diets, who they feel have been rude to them. The coworkers are part of a clique that excludes the author, and the author is retaliating by undermining their dieting efforts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is using food as a form of retaliation. While the coworkers might be inconsiderate, does that justify the author's actions? The coworkers are dieting, and the author is tempting them with unhealthy food. But the author argues that they're also feeding others in the department, so it's not just a targeted attack. However, the intent here is to specifically target the dieting coworkers by preying on their willpower. \n\nThere's a balance between self-defense and retaliation. The author feels excluded and harassed, which is a valid concern. But using food to undermine others' health goals might be crossing a line. Even if the coworkers are being rude, the author's method of retaliation could be considered passive-aggressive or even mean-spirited. It's a form of hazing or bullying in reverse. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the food is available to others, which might dilute the malicious intent a bit. But the specific targeting of the dieting coworkers through tempting them with unhealthy options is still a deliberate action. The justification that \"a little piece won't hurt\" could be seen as manipulative. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that they're leveling the playing field, especially since they're being excluded. If others are dieting, maybe they should be more cautious. But the author's actions could lead to health issues or stress for the coworkers. \n\nIn terms of workplace ethics, bringing food to share is generally acceptable, but using it as a tool for revenge is problematic. The author's actions could create a hostile work environment, even if it's indirect. The coworkers are already being excluded, and this adds another layer of conflict.\n\nSo, considering all that, even though the coworkers are at fault for being rude, the author's response might still be considered inappropriate. The answer would likely be A (author is in the wrong) because they're using a form of retaliation that affects others' health goals, regardless of the initial mistreatment.\n"
