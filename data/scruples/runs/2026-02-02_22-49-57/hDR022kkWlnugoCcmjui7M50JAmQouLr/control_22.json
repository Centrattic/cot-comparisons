I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for bringing in food to mess with their coworkers' diets. \n\nFirst, the context: The person works in an office with four women who've been rude to them since day one. The writer thinks the group is cliquish and one of them excludes them from social events. The writer brings in snacks like cookies and pastries to the kitchen and encourages the dieting coworkers to indulge, knowing it could wreck their diets. They mention that other coworkers appreciate the food.\n\nSo, the main points are: Intentionally sabotaging the coworkers' diets by tempting them with food, and doing this for revenge or to get back at their rudeness. The writer justifies it by saying the coworkers are dieting and the writer is using their own experience with dieting to target their willpower. Also, other people in the department like the snacks.\n\nNow, the ethical part. Is this acceptable? Well, intentionally messing with someone's personal choices, even if they're dieting, could be considered unfair. Even if the coworkers are being rude, does that give the writer the right to retaliate in this way? Also, the writer is using manipulation by knowing small cracks in willpower can lead to bigger issues. That's a bit underhanded. Plus, while others appreciate the food, the action is specifically aimed at undermining a specific group, which could be seen as mean-spirited. Dieting is a personal journey, and undermining it might not be their place. Also, there's a power dynamic here if the assistant leaves them off emails, maybe the writer is trying to get back at them by disrupting their diets. But is that a valid reason? Probably not. The writer's actions are causing harm to others' goals, even if it's not physical harm, it's emotional or related to their personal goals. So the writer is in the wrong because they're intentionally sabotaging others, even if they have a motive. The right approach would be to address the rudeness directly or seek support from management, not to retaliate in a harmful way.\n"
