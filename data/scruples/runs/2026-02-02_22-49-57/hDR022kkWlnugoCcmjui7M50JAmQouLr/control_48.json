I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Ask Me Anything (AMA) is in the wrong. The scenario is about bringing in delicious food to the office to mess with coworkers' diets. The author mentions that a group of four women are rude to them, possibly because they're younger and make more money. The author brings in snacks like cookies and pastries, knowing these coworkers are dieting, and encourages them to have a little piece. They claim it's working because the women take the food. The author also feeds the rest of the department, and others appreciate the snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The main question is whether the author is justified in their actions. The author's coworkers are dieting, and the author is intentionally undermining their efforts. Even though the author might dislike the coworkers, is sabotaging their diets acceptable? The author's motivation is revenge or retaliation for being treated poorly. However, is that a valid reason to interfere with their health goals?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, intentionally sabotaging someone's diet could be seen as harmful. Diets are personal health choices, and undermining them might lead to negative health outcomes or stress. Even if the author believes the coworkers are being rude, using food as a weapon is crossing a line. The author is taking advantage of their own willpower knowledge to weaken the coworkers' resolve, which is manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is sharing food with the entire department, which is positive. But the targeted approach toward specific coworkers is problematic. The fact that others appreciate the snacks doesn't absolve the author from the negative intent towards the four women. The author's actions are a form of passive-aggressive retaliation, which isn't productive. It's possible the author is trying to get back at the women for being excluded from emails and being rude, but that doesn't justify the method.\n\nAlso, the author mentions not knowing the real reason for the rudeness. Maybe the coworkers have other valid reasons for their behavior. The author is making assumptions and acting on them. This could escalate conflicts in the workplace, leading to a toxic environment. The department might face issues with trust and teamwork if the author's actions become known.\n\nIn terms of workplace ethics, undermining coworkers' health goals isn't appropriate. The author should address the rudeness through proper channels, like talking to the coworkers directly or HR if necessary, rather than resorting to personal sabotage. The author's method is not a professional way to handle conflict. Even if the author feels wronged, the solution should be constructive, not damaging.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
