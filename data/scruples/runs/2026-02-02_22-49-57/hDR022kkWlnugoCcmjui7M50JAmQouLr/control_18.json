I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about bringing in delicious food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are a group of four women who've been rude to them, and the writer is trying to get back at them by tempting them with snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The writer's coworkers are dieting, eating salads, and the writer brings in cookies, pastries, etc., encouraging them to indulge. The writer claims they're doing this to retaliate against the coworkers' rudeness and possible exclusion (like being left off emails). They also mention that others in the department appreciate the food.\n\nNow, the ethical question here is whether the writer's actions are justified. The coworkers are dieting, and the writer is intentionally undermining that. But does that make the writer wrong? Well, the coworkers were being rude and cliquish, so maybe the writer feels justified. But is it right to take revenge by sabotaging their diets?\n\nI should consider the moral implications. Taking away someone's autonomy to make decisions about their health could be an issue. Even if the coworkers are being mean, the writer is directly interfering in their personal choices. Plus, the writer is admitting to using manipulation (like saying \"just a little piece won't hurt\") to influence them. That's a form of psychological manipulation, which is generally frowned upon.\n\nAlso, the writer mentions that others in the department like the food. So maybe they're not entirely malicious, but the targeting of specific coworkers is problematic. The writer's actions could be seen as a form of retaliation, which might not be the best way to handle workplace conflicts. Instead of addressing the rudeness directly or seeking a resolution through appropriate channels, they're taking a passive-aggressive approach.\n\nAnother angle is the workplace environment. Office relationships can be tricky. By bringing in food that's tempting for the dieting coworkers, the writer is creating a situation where they might feel pressure or guilt if they give in, especially if they know it's a targeted move. This could escalate tensions or lead to more conflict.\n\nHowever, there's also the argument that the writer is trying to find a way to cope with being mistreated. If the coworkers are indeed being unnecessarily rude and exclusionary, the writer might feel justified in seeking some form of retribution. But the method chosen\u2014undermining their diets\u2014might not be the healthiest or most constructive response.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the writer's actions are clearly intended to harm the coworkers' efforts to diet, which is a personal health choice. Even if the coworkers are acting poorly, the writer is crossing a line by interfering with their health decisions. There's also the potential for the writer's actions to be seen as petty or vindictive, which could damage their own reputation in the workplace.\n\nAdditionally, the writer mentions that the coworkers \"can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each,\" which might come off as judgmental. It's not the writer's place to decide that about others, and this could contribute to a hostile work environment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the writer's actions, while perhaps motivated by a desire for revenge, are ethically questionable. They're manipulating their coworkers' health choices and creating a potentially hostile environment. Even if the coworkers are being rude, the appropriate response would be to address the behavior directly, not to retaliate in a way that affects their personal lives. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
