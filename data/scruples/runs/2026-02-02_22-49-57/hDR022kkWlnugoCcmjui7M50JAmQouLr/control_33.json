I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation is that the author has a group of coworkers who are rude to them, maybe because of jealousy. The author brings in snacks like cookies and pastries, encouraging the coworkers to indulge, which seems to be working against their diets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's actions are justified. The coworkers are being rude, possibly excluding them. The author is retaliating by undermining their diets. But is that acceptable? Well, intentionally sabotaging someone's health goals isn't exactly kind. Even if there's a motive like being bullied, that doesn't make it right. The author is using others' potential weaknesses against them, which could be seen as mean-spirited.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that others in the department appreciate the snacks, so there's a positive side. But the main issue is targeting specific people. Even if it's indirect, it's still a form of revenge. The author might be feeling slighted, but the response is to use food as a weapon. That's probably not the best approach. It's a petty retaliation that can hurt others, even if it's not physically, maybe emotionally.\n\nAnother angle: the coworkers are on diets, and the author is tempting them. But maybe the author isn't considering that some people might have different health reasons for dieting. It's not their place to interfere, regardless of the reason for the conflict. The author's actions could lead to health issues or embarrassment for the coworkers if they fail their diets.\n\nAlso, the author is using manipulation, saying things like \"just a little piece won't hurt,\" which is a bit sneaky. That's not a healthy way to handle workplace conflicts. The proper approach would be to address the rudeness directly or seek HR help, not to take matters into their own hands.\n\nSo overall, even though the coworkers are being rude, the author's method of retaliation is inappropriate. It's a form of bullying in return, which isn't acceptable. The answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
