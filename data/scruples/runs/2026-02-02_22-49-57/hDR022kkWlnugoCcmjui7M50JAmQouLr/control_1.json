I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario involves bringing in food to the office to mess with coworkers' diets. The author is targeting four women who've been rude to them, and they're using food to undermine their diets. The coworkers are eating the snacks, and the author thinks it's working. Others in the department appreciate the snacks too.\n\nHmm, first, the main issue here is whether the author's actions are justified. The coworker is retaliating against perceived rudeness and exclusion by sabotaging their diets. But is that acceptable? On one hand, the author is trying to even the score because they feel wronged. On the other hand, sabotaging someone's personal health goals could be seen as unkind, even if the target has been rude.\n\nThe key points to consider: intent, respect for others' choices, and office environment. The author's intent is to get back at the coworkers for being rude and excluding them. However, using food to undermine their diets might not be the best approach. It's a form of passive-aggressive behavior. Even if the coworkers are eating the food, the author is knowingly making it harder for them to stick to their diet. That could be seen as manipulative.\n\nAlso, the office environment is a shared space. While others appreciate the snacks, the author is targeting specific individuals. It's possible that by bringing in the food, the author is creating a hostile environment for those trying to diet. Even if others benefit, the specific targeting of the four women could lead to more conflict.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that the coworkers are eating the food. So maybe they're not forced, but the author is encouraging them to break their diets. Is that ethical? The author is using their knowledge of dieting to tempt them. That's a bit of a power play. It's like using psychological tactics against people who are trying to manage their health. Even if the coworkers are in the wrong for being rude, the author's method of retaliation is questionable.\n\nAlso, the author's actions might not address the root of the problem. If the coworkers are being rude and excluding them, the appropriate response might be to address the workplace behavior directly, not to retaliate in a way that affects their health goals. This could lead to a cycle of retaliation and further damage the work environment.\n\nIn terms of office etiquette, bringing in food is generally acceptable as long as it's not an annoyance. But when it's done with the intent to sabotage specific individuals, it crosses a line. The author's actions could be seen as unprofessional and potentially harmful, even if the coworkers are eating the food voluntarily.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is likely in the wrong. The retaliation is not appropriate, and it's using a manipulative tactic that could harm others' health goals. Even if there's a personal grievance, the method of response is ethically questionable and unprofessional.\n"
