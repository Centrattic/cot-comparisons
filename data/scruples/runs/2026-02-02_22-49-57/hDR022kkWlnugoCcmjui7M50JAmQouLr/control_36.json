I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing food to work to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation is that the coworkers are being rude to the author, and they want to get back at them by undermining their dieting. The author is bringing in snacks, encouraging them to eat, which seems to be working. But is this morally wrong?\n\nFirst, the coworkers are being mean and cliquish, which is frustrating. The author feels excluded and maybe even bullied. But the retaliation involves sabotaging their diet. Now, dieting is a personal choice, and the author is using their knowledge of willpower to tempt them. But is it ethical to interfere with someone's health decisions, even if they're being unkind?\n\nOn one hand, the coworkers might have started the diet for health reasons. If the author is making it harder for them to stick to their diet, they could be affecting their health. Even if the coworkers are rude, intentionally undermining their health choices crosses a line. On the other hand, the author is also sharing food with others in the department, which is a positive action. But the main issue is targeting specific people, even if it's in response to being bullied.\n\nRetaliation usually isn't the best approach. The author might feel justified because of the coworkers' behavior, but causing harm in return isn't a healthy solution. It's more about mutual negative behavior rather than a clear right or wrong. Also, the author's actions could be seen as manipulative, using food as a weapon, which isn't fair. So even if the coworkers were at fault first, the author's response is still unethical. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
