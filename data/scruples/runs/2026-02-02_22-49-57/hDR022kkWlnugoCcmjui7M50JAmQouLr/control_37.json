I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing in food to sabotage their coworkers' diets. The situation involves a group of four women who are being rude to the author. The author has been bringing in snacks like cookies and pastries, encouraging the coworkers to indulge, which seems to be working because they're eating the food now. The author also mentions that other coworkers appreciate the snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is intentionally undermining the dieting efforts of these specific coworkers. While it's true that the coworkers are part of a group that's been rude to the author, using food as a form of retaliation might be crossing a line. It's a form of passive-aggressive behavior. The author is taking advantage of their willpower weaknesses, which isn't really fair. Dieting is a personal choice, and while others might find the snacks tempting, the author is directly targeting those who are dieting, which could be seen as harmful or manipulative.\n\nAlso, the author is doing this publicly in the kitchen, which affects other coworkers who might not be part of the conflict. Even though others appreciate the snacks, the primary intent here is to get back at the rude coworkers. That could create tension in the workplace and potentially lead to a hostile environment. The fact that the author is taking pleasure in seeing the coworkers eat the food they were trying to avoid adds a vindictive element.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel justified if they believe the coworkers are being unfairly rude. However, workplace conflicts should ideally be addressed through direct communication or HR, not through indirect sabotage. The author's actions might be a form of revenge, which is generally discouraged as it can escalate conflicts and harm professional relationships. So, even if the coworkers deserve it, the method of retaliation is questionable.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the workplace. If other coworkers are benefiting from the snacks, does that mitigate the issue? Not really, because the primary intent is malicious towards specific individuals. The author's justification that they're \"feeding\" the department doesn't erase the intent to undermine the others' diets. It's a classic case of a harmful action justified by a positive side effect, which is a weak defense.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are unethical and unprofessional. They're using a public resource (the kitchen) to target specific coworkers, which can be considered bullying or harassment. The right approach would be to address the rudeness directly, not through undermining their diets. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
