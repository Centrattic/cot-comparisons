I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation is that the author has a group of coworkers who are rude to them, possibly because of jealousy. The author brings in snacks to entice these coworkers to eat, knowing they're on diets. The main question is whether this is justified or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace ethics. Deliberately undermining someone's diet could be seen as a form of retaliation or bullying. Even if the author feels targeted, taking matters into their own hands by sabotaging others' health goals might cross a line. It's about respecting others' choices and privacy. The coworkers chose to diet, and the author is interfering with that decision, which might not be fair.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the author's motivation. They mention the others are part of a clique and have been rude. The author might feel they're getting even, but using food as a weapon isn't a professional response. It could lead to a hostile work environment. Also, the author is feeding others in the department, but that doesn't negate the negative impact on the specific coworkers they're targeting.\n\nAnother angle is the potential health implications. Encouraging others to eat against their diet could have health consequences, especially if they have medical conditions. Even if it's just a little, it's not the author's place to influence someone's health choices without their consent.\n\nHowever, the author might feel they're justified because of the rudeness they've experienced. But workplace conflicts should be addressed through proper channels, like speaking to HR or a manager, not through personal vendettas. The author's actions could backfire, leading to more conflict or disciplinary action.\n\nIn summary, while the coworkers' behavior is unkind, the author's response is inappropriate. It's a form of retaliation that can harm the workplace environment and isn't a professional way to handle conflict. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
