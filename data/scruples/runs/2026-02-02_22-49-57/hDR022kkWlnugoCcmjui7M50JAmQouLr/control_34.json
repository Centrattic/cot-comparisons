I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for bringing food to work to mess with their coworkers' diets. The background is that the author has had a bad experience with four women in the office who've been rude since day one, maybe because of jealousy over being younger and making more money. The author starts bringing in unhealthy snacks knowing these women are dieting, trying to break their willpower by tempting them with cookies, pastries, etc. They mention that others in the department also enjoy the food.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are wrong. The key points here are intent and the impact. The author's intention is to purposefully wreck the coworkers' diets as revenge for being rude. That's a form of retaliation, which is generally not considered appropriate. Even if the coworkers are being mean, using food to undermine their dieting efforts is a passive-aggressive way of getting back at them. \n\nHowever, the author also mentions that others in the department appreciate the food. So, the action isn't entirely malicious because it benefits others too. But the specific targeting of the four women is the issue. The author is exploiting their dieting habits to make them feel bad or give in, which is a form of emotional manipulation. It's also a bit of a power play, using food as a weapon. \n\nAnother angle: the coworkers are adults and can make their own choices. Even if they're dieting, they have free will. The author isn't forcing them to eat the food; they choose to take it. But the fact that the author is deliberately trying to weaken their willpower by knowing how cravings work adds a manipulative element. It's like preying on their weaknesses for personal satisfaction or revenge.\n\nAlso, the office is a shared space, so bringing food is a common thing. But when it's done with the specific intent to target certain people, it crosses into unethical territory. The author's actions could be seen as fostering a toxic work environment, making the targeted coworkers feel attacked or undermined. Even if others enjoy it, the negative intent towards the four women is problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might feel they're justified due to the coworkers' rudeness, intentionally undermining someone's diet as revenge is not an appropriate response. There are better ways to address workplace conflicts, like communicating directly or seeking HR assistance. The author's method is harmful and unprofessional, even if the outcome is that others enjoy the food. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
