I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves bringing food to the office to disrupt coworkers' diets, specifically targeting a group of women who are reportedly rude and cliquish. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is intentionally undermining the diets of their coworkers. While the coworkers might be unfriendly, sabotaging their efforts to diet could be seen as a form of retaliation. Even if the coworkers are difficult, using others' health goals against them might not be the right approach.\n\nNext, the office environment. The author mentions that they're feeding the entire department, and others appreciate the snacks. However, the question is about the targeted coworkers. The author is specifically trying to mess with their diets, which could be viewed as a personal vendetta. It's not just about sharing snacks; it's about using food as a weapon against people they dislike.\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. The coworkers chose to diet, and the author is interfering with their choices. Even if the author knows about dieting, it's their choice to participate in it. The author's actions could lead to health issues or other negative consequences, which they might not be considering.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels targeted and neglected by the coworkers. They might feel justified in seeking revenge, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. Office politics can be tricky, but resorting to undermining others' health goals might lead to more conflict and could be seen as unprofessional.\n\nThe author's method of bringing food for everyone but targeting specific coworkers' diets introduces an element of manipulation. While others enjoy the snacks, the intention behind the action is malicious towards a specific group. This could create a hostile work environment and damage relationships further.\n\nIn conclusion, even if the author has grievances, intentionally sabotaging others' diets is crossing a line. The right approach would be to address the workplace dynamics through appropriate channels, not through undermining personal health choices. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
