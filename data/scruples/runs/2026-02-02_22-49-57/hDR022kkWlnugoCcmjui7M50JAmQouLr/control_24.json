I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation is that the author has a group of coworkers who are rude to them, maybe due to jealousy. The coworkers are dieting, so the author brings in snacks and encourages them to indulge, leading the coworkers to eat the food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions. The author is intentionally undermining the coworkers' diets. Even if the coworkers are being rude, is it right to take revenge by messing with their diet? The author mentions they're doing it to get back at them, which is a form of retaliation. But is that justified?\n\nAlso, the author is sharing food with the whole department, not just targeting the specific coworkers. However, their intent is to affect those dieters. The question is whether this is acceptable. On one hand, it's a harmless prank, but on the other, it's manipulating others' health goals. People have the right to choose their diet, and the author is influencing that choice, even if it's through temptation. \n\nBut the coworkers started the rudeness, so the author might feel they have a reason. However, workplace behavior should be professional. Even if the coworkers are unkind, the author's response could be seen as unprofessional or even bullying. Also, the author's justification is that they have experience with dieting and know how willpower can break, which adds a manipulative aspect. \n\nAnother angle: the company's policy. If the office has rules about bringing food, but the author isn't breaking those, maybe. But if it's a shared kitchen, others can eat the food too, so the author is making a judgment call on who should eat it. \n\nIn terms of ethics, is it okay to retaliate in the workplace? Probably not. The best approach is to address the rudeness directly or through HR, not personal sabotage. The author's actions might be seen as petty or harmful, even if they're not illegal. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because they're using food to undermine others' health goals in retaliation for personal grievances. The answer should be A.\n"
