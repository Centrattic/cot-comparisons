I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation is that the author has a group of four women who are being rude to them. The author wants to get back at them by making it harder for them to stick to their diets by bringing in tempting snacks. The author mentions that others in the department appreciate the food, so it's not just targeting the four women, but the author is specifically trying to affect those four.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author's coworkers are making an effort to diet, and the author is deliberately undermining that. Even if there's a motive like being rude to the author, is it right to interfere with someone else's health choices? The author is using their own food to tempt others, which might not be healthy. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author is retaliating against being treated poorly. But on the other hand, encouraging others to eat against their diet could be seen as harmful. It's a form of manipulation or sabotage. Also, the author is using others' willpower issues against them, which might not be fair. Even if the coworkers are being rude, the author's response could be considered unprofessional or crossing a line. The fact that others in the department like the snacks doesn't negate the targeted behavior towards the four women.\n\nAdditionally, the author is taking advantage of their knowledge about dieting to exploit their coworkers' vulnerabilities. This might not be ethical, even if the coworkers are being unkind. The workplace should ideally be a respectful environment where such personal vendettas aren't acted upon. The author might be in the wrong because they're using a harmful method to retaliate instead of addressing the issue directly or through appropriate channels.\n"
