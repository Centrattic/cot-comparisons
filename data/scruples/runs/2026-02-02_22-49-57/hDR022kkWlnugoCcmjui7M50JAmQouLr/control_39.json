I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The person is dealing with a group of coworkers who are being rude to them, and they're retaliating by providing tempting foods to break the coworkers' diets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and social dynamics here. The author mentions that the four women are being unnecessarily rude and exclusionary. They were left off emails and the coworkers are shrugging it off, thinking it's jealousy. The author is trying to fight back by undermining their diets. But is that justified?\n\nOn one hand, the author is responding to bullying or at least perceived hostility. They might feel like they're standing up for themselves. But on the other hand, deliberately sabotaging someone's diet could be seen as a mean-spirited act, even if the intention is to get back at the colleagues. Plus, the author is affecting others in the department who aren't part of the conflict by providing food, which might be a positive side effect, but the primary intent is malicious.\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent and autonomy. The coworkers are trying to diet, and the author is intentionally making it harder for them. Even if the author thinks it's harmless, it could be considered manipulative. The line between playful teasing and actual sabotage is thin here. Also, the author is using their own past dieting experiences to justify the actions, but that doesn't necessarily make it right.\n\nAnother angle is the workplace environment. Office politics can be tricky. If the author is trying to gain favor with others by being the food provider while undermining a few, it could create more division. The author might be seen as the antagonist if the coworkers feel their dieting efforts are being undermined without their consent.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the action is intentional harm towards others, even if it's not physical. The author is using food as a tool for revenge, which might be considered inconsiderate or even unprofessional. Even if the coworkers are rude, the author's response could escalate tensions rather than resolve them. A more constructive approach might have been to address the rudeness directly or seek support from management or HR, rather than engaging in a counterproductive vendetta.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer would likely be A, meaning the author is in the wrong. Their actions, while a reaction to perceived mistreatment, are harmful and unprofessional, and there are better ways to handle workplace conflicts.\n"
