I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is bringing in delicious food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are a group of four women who've been rude to the author since they started a year ago. The author heard they're cliquish, and one even leaves them off emails for social events. The author brings cookies, pastries, etc., into the kitchen, and when coworkers hesitate, they say things like \"just a little piece won't hurt.\" The author claims this is working because the coworkers take the food. They also mention feeding the whole department (about 20 people), and others are appreciative.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down. First, the author is taking revenge for being treated poorly. They're using food to undermine the coworkers' diets. But is that justified? On one hand, the coworkers are being rude and exclusive, which is not nice. On the other hand, the author's actions could be seen as manipulative or even bullying in return. \n\nBut wait, the author is also providing food for the entire department. So maybe they're not just targeting those coworkers. But the main issue is the intent: they're doing it on purpose to wreck the coworkers' diets. That's where it might be problematic. Even if the coworkers are rude, intentionally undermining someone's health goals could be considered harmful. Also, diets are personal choices. If someone is trying to diet, the author is using psychological tactics to weaken their willpower. That could be seen as crossing a line, even if the coworkers are difficult.\n\nBut then, the author is also part of the department and might feel justified in retaliating against the exclusion and rudeness. However, the method of retaliation is questionable. Maybe the author should address the coworker's behavior directly instead of using food as a weapon. Also, the author's actions could lead to health issues if the coworkers overindulge. It's not just about diets; it's about potentially making them eat in a way that's unhealthy.\n\nAnother angle: the author is using their knowledge of willpower weaknesses to exploit others. That's a form of manipulation. Even if the coworkers are being jerks, the author's approach is not a healthy or constructive way to deal with the situation. It might also create a hostile work environment. The fact that the author is feeding others doesn't negate the negative intent towards specific coworkers. \n\nIn summary, while the coworkers' behavior is bad, the author's method of retaliation is manipulative and could be harmful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because their actions are intentionally undermining others' health goals and using psychological tactics to do so, which isn't a healthy response to workplace conflict.\n"
