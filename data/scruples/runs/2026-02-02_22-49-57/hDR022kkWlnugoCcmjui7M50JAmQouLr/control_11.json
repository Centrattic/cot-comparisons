I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the person bringing in food to their office to mess with coworkers' diets, specifically targeting a group of women they feel are being rude to them. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is bringing in snacks like cookies, pastries, and cheese platters to the office kitchen. Their coworkers are on a diet, eating salads, and the author is trying to tempt them with these treats. The motivation here is revenge or retaliation because the coworkers are being rude to the author. The author mentions that they're not targeting the entire company, just this group, and that others are appreciative of the snacks.\n\nNow, considering office etiquette and ethics. Even if the coworkers were being rude, sabotaging their diets by providing tempting food might not be the right approach. The author's actions could be seen as a form of retaliation, which isn't appropriate in a professional setting. It's important to address conflicts through communication or HR, not through pranks or sabotage.\n\nAlso, the author is taking advantage of others' willpower struggles. Dieting is personal, and using that against someone isn't fair. Even if the author feels wronged, the method of response is problematic. It could lead to a hostile work environment and might be considered unprofessional or even bullying.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that they're feeding the rest of the department, but that doesn't justify targeting specific individuals. The line between sharing food and using it as a weapon is crossed here. The author's actions are intentional and mean-spirited towards those coworkers, which is against workplace conduct norms.\n\nThe author's justification is that the coworkers are being rude, but that doesn't make their actions right. It's possible that the coworkers have their own reasons for their behavior, but the author's response is not a constructive solution. They should seek to resolve the conflict through proper channels instead of resorting to underhanded tactics.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because their actions are retaliatory, unprofessional, and potentially harmful to the work environment. The correct answer is A.\n"
