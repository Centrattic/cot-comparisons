I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether they're at fault for bringing in food to wreck their coworkers' diets. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is dealing with a group of four women who are being rude to them. The author brings in snacks like cookies, pastries, and cheese platters, knowing these coworkers are on diets. They encourage them to eat by saying things like \"just a little piece won't hurt.\" The goal seems to be to undermine the diets of these coworkers. However, the author also mentions that other coworkers are benefiting and are appreciative.\n\nSo, the main issue here is intentional sabotage of others' diets. The author is using food as a weapon to get back at the women who are being rude to them. But is that justified?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, intentionally undermining someone's health goals, even if they're being mean, could be seen as unethical. Dieting is a personal choice, and while the author might feel targeted, retaliating by tempting others to break their diets crosses a line. It's a form of passive-aggressive behavior that affects others negatively, possibly leading to unhealthy habits or guilt.\n\nAlso, bringing food to the office is common and usually a positive thing, but the author is doing it with malicious intent towards specific people. The fact that others are appreciative doesn't excuse the targeted sabotage. The author's actions could be seen as manipulative, using others' willpower weaknesses against them, which isn't a fair or respectful response to rudeness.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers were being rude first. But even in that case, the author's response is not constructive. Retaliation isn't a healthy way to handle workplace conflicts. Instead of helping the situation, the author is creating a hostile environment, which could lead to further issues.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
