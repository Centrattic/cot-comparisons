I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about bringing in food to the office and using it to mess with coworkers' diets. The user is asking if they're \"in the wrong,\" so we need to consider both the actions and the context.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the four women are being unnecessarily rude to them. They started this behavior from day one, and it's been going on for a year. The author feels excluded, like they're being left off emails for social functions. The assistant for the boss is part of this group, and others think she might be jealous because the author is younger and makes more money. So, the author is dealing with some workplace hostility here.\n\nNow, the author is bringing in snacks like cookies, pastries, and cheese platters to the kitchen. They're doing this with the intention of wrecking the diets of these four women. The author uses phrases like \"just a little piece won't hurt,\" which is probably meant to tempt them. They've noticed that the coworkers are taking the food, and the author thinks this is working. Also, the author is feeding other department members, and they're appreciative.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's motivation (revenge or retaliation against rude coworkers), the method (deliberately undermining their diets), and the impact (others are benefiting from the food, but the targeted coworkers are being affected).\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it okay to retaliate against others by undermining their personal choices (like dieting)? Even if the coworkers are being rude, does that justify interfering with their diets? The author might feel that they're getting back at them, but is that a valid reason? Also, is it ethical to use food as a weapon in the workplace? What if the coworkers' diets are for health reasons? The author might be violating their boundaries, even if others are happy with the food.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also sharing food with others, which is generally a positive thing. Maybe the author is trying to cope with the bullying in a passive-aggressive way. But is that acceptable? The act of intentionally trying to wreck someone's diet could be seen as malicious, even if the author thinks they're just being playful or using their own knowledge about diets. The coworkers aren't directly harming the author beyond being rude, so the retaliation might be disproportionate.\n\nWorkplace dynamics are tricky. If the coworkers are indeed creating a hostile environment, the proper step would be to address it through appropriate channels, like HR or a manager, rather than personal retaliation. The author's actions might be seen as unprofessional or even bullying in return. Even if others are benefiting, the intent here is to target specific individuals, which crosses a line.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because their actions are a form of retaliation that undermines others' personal health choices and could be considered unprofessional or even harmful. The fact that others are happy with the food doesn't negate the targeted intent against the four women. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
