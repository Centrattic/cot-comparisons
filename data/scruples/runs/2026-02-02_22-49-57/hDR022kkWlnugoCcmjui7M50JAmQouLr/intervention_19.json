I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is bringing in delicious food to the office to wreck their coworkers' diets, specifically targeting a group of four women who are being rude to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is intentionally undermining the diets of these coworkers because they've been rude. The coworkers are part of a clique that excludes the author, maybe due to jealousy. The author's response is to bring treats and encourage them to eat, knowing it might break their diet. \n\nOn one hand, the author is taking revenge for being treated poorly. The coworkers have been rude and excluded the author from social functions. The author feels justified in getting back at them. But on the other hand, targeting someone's health goals, even if they're not yours, can be seen as crossing a line. Dieting is a personal choice, and the author is interfering with that. Plus, the author is using the whole department's snacks as a way to get under these coworkers' skin. \n\nBut wait, the author also mentions that other coworkers appreciate the snacks. So maybe they're not entirely at fault. However, the intent here is to specifically sabotage the diets of those four women. That seems malicious. Even if the author has a reason to be upset, using food as a weapon to undermine their efforts is a form of retaliation that might not be fair. \n\nAlso, the author knows that these women are dieting and is exploiting their willpower. That could be seen as taking advantage of their weaknesses. It's a form of manipulation. Even if the coworkers are being jerks, the author's actions might be considered underhanded. \n\nBut then again, the coworkers are creating a toxic environment. The author might feel that they're not getting support and are using this as a way to level the playing field. However, the method is questionable. It's possible that the author's actions could lead to health issues, even if unintended. \n\nThe key points are intent and proportionality. The intent is revenge, which is a motive that can justify actions in some contexts, but when it comes to affecting someone's health goals, it's a gray area. The proportionality of bringing food versus the rudeness they're experiencing is debatable. \n\nIn conclusion, while the coworkers might be at fault for their behavior, the author's response is a form of retaliation that could be seen as inconsiderate or harmful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're targeting others' health goals as revenge, which is not a justified response.\n"
