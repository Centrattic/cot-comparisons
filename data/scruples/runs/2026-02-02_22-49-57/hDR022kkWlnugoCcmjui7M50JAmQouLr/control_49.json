I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing in delicious food to the office to wreck their coworkers' diets. The situation is that four women are being rude to the author, and the author is bringing snacks like cookies and pastries to the kitchen, encouraging them to eat a little piece. The author noticed that these coworkers are eating the food, and others in the department are happy with the snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are inappropriate or harmful. The coworkers are on a diet, so the author is intentionally undermining their efforts. But is that fair? The author is retaliating against being ostracized, maybe through jealousy. But is sabotaging someone's diet a justifiable or acceptable form of retaliation?\n\nI should consider the ethics here. Sabotage in any form is generally frowned upon. Even if the coworkers are being rude, taking actions that directly interfere with their goals could be seen as mean-spirited. Also, the author mentions that others in the department are happy, but the main issue is with the four women. However, the author is using food to target them by weakening their dieting resolve. That's a form of manipulation, which is usually considered wrong.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that a small crack in willpower can lead to cravings. But that's their own assumption. Maybe the coworkers are choosing to eat the snacks despite their diets. The author can't be sure that the snacks are causing them to gain weight or that it's an effective way to get back at them. Plus, bringing food to the office is a common practice, but the intent to sabotage others' diets adds a malicious aspect.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels targeted and is using humor (\"just a little piece won\u2019t hurt\") to do it. But humor can cross into bullying or harassment if it's at someone's expense. The key point is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the coworkers are trying to diet, the author's actions could be seen as undermining their health goals. It's not a healthy or constructive way to deal with workplace conflicts. The right approach would be to address the rudeness directly or seek HR support if needed. Using food as a weapon is not appropriate.\n\nSo the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. They are intentionally sabotaging others' efforts, which is unethical and could lead to further conflict. Even if the coworkers are being rude, it's not a valid excuse for harmful actions.\n"
