I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author bringing in food to their office to try to derail their coworkers' diets, specifically targeting a group of four women they find rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is intentionally undermining others' health goals. While the coworkers might be unfriendly, sabotaging their diets seems like a form of revenge or retaliation. The author's actions could be seen as manipulative and harmful, even if they're providing food for others. \n\nThe coworkers are making the author feel excluded, which is a valid issue, but the response of using food to mess with their diets isn't a healthy or appropriate solution. It's a passive-aggressive approach that affects not just the target coworkers but possibly others who are dieting too. Plus, the author mentions that others in the department appreciate the snacks, but that doesn't excuse targeting specific individuals. \n\nAlso, there's a question of consent and respect. The author isn't asking if the coworkers want to eat the food; they're using psychological tactics to weaken their willpower. This could lead to guilt or backlash later if the coworkers realize it's intentional. \n\nIn terms of office etiquette, bringing in treats is common, but doing so with the intent to sabotage someone's diet crosses a line. The author's actions might be seen as unprofessional and fostering a negative work environment. \n\nEven if the coworkers are cliquish and rude, the best approach would be to address the behavior directly or seek HR support if necessary. Sabotage, even in the form of food, isn't a constructive or ethical response. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are inconsiderate, unethical, and likely to exacerbate workplace tensions. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
