I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is bringing in delicious food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. These coworkers are a group of four women who have been unnecessarily rude to them since they started a year ago. The author heard they're cliquish, and one is the boss's assistant who leaves them off emails for social events. The author suspects jealousy because they're younger and make more money. \n\nNow, the author is intentionally tempting these coworkers with snacks like cookies, pastries, and cheese platters, knowing that even a small crack in willpower can lead to giving up their diets. They mention that it's been working for three weeks, as they see the women taking platefuls. But they also note that they're feeding about 20 other coworkers who seem appreciative.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? Let's break this down. The author's primary motivation seems to be retaliation against the coworkers' rudeness and exclusion. They're using food as a tool to undermine the diets, which might be a form of revenge. But they also say that others in the department benefit from the snacks. \n\nOn one hand, the author is taking action to address being treated poorly. They might feel that the coworkers are being unfair, so this is a way to even the playing field. On the other hand, intentionally sabotaging someone's diet, even if it's through tempting them, could be seen as manipulative. The coworkers are making their own choices to eat the food, so maybe the author isn't directly forcing them. However, the author is aware that this could harm the coworkers' health goals and is using that knowledge to their advantage.\n\nAlso, the author is contributing to a positive environment by providing snacks for others, which is a good thing. But the intent here is specifically to target these four women. Even if others benefit, the malicious intent towards the specific group might make it wrong. \n\nAnother angle: dieting is a personal choice, and while the author might be undermining it, the coworkers are adults capable of making their own decisions. The author is providing food, but not pressuring them to eat it beyond a friendly nudge. However, if the coworkers are trying to maintain a diet and the author is actively trying to derail that, even if it's a small thing, it's a form of bullying or revenge. \n\nAlso, the author's own weight fluctuates, so maybe they have some understanding of dieting struggles. But that doesn't necessarily justify their actions. It's possible they're projecting their own experiences onto others. \n\nIn terms of ethics, is it wrong to retaliate against someone by exploiting their weaknesses? The coworkers are being rude and exclusive, and the author is responding in kind. This could be seen as a tit-for-tat scenario, but it's not resolving the underlying issue. Instead, it's creating a new problem. \n\nWorkplace relationships are important, and if the author is fostering a toxic environment by playing pranks or undermining colleagues, that could harm the workplace. Even if others appreciate the snacks, the targeted behavior towards the four women might be creating a hostile work environment for them. \n\nMoreover, the assistant's exclusion from emails is a separate issue. Maybe the author should address that directly instead of using food as a weapon. The author might be looking for a way to cope with the stress of being excluded and rudely treated, but the method they've chosen could be counterproductive. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions are a form of retaliation. While the coworkers are in the wrong for being rude, the author's response might also be in the wrong because it's a form of bullying or undermining others' health goals. Even if the author feels justified, intentionally sabotaging someone else's efforts, even in a playful way, can be seen as unethical or unprofessional. The fact that others benefit from the snacks is a positive side, but the specific targeting of the four women is problematic. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
