I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to wreck their coworkers' diets. The author is dealing with some coworkers who are rude to them. These coworkers started dieting together, eating salads, and the author is trying to undermine their diets by bringing in treats. The author feels justified because they're also feeding others and maybe getting back at the rude coworkers.\n\nHmm, the main points to consider here are the ethics of targeting specific coworkers, the impact on others, and the justification given. The author is directly interfering with the diets of people who are being rude to them. But is that a valid reason to retaliate? Also, while others might enjoy the snacks, the author's intention is specifically to mess with the diets of those four women. That seems like a personal vendetta.\n\nThe question is whether this action is wrong. The answer likely hinges on intent and respect for others' choices. Encouraging someone to eat against their diet could be seen as undermining their health goals, even if it's for revenge. Plus, using food in a shared space might affect others who aren't part of the targeted group. Even if the author is feeding others, the main goal is to target specific people, which is manipulative.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions are probably in the wrong because they're using food as a tool for revenge, which isn't respectful or ethical, even if others benefit indirectly.\n"
