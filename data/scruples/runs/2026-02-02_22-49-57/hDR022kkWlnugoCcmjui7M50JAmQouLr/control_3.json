I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for bringing in food to mess with their coworkers' diets.\n\nFirst, the context: the author has four coworkers who are rude to them. The coworkers are on a diet, eating salads. The author brings in snacks like cookies and pastries, encourages them to indulge a bit, and seems to be succeeding in making them eat the snacks. The author mentions that others in the department also enjoy the food. They don't know exactly why the coworkers are being rude but suspect jealousy over age and salary.\n\nSo, is this the author's fault? Well, intentionally undermining someone's diet could be seen as mean or manipulative. Even if the coworkers are being rude, retaliating by tempting them to break their diet might not be the right approach. It's a form of passive aggression. The author is using food as a weapon, which could be considered cruel. Also, the author is affecting others in the department who are on the diet, but also feeding everyone else. But the main issue is targeting those specific coworkers. Even if others benefit, the intention is to mess with the diets of the rude ones. That's crossing a line. So the answer is probably A.\n"
