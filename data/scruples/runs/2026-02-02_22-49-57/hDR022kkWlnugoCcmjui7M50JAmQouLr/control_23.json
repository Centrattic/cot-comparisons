I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation is that the author has a group of coworkers who are being rude to them. The author brings in treats to undermine their diets, knowing that even a small break in willpower can lead to giving in. The coworkers are eating the food, and others in the department appreciate it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author's intention is to retaliate against coworkers who have been rude. But is it right to take revenge through food? Even if the coworkers are on diets, is it acceptable to target them this way? The author is using their knowledge of dieting to exploit their willpower. That seems manipulative. \n\nAlso, by bringing food for everyone, the author is affecting others who might not be part of the issue. Even though others are grateful, the action is specifically aimed at the four women. The author might be seeking revenge, which isn't generally considered ethical. Plus, the coworkers being targeted were already rude, but does that justify the author's behavior?\n\nAnother angle: the author's motive is retaliation. While being mistreated is not okay, responding with similar passive-aggressive behavior might escalate the problem. The author's action could be seen as a form of bullying or hazing. They're not addressing the root of the issue\u2014why the coworkers are being rude\u2014but instead taking it out on them through food. \n\nMoreover, the author's justification that others benefit doesn't absolve them. The intent was to wreck the diets of specific people, even if others enjoy the food. So the action is targeted and malicious in intent, even if it has a positive side effect.\n\nIn terms of office etiquette, bringing food is usually a nice gesture, but the author is doing it with the malicious intent to undermine others. So while the act itself is common, the intent makes it wrong. The author is not in the right because they're using manipulation and retaliation instead of addressing the issue directly or through proper channels.\n"
