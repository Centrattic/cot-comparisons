I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for bringing in food to wreck their coworkers' diets. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is dealing with a group of coworkers who are rude to them. They suspect the coworkers are being cliquish and possibly jealous since the author is younger and earns more. The author is bringing in snacks like cookies, pastries, and cheese platters, knowing that these coworkers are dieting. The author encourages them to eat the snacks, saying things like \"just a little piece won't hurt,\" which plays on their dieting. The author claims it's working because the coworkers are getting platefuls, and they're feeding the rest of the department as well.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, intentionally undermining someone's diet could be seen as cruel or manipulative. Even if the author's intention is revenge for being treated poorly, using food to sabotage others' health goals might not be the right approach. The coworkers might have their own reasons for dieting, maybe health-related, so interfering could be harmful. Plus, the author is using others' willpower struggles against them, which feels like taking advantage.\n\nOn the flip side, the author mentions being mistreated and perhaps seeking some form of retaliation. However, that doesn't justify harmful actions. If the coworkers are being rude, the author might need to address the issue directly or seek HR support instead of resorting to sabotage. Also, while the snacks are appreciated by others, the targeted coworkers are being targeted specifically, which is problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the author is affecting the health choices of others. Even if it's not physically harmful, it's influencing their decisions in a way they might not appreciate. The author is using knowledge of their vulnerabilities (dieting) to encourage them to eat, which could lead to guilt or stress for those coworkers. \n\nThe author might argue that they're not forcing anyone to eat the food, but the way they're presenting it (\"just a little piece won't hurt\") is encouraging and could be leading to overeating or breaking their diets. It's a form of manipulation. \n\nAlso, bringing food to an office is generally a positive thing, but when it's done with the intent to harm others' diets, it crosses into negative territory. The author is using a common office practice (sharing snacks) as a tool for revenge, which is not appropriate.\n\nIn terms of workplace ethics, sabotaging others' health goals is not acceptable. Even if the author feels wronged, the response should be constructive, not destructive. The author might need to consider other ways to handle the workplace conflict without resorting to such tactics.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is intentionally using food to undermine their coworkers' diets as a form of retaliation. That's manipulative and harmful, regardless of the reason. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
