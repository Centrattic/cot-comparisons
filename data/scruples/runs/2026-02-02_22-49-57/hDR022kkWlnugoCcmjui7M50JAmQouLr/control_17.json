I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing in food to wreck their coworkers' diets. The situation is that the author has four coworkers who are rude to them, and these coworkers are dieting. The author brings in snacks and encourages them to eat, which seems to be working because the coworkers are now eating the food. The author also mentions feeding the rest of the department, and others are appreciative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author's coworkers are trying to diet, and the author is intentionally undermining their efforts. Even if the author feels targeted by the coworkers, is it right to retaliate by messing with their diet? On the other hand, the author is also providing snacks for the whole department, which others like. But the main issue is targeting specific people who are dieting.\n\nThe author's motivation is revenge for being treated rudely. However, using others' dietary goals as a weapon seems underhanded. Even if the coworkers are being unkind, the author's action might be crossing a line. The problem is that the author's method could affect others' health goals and might not be fair. Also, the author is taking advantage of their knowledge about willpower and cravings, which is a bit manipulative.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that the department is appreciative, but the specific coworkers in question are the ones being targeted. The assistant's exclusion from emails might be a bigger issue, but the author is handling it by undermining the coworkers' diets. It's possible that there's a better way to address the rudeness without causing harm. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions are manipulative and could be considered wrong, even if the intent is retaliation. The right answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
