I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets.\n\nFirst, the context: The author has four coworkers who are rude to them. The author thinks these coworkers are being cliquish and maybe jealous because the author is younger and makes more money. The coworkers are dieting, eating salads for lunch. The author brings in high-calorie snacks like cookies, pastries, and cheese platters, encouraging the coworkers to eat them by saying things like \"just a little piece won't hurt.\" The author's goal seems to be to undermine the coworkers' diets, using their own experience with dieting to exploit their willpower. However, the author also mentions that the rest of the department (around 20 people) are eating the snacks and are appreciative.\n\nNow, analyzing the situation. The key points here are intent and the impact of the actions. The author's intention is to intentionally sabotage the coworkers' diets, which is a personal vendetta against people who are already being rude to them. Even if the author has a reason to be upset (being excluded from emails, rudeness), taking revenge by undermining someone's health goals is not a socially acceptable response. \n\nHowever, the author is also feeding others in the department, which is a positive aspect. But the primary action is directed at the specific coworkers who are causing the author distress. The question is whether the author's actions cross a line into being in the wrong.\n\nEthically, sabotaging someone's health goals, even in retaliation for rudeness, is generally considered wrong. It's a form of passive-aggressive behavior that can harm others' well-being. The author is using manipulation (encouraging them to break their diets) which is unethical. Even if the coworkers are rude, the response should not involve undermining their health. \n\nMoreover, the author's action might not be directly targeted at the coworkers but is a general food offering, which others also enjoy. However, the author's intent was specifically to affect those dieting coworkers. So even though others benefit, the targeted sabotage is the issue.\n\nIn terms of office etiquette, bringing food is usually a positive thing, but when it's done with the intention to harm others' diets, it's problematic. The author is using a social norm (sharing snacks) as a cover for a malicious intent. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because the intentional sabotage of others' diets, despite the positive side effect of feeding others, is an unethical action that crosses the line from a petty revenge to something harmful.\n"
