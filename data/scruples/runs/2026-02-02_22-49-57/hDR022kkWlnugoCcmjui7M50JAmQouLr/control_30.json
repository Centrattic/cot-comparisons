I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Ask Me Anything (AITA) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about bringing food to work specifically to undermine coworkers' diets, especially a group of four women who are reportedly being rude to them.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author mentions that these coworkers are part of a clique and have been unfriendly since day one. The author's motive here seems to be revenge or getting back at them for their behavior. They bring in treats like cookies and pastries, encouraging others to eat them, knowing it might mess up the dieters' plans. The author also notes that the rest of the department is happy with the snacks, so it's not entirely malicious towards everyone.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is the author justified in their actions? The coworkers were being rude, so maybe they felt targeted. However, retaliating by undermining their diets could be seen as petty. It's a form of sabotage. Even if the author is sharing with others, the intention to specifically target this group might make it wrong. Also, the author is using their own willpower knowledge to manipulate others, which could be considered underhanded.\n\nEthically, is it okay to take revenge in this way? While the coworkers were rude, the author's response might be crossing a line. It's important to consider intent versus action. The action here affects others beyond the target group, even if they like the snacks, but the primary intent is to harm the group's diets. That could be seen as unprofessional or even bullying.\n\nAlso, the author's justification is that they want to even the playing field or get back at the clique. However, undermining someone's health choices, even if they're dieting, isn't typically considered acceptable. There are better ways to handle workplace conflicts, like addressing the rudeness directly or seeking HR help.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the department. The author is providing snacks for everyone else, which is a positive aspect. But the negative aspect is targeting specific individuals. The question is whether the positive (happy department) outweighs the negative (harming dieters). Probably not, since the negative intent is specific and personal.\n\nIn terms of professional ethics, creating a hostile work environment or retaliating through subtle sabotage isn't advised. The author's actions might be fostering a toxic atmosphere. Even if the coworkers are unwelcoming, the author's method of response is not appropriate. They should address the issue through proper channels instead of personal retaliation.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's actions, while possibly understandable given the coworkers' behavior, are still unprofessional and wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
