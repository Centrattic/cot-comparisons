I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation is that the author has been getting rude treatment from a group of four women at work. They think the women are being cliquish and maybe jealous because the author is younger and makes more money. The author started bringing in snacks like cookies and pastries, knowing the women are on diets, and encourages them to indulge a little. The author claims it's working because they see the women taking the food, and others in the department appreciate the snacks.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for doing this. Let me break it down. First, the author's motivation: they're retaliating against the women for being rude and excluding them. The author feels targeted and maybe wants to get back at them. But the method is using food to undermine their diets. The author argues that they're also feeding others, so it's not just targeting the women. But the intention is specifically to \"wreck their diets.\"\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, even if the author has a reason, is it right to take actions that directly target others' personal goals? Dieting is a personal choice, and while the author might see it as harmless fun, it could be seen as manipulative. The author is using their knowledge of willpower to encourage the women to indulge, which might not be ethical. Also, the author is acting out of revenge for perceived slights. The coworkers being rude might not have justified the author's response. Even if the author is right about the women being mean, sabotaging their diets isn't a professional or respectful way to handle it.\n\nAdditionally, the author is using the department's shared space (the kitchen) to place these foods, which could affect others, even if they do get appreciation. But the main intent is to target specific people. The author might be creating a hostile work environment, even if indirectly. The act of undermining someone's health goals could be considered bullying or harassment, depending on the context. The author isn't just bringing food; they're actively trying to make the women fail at their diets, which is a personal attack.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel justified because they're being treated poorly. But that doesn't excuse retaliatory behavior. The workplace should be a professional setting where conflicts are resolved respectfully. The author's actions could lead to further tension and might not address the root cause of the problem. Instead of confronting the issue directly or seeking support through proper channels, the author is choosing a passive-aggressive approach.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have a reason to feel upset, their method of retaliation is unprofessional and unethical. It's not appropriate to use others' personal health goals against them, even in a workplace where there are conflicts. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
