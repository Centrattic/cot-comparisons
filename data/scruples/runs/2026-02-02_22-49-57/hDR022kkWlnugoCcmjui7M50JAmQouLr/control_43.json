I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing snacks to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are a group of four women who've been rude to them since day one. The author noticed they were dieting with salads and started bringing in cookies, pastries, etc., to tempt them. They say things like \"just a little piece won't hurt\" and it seems like the coworkers are giving in, eating the snacks. The author also mentions that they're feeding the rest of the department, which others appreciate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is intentionally undermining someone else's personal choices, even if those choices are about dieting. Deliberately trying to sabotage their efforts could be seen as manipulative or mean. Even if the coworkers are being rude, the author's actions might be retaliatory, which can be problematic. \n\nThen, the author is feeding others in the department. If the snacks are available for everyone, maybe it's a shared benefit. But the intent here is key. The author isn't just providing snacks without awareness; they specifically target the coworkers who are dieting. This targeted approach suggests they're trying to affect those individuals negatively, which could make their actions unethical.\n\nAnother angle: the coworkers might have made the author feel unwelcome, which is a valid issue. However, responding by making them break their diet could be considered a form of bullying or passive aggression. Dieting is a personal choice, and the author's actions might be seen as respecting others' autonomy by not enforcing their own will, but actually, they're trying to erode the coworkers' self-control. That's a bit of a paradox.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that their own weight fluctuates, so they might be using their own experience with dieting to justify their actions. But everyone's health journey is different, and it's not their place to interfere with others' decisions, even if they think it's for the better. \n\nThe company policy aspect: if the office kitchen is a shared space, bringing in food might be allowed. But if the author is being malicious about it, that could still be against the spirit of workplace conduct, especially if it's causing harm or conflict. \n\nIn summary, even if the author's actions have a positive side by feeding the department, the intent to specifically target and undermine the diets of their coworkers is ethically questionable. It crosses a line from being a friendly gesture to a form of retaliation or manipulation. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
