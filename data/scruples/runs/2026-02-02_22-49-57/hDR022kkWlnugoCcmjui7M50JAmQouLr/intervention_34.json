I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author works in an office where a group of four women have been rude to her since she started a year ago. They're part of a clique, and one is the assistant to her boss who leaves her off social function emails. The author suspects jealousy because she's younger and makes more money, but she's not sure. \n\nTo get back at them, she's been bringing in unhealthy foods like cookies, pastries, and cheese platters, encouraging the group to indulge by saying things like \"just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\" She's been doing this for three weeks and noticed the women taking more food. She also mentions that other coworkers are appreciative since she's feeding the department.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she isn't, but wants to know the perspective. \n\nFirst, I should consider if her actions are justified. She's retaliating against being excluded and rudely treated. However, intentionally sabotaging their diets by providing tempting foods might be seen as mean-spirited or cruel. Even if the coworkers are being unkind, does that give her the right to target their health goals? \n\nAlso, she's affecting not just the four women but the entire department's food choices. While others appreciate the snacks, the women in question are specifically trying to diet. By undermining their diet, she's contributing to their potential health setbacks. \n\nAnother angle is that she's using food as a weapon, which could be considered a form of bullying. Even if her motivation is personal, it's still unprofessional and might lead to a hostile work environment. \n\nOn the other hand, she's not directly harming them physically, just tempting them with food. The line between pranks and harm is blurry here. But since they were dieting, the author is exploiting their vulnerabilities, which is manipulative. \n\nIn terms of workplace ethics, even if she's being retaliatory, targeting specific individuals' health goals is crossing a line. It's unprofessional and could be considered harassment if it's meant to retaliate against professional mistreatment. \n\nSo, even though the coworkers were rude to her, her response is not appropriate. She's creating a hostile environment and could face consequences for it. Therefore, she is in the wrong.\n"
