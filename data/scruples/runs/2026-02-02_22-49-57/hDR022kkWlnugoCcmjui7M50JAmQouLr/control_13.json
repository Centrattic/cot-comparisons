I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that they're bringing in delicious food to the office specifically to disrupt their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are described as being rude, part of a clique, and excluding the author. The author mentions that these women are dieting together and have been eating salads. The author brings in treats like cookies, pastries, etc., and encourages them to indulge, knowing that even a small crack in dieting can lead to giving up. The author also mentions that other coworkers are happy with the snacks.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for doing this. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the author's intention here is to undermine the diets of these particular coworkers. Even if the coworkers are being rude, is it okay to take revenge by messing with their diets? The author is using others' food as a weapon, so to speak. \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that they're getting back at the coworkers who've been excluding them. The coworkers are part of a clique, left the author off emails, and are generally unpleasant. The author might feel justified in wanting to disrupt their diets as a form of retaliation. However, diets are personal choices, and even if the coworkers are being rude, targeting their health goals could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is also providing snacks for the rest of the department, which others appreciate. But the key here is that the author is specifically targeting these four women, not offering food to everyone equally. The act of encouraging them to eat despite their diets, knowing it's harmful to their goals, is a deliberate choice. \n\nEthically, is it right to sabotage someone else's personal goals, even if they're being mean? That's a tricky question. If the coworkers had asked the author to keep the snacks away, that might be one thing, but the author is choosing to target them. The author's actions could be seen as malicious, using others' weaknesses or willpower issues against them. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that the coworkers can \"stand to lose weight\" is problematic. Assuming someone's weight is an issue and making a decision for them about their health isn't fair. Even if the coworkers are dieting for health reasons, the author is undermining their autonomy. \n\nMoreover, the author's approach might not be effective in the long run. While it might seem like it's working now, encouraging unhealthy eating habits could have negative consequences. The author might think they're helping break the coworkers' willpower, but it's a form of manipulation. \n\nIn terms of workplace dynamics, bringing in food is generally a positive thing, but the author is using it as a tool for revenge. The other coworkers who are happy with the snacks aren't the target here, but the four women are being specifically targeted. That's a form of workplace harassment or bullying, even if it's subtle. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are a form of retaliation that's crossing into harmful territory. Even if the coworkers are rude, the author's method of response is inappropriate. It's not about whether the coworkers deserve it, but about the author's right to interfere with someone else's health choices. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
