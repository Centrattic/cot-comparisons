I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves someone bringing in delicious food to the office specifically to undermine their coworkers' diets, who are being rude to them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is being treated rudely by a group of four women at work. They've been exclusionary, like leaving the author off emails. The author wants to get back at them by bringing in tempting food, knowing that even a small indulgence can break a diet. The coworkers are eating the food, and the author is also feeding others in the department. The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). The user is leaning towards B, but I need to evaluate it objectively.\n\nLet me break it down. Are there any ethical issues here? The author is retaliating against workplace bullying. The coworkers are being rude and exclusionary, which is unprofessional. The author's response is to sabotage their diets by providing tempting food. Even though the author claims it's working (the coworkers are eating the food), is that a justified response?\n\nWorkplace bullying is a serious issue, and retaliation can also be problematic. The author might feel justified because they're being treated poorly, but using another form of unkindness as retaliation doesn't resolve the issue and might escalate tensions. Additionally, the author is affecting others (feeding 20 people) which is positive, but the intent is specifically to target the dieting coworkers. \n\nIs there a difference between the wrongdoings? If the coworkers are being unkind and exclusionary, that's a form of bullying. The author's action is a form of sabotage, which is also unkind. Both sides have issues here. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's action is a form of retaliation for being mistreated. But even if someone else is at fault, does that give you the right to retaliate? In a professional setting, retaliation is generally discouraged. It's better to address the issue through proper channels rather than personal revenge.\n\nMoreover, the author is using their position to influence others' health choices. Even if the coworkers are on diets, the author isn't their boss or health advisor. Encouraging others to break their diets, even playfully, could be seen as manipulative. The author knows about the diets and is exploiting that for personal satisfaction. That's a form of manipulation and could be considered unprofessional.\n\nAnother angle: the author is feeding the entire department, which is a positive action. This might balance out the negative intent towards the specific coworkers. But the intent is targeted. The act of bringing food is good, but the motivation to undermine specific coworkers is bad. So the action is a mix of good and bad. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the coworker's behavior is unprofessional, but the author's retaliation is also unprofessional, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because retaliation is not the appropriate response, even if the other party is at fault. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the author is justified in standing up for themselves. But in a professional setting, personal vendettas aren't typically acceptable. The author should address the mistreatment through HR or other proper channels instead of taking matters into their own hands. Therefore, the author's actions are unprofessional and retaliatory, making them the asshole.\n"
