I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple moving in together, where the author is sensitive to their boyfriend's laptop sounds and brightness, especially ASMR with whispering, which causes them anxiety. They ask him to adjust his habits, and he responds by using earphones. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has legitimate health concerns related to misophonia, which is a real condition. They provided a study, which shows they're trying to communicate their needs respectfully. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's making an effort to accommodate them. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine he's used to. Moving in together means both have to adjust. The question is whether the author's requests are reasonable. Since they're trying to get sleep and have a valid medical issue, their needs are important. The boyfriend's response seems to show he's willing to adapt, which is positive. \n\nThe key points are: the author is not being confrontational, they're asking for adjustments for their well-being, and the boyfriend is accommodating. There's communication and mutual effort. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
