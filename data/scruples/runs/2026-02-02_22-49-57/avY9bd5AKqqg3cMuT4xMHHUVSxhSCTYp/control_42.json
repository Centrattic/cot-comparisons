I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime routine. The main issue is that the author needs silence and darkness to sleep, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR or YouTube, which the author finds uncomfortable, especially the whispering ASMR. They mention misophonia, which is a real condition where certain sounds cause distress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's requests are reasonable. They moved in together, so setting boundaries is normal. The boyfriend's habits are affecting the author's sleep, which is important for health. The author is asking for things like lower volume, dimmed screen, etc. Those are common requests in shared living spaces. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend might feel his needs are also valid. He uses ASMR as a way to wind down, which could be part of his mental health routine. The key here is communication. The author did explain their feelings and showed a study, which shows they tried to be understanding. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he might be avoiding the issue rather than finding a mutual solution.\n\nMisophonia is a real condition, so the author isn't being unreasonable. They're trying to create a sleep environment that works for them. The boyfriend should be accommodating if possible. The author's requests are about their health and well-being, which should take precedence. Unless the boyfriend is unwilling to compromise, but the scenario doesn't show that he's refusing entirely\u2014just that he's using earphones. Maybe the author needs to talk to him again about finding a compromise that works for both. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Their needs are valid, especially with a medical condition involved. The boyfriend should make adjustments to respect their partner's needs. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
