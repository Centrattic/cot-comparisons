I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple who moved in together. The author is asking their boyfriend to lower the laptop's sound and brightness because they need silence and darkness to sleep. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves watching YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds disturbing, especially whispering ASMR, which the author has misophonia for.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is communicating their needs, which are valid for their well-being. The boyfriend's habits are a personal preference, but they're affecting the author's sleep and mental health. The author has tried to explain their sensitivity, even showing a study. The boyfriend's reaction is to put in earphones, but maybe that's not enough. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? Well, they're in their own home and have a right to a good sleep environment. The boyfriend's enjoyment shouldn't override the author's health. However, the author is repeatedly asking, which might be seen as nagging. But given the health aspect, it's more about necessary adjustments. \n\nThe boyfriend's response of rolling away and using earphones might not address the brightness issue. The author is asking for mutual respect. Since the author has a medical condition (misophonia), their request is justified. So, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
