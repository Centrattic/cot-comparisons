I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness to accommodate their sleep needs. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple just moved in together. The man watches YouTube, listens to ASMR, or uses his laptop before bed, which affects the woman's sleep. She needs silence and darkness. She asks him to lower the volume and brightness, etc., and he doesn't seem happy.\n\nThen there's the ASMR part. She has misophonia triggered by whispering ASMR, which causes her anxiety and discomfort. She showed him a study about it, and he used earphones. Now she's wondering if she's being an asshole for setting these boundaries.\n\nI should consider both sides. The woman has legitimate needs for a good night's sleep. Moving in together means adjusting to each other's habits. It's reasonable to ask for things that affect shared living spaces. Misophonia is a real condition, so her reaction to whispering isn't just being picky\u2014it's a medical issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the man has his own bedtime routine. But moving in together also requires compromise. She's asking him to use earphones or adjust the brightness, which are manageable. He could be more accommodating, but she's not unreasonable for setting these boundaries. \n\nThe key points are mutual adjustment and communication. She communicated her needs, provided evidence for her misophonia, and he did respond by using earphones. That shows he's willing to adjust. But maybe the frequency of asking him to adjust could be an issue. However, given her health and well-being, it's justified. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's advocating for her needs in a shared space, especially with a medical condition involved. Both need to compromise, but she's not the asshole here.\n"
