I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is the asshole for asking their boyfriend to turn down his laptop and avoid certain ASMR sounds when they're trying to sleep. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using his laptop, which the author finds disruptive. The author has misophonia, specifically triggered by whispering ASMR, which causes anxiety and discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid health issue, misophonia, which is causing them real distress. They\u2019re trying to communicate their needs, which is reasonable in a relationship. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has his own preferences and habits. However, moving in together means compromising on living arrangements. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable in their requests.\n\nThe author isn't just asking him to stop entirely but to adjust the volume and brightness. They also provided the boyfriend with research about their condition, which shows they're trying to explain the issue. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014putting in earphones\u2014suggests he's trying to accommodate, which is good. But the author is still having to ask repeatedly, which might indicate that the boyfriend isn't fully respecting their needs. \n\nHowever, the author is within their rights to ask for accommodations in their own home, especially when it affects their well-being. Misophonia is a recognized condition, so the author isn't being irrational. The boyfriend should make an effort to comply with these reasonable requests. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe they could agree on specific times or areas where the boyfriend can use his laptop without disturbing the author. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're asking for something necessary for their health and the boyfriend isn't complying despite being informed, the author isn't the asshole here. The boyfriend's guilt pleasure shouldn't override the author's need for a peaceful sleep environment.\n"
