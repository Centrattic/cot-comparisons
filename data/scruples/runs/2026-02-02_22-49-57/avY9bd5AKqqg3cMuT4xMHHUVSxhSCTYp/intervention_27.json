I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend and his partner moving in together, with differing bedtime routines. The author is asking if it's wrong to constantly ask her boyfriend to lower his laptop's volume and brightness because his ASMR and other nighttime activities are causing her discomfort, including anxiety and irritability due to misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds trigger negative emotions and stress. The author has communicated her needs, provided research, and the boyfriend initially reacted by using earphones but then rolled away. The question is whether her actions are justified.\n\nIn relationships, especially when living together, mutual respect and accommodation are crucial. The author is setting boundaries because her health and well-being are affected. The boyfriend's habits are his preference, but when they impact another person's mental health, adjustments are necessary. She's not just asking for silence but specific accommodations like lowering brightness and volume, which can be seen as reasonable, especially in a shared living space.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel his needs are also important. However, given that the author's condition is affecting her, it's reasonable for her to request changes. The fact that she's tried to explain her situation and provided evidence (the study) shows she's not just being difficult but has a legitimate health concern. The boyfriend's response of using earphones seems a compromise, but the author might need more consistency.\n\nThe key here is whether her requests are reasonable. Since she's made her case and the boyfriend has some accommodations (like using earphones), her continued requests don't seem excessive. Living together requires compromise, and her health issues are valid. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
