I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple moving in together, and the author is asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness because it's affecting their sleep. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds uncomfortable, especially the whispering parts, which they link to misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what misophonia is. From what I know, misophonia is a condition where certain sounds trigger strong emotional or physiological reactions, like anxiety or irritation. So if the author actually has misophonia and certain sounds are causing them distress, that's a legitimate issue. The author mentions they found a study about it in relation to ASMR and showed it to their boyfriend. That seems like they're trying to communicate their feelings and the science behind it, which is reasonable.\n\nBut then, the boyfriend's reaction is to roll away and put in earphones. That's a good sign he's trying to accommodate. However, the author is repeatedly asking for adjustments. Now, moving in together means both people have to make compromises. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable.\n\nThe boyfriend is using his laptop, which is his personal device. The author is asking for him to lower the volume and brightness, which are reasonable requests if they're disturbing the author's sleep. It's a shared living space, so both need to adjust. The boyfriend's preference for ASMR is his own, but if it's causing the author distress, especially with the whispering, which the author has a legitimate sensitivity to, then it's a matter of mutual consideration.\n\nBut is the author overstepping? Well, they are setting boundaries for their own comfort, which is their right. The problem might be if the boyfriend isn't being cooperative, but the user says he does put earphones in after the study was shown. So he's making an effort. However, the author is asking to adjust the brightness as well. Laptop brightness can affect others in the room, so turning it down is a common courtesy. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here.\n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend is using earphones for ASMR, then the sound issue is resolved. The brightness might still be a problem. Maybe the author is asking for more than just earphones? The answer depends on whether the brightness is a significant issue and if the boyfriend is refusing to adjust it despite the author's requests.\n\nBut given that the author is sharing a space, it's reasonable to expect some adjustments. The key points are that the author has a legitimate sensitivity, they're communicating their needs, and the boyfriend is making some efforts. However, if the author is nagging or not allowing the boyfriend his own space, that could be an issue. The question is whether the author is being too demanding or if their needs are valid.\n\nConsidering all that, the author is not the asshole because they're managing their health condition and trying to communicate their needs. The boyfriend should be accommodating as much as possible. So the answer would be B.\n"
