I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves their boyfriend's bedtime habits conflicting with the author's need for silence and darkness. The key points are the boyfriend's use of laptop sound and brightness, and the author's discomfort with ASMR, especially whispering, which they associate with misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of shared living spaces. When two people live together, especially in close quarters like a bedroom, it's reasonable to expect some negotiation of space and habits. The author mentions they moved in together and knew about each other's routines. That suggests some prior discussion, but maybe not enough to address the specific issues that arose.\n\nThe boyfriend's use of a laptop at night could indeed disturb the author's sleep. Bright screens and sounds can interfere with sleep quality. The author is asking for adjustments, which seems reasonable. It's a common issue in couples where one person's habits affect the other's rest.\n\nThe ASMR part is more nuanced. The author has a specific sensitivity to whispering, which they've linked to misophonia. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds trigger strong negative reactions. The author did research and shared it with the boyfriend, who then used earphones. That shows the boyfriend made an effort once the issue was explained. However, if the boyfriend continues to use whispering ASMR despite being told it's a problem, that's on him. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for asking him to adjust.\n\nThe author is communicating their needs and boundaries, which is healthy. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling over, putting in earphones) indicates he's trying to comply. If the author is consistently having to ask, maybe there's a need for a more permanent solution, like using a white noise machine or agreeing on a quiet time before bed. But the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their discomfort. It's a matter of mutual respect and accommodation.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the boyfriend should have considered the author's needs before moving in together. Or that the author should be more flexible since they knew about his habits. But the author isn't unreasonable\u2014they're asking for adjustments that are feasible (turning down sound, brightness, using earphones). The boyfriend's guilt about ASMR suggests he might be prioritizing his own comfort over the author's, which isn't fair. The study the author shared shows they're trying to be understanding and provide evidence, which is proactive.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. They're advocating for their well-being in a shared space, and the boyfriend should be accommodating his partner's needs as much as possible. The answer should be B (No).\n"
