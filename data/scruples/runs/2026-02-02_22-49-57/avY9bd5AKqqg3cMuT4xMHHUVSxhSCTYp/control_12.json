I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits because the laptop's sound and brightness bother them. The boyfriend listens to ASMR, especially whispering, which the author has misophonia towards. The author has explained their feelings and shown a study, but the boyfriend reacts by putting in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid health issue\u2014misophonia can be a real problem causing anxiety and discomfort. They're trying to communicate their needs, which is important in a relationship. The boyfriend's habits are affecting their well-being. However, the boyfriend might also have his own needs for relaxation through ASMR. \n\nBut since they live together, communication and compromise are key. The author isn't just being petty; they're addressing a legitimate issue. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he's trying to comply, but maybe not in the best way. The author's requests are reasonable because they need a quiet, dark room to sleep. It's a shared space, so both parties should adjust. The fact that the author tried to explain their condition and showed a study shows they're trying to be understanding. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure being ASMR doesn't give him the right to ignore his partner's discomfort. \n\nMisophonia is a recognized condition, so the author isn't being unreasonable. They're advocating for their health. The boyfriend should find alternative ways to enjoy ASMR without affecting his partner. The author isn't in the wrong here; they're setting necessary boundaries. The answer should be B, not A.\n"
