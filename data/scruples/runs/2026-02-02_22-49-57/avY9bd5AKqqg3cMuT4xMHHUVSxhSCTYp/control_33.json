I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep. The boyfriend listens to ASMR, especially whispering, which the author has misophonia and finds really annoying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They just moved in together. The author made their preferences clear from the start. They're asking for a quiet and dark environment for sleep, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's habits are causing discomfort, so the author is trying to communicate boundaries. That's normal in a relationship. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, rolling away and putting in earphones, shows he's trying to accommodate. The author isn't forbidding him from doing ASMR entirely, just adjusting it when they're together. They even provided a study to explain their condition. That seems like they're being considerate. \n\nMisophonia is a real condition, so the author's sensitivity isn't just being fussy. The boyfriend's actions are affecting the author's sleep and well-being. In relationships, both partners often have to compromise. It's about finding a mutual solution. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're advocating for their needs. \n\nThe boyfriend might be frustrated, but the author isn't in the wrong for trying to maintain their health and sleep. So the answer should be B, the author isn't the asshole.\n"
