I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. They moved in together, and the author is asking the boyfriend to lower the laptop's sound and brightness because they need silence and darkness to sleep. The boyfriend uses ASMR, which the author has misophonia towards, especially whispering ASMR. The author shared a study about it, and the boyfriend put earphones in. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds cause distress. The author has a legitimate sensitivity. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves activities (watching YouTube, ASMR) that interfere with the author's sleep. Communication is key in relationships, so the author is addressing their needs. However, the boyfriend's reaction (rolling away, using earphones) might indicate he's trying to accommodate. The author's persistence in asking for adjustments is reasonable since they need a good night's sleep. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel his needs are being ignored. But given the health aspect of misophonia, the author is justified in setting boundaries. The answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
