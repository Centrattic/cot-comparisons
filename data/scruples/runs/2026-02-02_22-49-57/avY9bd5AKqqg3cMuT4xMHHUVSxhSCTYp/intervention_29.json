  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use at night. The boyfriend's routine includes YouTube, ASMR, and using the laptop, which the author finds disruptive. The key points here are the author's need for silence and darkness for sleep, and the boyfriend's use of ASMR, which the author has misophonia towards, especially whispering.\n\nFirst, the author is moving in together, so they're in a shared living space. It's reasonable to expect some compromise. The boyfriend's habits are affecting the author's sleep, which is a valid concern. Sleep is important for health, so the author has a legitimate reason to ask for adjustments. The boyfriend might not realize how much the ASMR, particularly the whispering, affects the author, even if he's not being loud. The author did try to communicate this by showing a study, which shows they're making an effort to explain their sensitivity.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and putting in earphones might indicate he's trying to comply, but maybe there's a lack of mutual understanding. The author is asking for specific, reasonable adjustments that don't infringe on the boyfriend's habits entirely. They're not banning him from using the laptop but just asking to lower the volume and brightness. The author's feelings of anxiety and discomfort are real and valid, especially with misophonia, which is a recognized condition.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's enjoyment of ASMR is his personal preference. The question is about balance. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries in their own space, especially since they're sharing a room. The boyfriend should also consider his partner's needs. The main issue is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since they're moving in together, both should have made these adjustments beforehand. The author is trying to communicate their needs, so it's more about compromise. The boyfriend might need to find alternatives or use headphones to respect the author's needs. The author isn't in the wrong for advocating for their health and comfort.\n"
