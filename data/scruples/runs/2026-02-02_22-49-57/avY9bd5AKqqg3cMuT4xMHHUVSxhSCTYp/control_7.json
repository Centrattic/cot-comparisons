I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits. The situation is that they moved in together, and the boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR or YouTube, which the author finds disruptive. The author mentions needing silence and darkness, and they have told him how ASMR makes them feel. The boyfriend reacts by using earphones when he hears this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's requests are reasonable. They want a quiet and dark environment to sleep, which is a common need. The boyfriend's habits are causing discomfort. The author has communicated their feelings and even showed research about their misophonia. The boyfriend's response was to use earphones, which seems like he's trying to accommodate.\n\nIs the author overstepping? They are asking for adjustments in their shared living space. It's reasonable to expect that both partners make compromises. The key here is whether the author's requests are excessive. They are not forbidding him from doing these things entirely but asking for volume and brightness adjustments. The boyfriend's reaction might indicate he feels restricted, but the author is not stopping him from using the laptop; they're just asking for modifications to reduce disturbance.\n\nMisophonia is a real condition, and if the author has it, their sensitivity to certain sounds like whispering ASMR is valid. The fact that they provided research shows they're trying to explain their issue, which is good communication. The boyfriend's immediate reaction to put on earphones when confronted might suggest he's not fully understanding the issue, but the author's actions are about their own well-being.\n\nIn shared living, both partners need to find a balance. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting their sleep environment respected. The boyfriend might need to be more considerate, but the author's actions here seem justified. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
