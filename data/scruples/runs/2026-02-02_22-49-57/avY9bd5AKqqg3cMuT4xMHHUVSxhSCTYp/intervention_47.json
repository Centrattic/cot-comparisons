I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop sounds and brightness when they're trying to sleep, especially due to discomfort with ASMR and whispering. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author lives with their boyfriend and has a bedtime routine that requires silence and darkness. The boyfriend uses his laptop for YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds distressing because of misophonia, a condition where certain sounds cause discomfort. The author has communicated their needs, shown research, and the boyfriend has responded by putting on earphones. \n\nNow, the key points here are communication and accommodation. The author isn't asking for anything unreasonable\u2014they want the boyfriend to use earphones, lower the volume, or reduce brightness. These are common household accommodations when roommates or partners have differing needs. The boyfriend's reaction (putting on earphones) suggests he's trying to comply, so the author isn't being overly demanding. \n\nMisophonia is a legitimate condition, and the author's sensitivity to certain sounds is a valid medical issue. The boyfriend's ASMR habit is a personal preference, but when it affects someone else's well-being, adjustments are necessary. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author is being too strict or not considering the boyfriend's preferences enough. But since they've communicated their needs and the boyfriend is making adjustments, it's a mutual effort. The author's actions are about their health and comfort, which takes priority.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're advocating for their needs in a respectful and justified way.\n"
