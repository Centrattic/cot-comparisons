I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they moved in together, and their boyfriend uses his laptop for bedtime, which is causing issues for the author.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they need silence and darkness for their bedtime routine. That's a reasonable need, right? People have different routines, and it's common for partners to adjust to each other. But the boyfriend is using the laptop, maybe with ASMR that has whispering. The author has to ask him to turn down the sound and brightness, which he doesn't seem to like. \n\nThe key point here is the ASMR with whispering. The author has misophonia, which is a real condition where certain sounds trigger strong negative reactions. They showed a study to the boyfriend, who then put in earphones. So he tried to accommodate once he understood the issue. But the author is still asking him to adjust his routine, which might involve other things like rolling over or using covers. \n\nNow, the question is whether it's fair for the author to keep asking for these adjustments. Since they've moved in together, sharing a living space means making compromises. The boyfriend's use of earphones is a good step, but maybe the author is still bothered by the brightness of the laptop or his movements. \n\nBut the problem is, is the author being too controlling? They did let him watch his stuff, which is good, but the repeated requests could be seen as nagging. However, given that he has a medical condition (misophonia) that makes the whispering ASMR particularly distressing, his concerns are valid. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he tried to comply after being informed. \n\nSo, the author has a legitimate reason to ask for a quieter and darker environment. The boyfriend should be accommodating, especially if he's aware of the issue. The fact that the author provided a study shows they're trying to explain their condition, which is reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend is being asked multiple times every night and it's becoming a source of irritation for him, maybe the author could find another solution, like using a white noise machine or separate sleeping arrangements. But the core issue here is the ASMR content that the author finds unbearable. The boyfriend's adjustment (earphones) was immediate once he knew, but maybe the author needs to communicate more effectively or find a balance where both can meet in the middle without constant requests. \n\nIn terms of wrongdoings, the author isn't being unreasonable. They have a medical sensitivity and are trying to maintain their own well-being. The boyfriend's pleasure shouldn't come at the expense of the author's health. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's anything else. The author is \"pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me,\" which is understandable if it's affecting their sleep and mental state. The boyfriend's response was to use earphones, which is good, but maybe he could also explore other types of ASMR that don't involve whispering. \n\nI think the author's actions are justified. They're trying to coexist in the shared space with their needs, and the boyfriend's adjustment was a valid response. The author isn't the asshole here. So the answer is B.\n"
