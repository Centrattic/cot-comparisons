I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the scenario) is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use when she's trying to sleep. She mentions she has misophonia, specifically triggered by whispering ASMR, which makes her anxious. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They just moved in together, so establishing boundaries is part of the process. The author is explaining her needs and how the boyfriend's habits affect her. She's not just being picky; there's a documented condition involved (misophonia) that's causing real discomfort. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he respects her request.\n\nIs there a balance here? The boyfriend might have his own needs (using the laptop for relaxation), but so does the author (sleeping in silence and darkness). The key is whether the author is unreasonable. Since she's accommodating his routine as much as possible while also asserting her own needs based on a medical condition, it seems justified. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, but he's making adjustments when asked. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe she's being too demanding, but given the health aspect, it's reasonable. Also, mutual adjustments are normal in relationships. The fact that she's provided information about misophonia and he responded positively shows he's willing to compromise. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong. She's communicating her needs and managing a health issue, which the boyfriend is respecting. The boyfriend's guilt about ASMR isn't relevant here; what matters is their ability to find a middle ground. Since she's not being unreasonable and there's a valid medical reason, the author is justified.\n"
