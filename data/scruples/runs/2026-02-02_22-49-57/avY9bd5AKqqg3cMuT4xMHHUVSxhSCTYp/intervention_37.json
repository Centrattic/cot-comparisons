I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness because it's affecting their sleep. The user has misophonia, especially triggered by whispering ASMR, which causes anxiety and discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly explaining their needs because of their health condition. They mentioned showing a study to their boyfriend, which suggests they're trying to communicate their issue in a factual way. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones indicates he's trying to comply, at least after being shown the study.\n\nBut let's think about the dynamics. Moving in together can create new challenges where both partners need to adjust. The boyfriend's bedtime routine is part of his self-care or relaxation, and the author is asking for changes. However, the author has a medical condition (misophonia) that's causing real distress. It's not just about being sensitive; it's a recognized condition that affects their well-being.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual adjustment. The author is setting boundaries to protect their health, which is reasonable. They're also making an effort to explain their condition, showing they're not just being difficult. The boyfriend's willingness to use earphones is a positive step, but maybe he needs to be more proactive in adjusting his habits without being asked repeatedly. However, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their needs.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could be more considerate of their boyfriend's preferences, but given the health aspect, it's a balance. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for the way they're asking. They're not being aggressive but are communicating their discomfort. So, considering all factors, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
