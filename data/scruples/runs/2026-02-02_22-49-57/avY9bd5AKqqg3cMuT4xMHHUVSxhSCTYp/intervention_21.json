I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend and his bedtime habits causing discomfort.\n\nFirst, the author wants a quiet and dark room to sleep, which is normal. The boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR, which the author finds stressful. The author has misophonia related to whispering, so they've explained this and shown a study. The boyfriend responds by putting in earphones.\n\nThe key points here: the author is advocating for their own discomfort, which is legitimate. They've communicated their needs clearly, even providing evidence for their sensitivity. The boyfriend is accommodating by using earphones. The author isn't outright banning the ASMR but is asking for adjustments. \n\nIs it reasonable to expect your partner to adjust their habits to accommodate your sleep needs? In a shared living space, mutual adjustments are part of a healthy relationship. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're setting boundaries for their well-being. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's trying to comply. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their needs in a respectful way, and the boyfriend is making an effort. The answer should be B.\n"
