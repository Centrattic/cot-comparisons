I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author's boyfriend using his laptop with sound and brightness at night, which disturbs her sleep. She has misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR, and she's asking him to adjust his habits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly explaining her needs: she needs silence and darkness to sleep. She's communicating her discomfort about the laptop's sound and brightness. She mentions that she has a medical condition (misophonia) that makes certain sounds, like whispering ASMR, really stressful. She even showed him a study to explain her reaction. He responds by putting in earphones, which suggests he's trying to accommodate her.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine that he's used to. Moving in together means both need to adjust. But the author is setting boundaries that are necessary for her well-being. Since she's explaining her medical issue and the study, it's reasonable that she's asking for adjustments. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones shows he's trying to comply.\n\nIs she being too demanding? Maybe not. She's not banning him from using his laptop entirely but is asking for adjustments that don't inconvenience him too much. The key points are communication and mutual adjustment. Since she's clearly expressing her needs and he's making efforts to comply, it seems like she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, but if he's willing to use earphones, that's a simple solution. The author's health and sleep are important, so she's justified in setting these boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
