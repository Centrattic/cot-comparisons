I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who uses his laptop (watching YouTube, listening to ASMR) at night, and the author is asking him to lower the volume and brightness because it's disturbing her sleep. The key points here are misophonia and the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that she has misophonia, specifically triggered by whispering or vocal ASMR. That's a legitimate medical condition where certain sounds cause strong negative reactions. She's sharing her feelings and showing him a study, which seems reasonable because she's trying to explain why it's bothering her.\n\nShe's asking him to adjust his behavior, which is common in relationships when shared living spaces are involved. The boyfriend's reaction is to roll away and put in earphones, which suggests he's complying but maybe not happy about it. The question is whether her asking for these adjustments makes her the asshole.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate needs, especially when health conditions are involved. Since she's moving in together, setting boundaries early is wise. Her actions are about her well-being and health, not just personal preference. The boyfriend might be upset because his habits are being disrupted, but the author isn't forcing him to stop entirely\u2014just to adjust when she's sleeping. \n\nThe key here is that she's giving him options (turn it down, use earphones, etc.) and explaining her condition. It's about mutual respect and adjustment. The boyfriend could also use headphones if he's listening to ASMR, which would solve the problem without her needing to ask him every time. However, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting her needs, especially when it's health-related. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No), she's not in the wrong. She's advocating for her health, communicating her needs, and making reasonable requests. The boyfriend's reaction is his own response, but that doesn't make her wrong for standing up for herself.\n"
