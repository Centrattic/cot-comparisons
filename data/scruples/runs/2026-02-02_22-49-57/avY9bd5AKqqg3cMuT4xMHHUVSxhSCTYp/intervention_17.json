I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR consumption when the author is trying to sleep. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they have misophonia, specifically triggered by whispering ASMR. They provided a study to the boyfriend, and he responded by putting in earphones. That seems like a valid reason for the request. \n\nThe boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using his laptop with sound and brightness, which affects the author's need for silence and darkness. They've tried to compromise by asking him to adjust. The author isn't outright banning his habits but is asking for modifications to coexist. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones shows he respects her feelings. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're addressing their specific needs. Since they just moved in together, setting boundaries is normal. The key here is that the author isn't asking for much, just adjustments to their existing habits, and the boyfriend is accommodating. \n\nNo signs of the author being demanding or inconsiderate. Their needs are legitimate, and they're communicating them. So, the answer should be B.\n"
