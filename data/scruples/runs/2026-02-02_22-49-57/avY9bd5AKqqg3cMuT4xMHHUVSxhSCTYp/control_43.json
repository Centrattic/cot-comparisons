I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) question is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend using his laptop with sound and brightness in their shared room, which the author finds disturbing, especially the whispering ASMR. They mention they have misophonia and showed a study to their boyfriend, who then used earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is being unreasonable. The key points are mutual respect in a shared living space and the boyfriend's response. The author is asking for adjustments to accommodate their need for silence and darkness, which are valid if they have a medical condition like misophonia. The boyfriend, after being shown the study, complied by using earphones. That suggests he respected her concerns once he understood the impact. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for setting boundaries. Since they moved in together, it's normal to establish living habits. The author's requests are about the environment during their bedtime, which is a personal need. The boyfriend's initial reaction (rolling away and using earphones) shows he took the advice seriously. The author isn't forbidding him from doing anything but asking for adjustments that don't intrude on her space. \n\nMisophonia is a real condition, so the author's discomfort isn't just personal preference. The boyfriend's willingness to use earphones implies he's trying to meet her needs. The author's actions are about communication and compromise, which are essential in a relationship. Therefore, the author is not the asshole here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
