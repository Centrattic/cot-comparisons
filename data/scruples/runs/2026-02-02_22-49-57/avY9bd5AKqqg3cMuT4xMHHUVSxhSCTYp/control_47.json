I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening when she's trying to sleep. The situation involves moving in together, which can lead to conflicts in routines. \n\nFirst, the author mentions she needs silence and darkness for sleep, while he uses his laptop with ASMR, which she has misophonia towards whispers. She's asked him to lower volume and brightness multiple times. He does listen sometimes, like when she showed him the study about misophonia and ASMR, and he used earphones.\n\nNow, considering the key points: She's communicating her needs, which is reasonable. Misophonia is a real condition, and she's explaining it to him. He's making an effort by using earphones when he knows it affects her. The question is whether her requests are unreasonable. Since she's made an effort to explain her condition and he's responsive when he can, it seems fair. On the other hand, if he's consistently annoyed by her requests, but the problem is that his habits are directly affecting her well-being. \n\nIn relationships, communication and compromise are important. She's not asking him to stop entirely but to adjust when she's sleeping. He could also adjust by using earphones or moving to another room, which he does sometimes. Since she's making an effort to explain and he's sometimes compliant, but there's ongoing conflict, maybe there's room for compromise. However, given that misophonia can have real effects, her requests aren't unreasonable. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
