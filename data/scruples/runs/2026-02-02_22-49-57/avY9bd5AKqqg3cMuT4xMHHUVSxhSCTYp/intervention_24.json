I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they moved in together with their boyfriend. The boyfriend has a bedtime routine involving a laptop, which includes ASMR, especially whispering. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep and is bothered by the laptop's sound and brightness. They ask him to adjust it, which upsets him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for a quiet and dark environment to sleep. Misophonia, or in this case, a sensitivity to certain sounds like whispering ASMR, is real. They mentioned a study and showed it to him, which he then took action on by using earphones. That shows he's trying to accommodate once he's aware.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own preferences for his bedtime routine. Moving in together means both have to make compromises. The author isn't outright banning his routine, just asking him to adjust it when it's affecting her sleep. It's reasonable to expect some consideration for each other's needs in a shared living space.\n\nThe key points here are mutual adjustment and communication. The author communicates their needs and he responds by using earphones when she points out the issue. There's no indication that the author is being unreasonable beyond what's necessary for her well-being. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away) might be a defensive one, but the author isn't in the wrong if they're clearly expressing their needs for health reasons.\n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to maintain their sleep environment, which is important for their health. The boyfriend could also adjust by using earphones more consistently instead of waiting for the author to ask each time. But the author's actions are justified.\n"
