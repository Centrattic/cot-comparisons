I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to turn down his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep, and for expressing their discomfort with ASMR, especially whispering. \n\nFirst, the situation is that they just moved in together. The boyfriend has a bedtime routine involving YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds disruptive. The author needs silence and darkness. They've tried asking him to adjust, which he does, but he clearly isn't happy about it. The author has a specific issue with whispering ASMR due to what sounds like misophonia, a condition where certain sounds are irritating. They showed him a study, and he responded by using earphones.\n\nSo, the key points are: they communicate their needs, he complies but it's not ideal for him, and there's a health-related reason for the author's sensitivity. The question is whether the author is wrong for setting these boundaries.\n\nI think in a healthy relationship, both partners should accommodate each other's needs when possible. The author is trying to maintain their well-being by addressing a valid health issue. It's reasonable to expect some compromise. The boyfriend adjusting his setup to accommodate the author's needs isn't unreasonable, especially since they live together. The author isn't being overly demanding; they're expressing their needs with evidence. The boyfriend's reaction (putting in earphones) suggests he's making an effort, but maybe there's room for more discussion. However, the author isn't at fault for standing by their boundaries. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
