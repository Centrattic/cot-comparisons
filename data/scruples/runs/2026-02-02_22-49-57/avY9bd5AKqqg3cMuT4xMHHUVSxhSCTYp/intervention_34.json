  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a boyfriend and girlfriend living together. The author (a girl, I think) is really bothered by the boyfriend's laptop use at night. She needs silence and darkness to sleep, while he likes ASMR or watching videos with sound. She asks him to turn down the volume and brightness, and gets upset about his ASMR, especially the whispering parts. She mentioned she has misophonia related to whispers and showed him a study.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend has his own bedtime routine, which he's used to. Moving in together can create these kinds of conflicts. The author is making her needs known, which is reasonable. But is she being too demanding?\n\nShe's asking him to adjust his behavior, which is fair if his actions are affecting her. Misophonia is a real condition, and the whispering ASMR could genuinely trigger her. She's not just being sensitive here; there's a medical reason. She's tried to communicate this and even provided evidence, which shows she's trying to be understanding and reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel his needs are also important. He might be frustrated if he's constantly being asked to adjust. But living together means compromising. The author isn't asking him to give up his habits entirely, just to modify them when she's trying to sleep. That seems like a reasonable compromise.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe they could use earphones or find a time when he can do his ASMR when she's not in the room. But the fact that she's communicating her needs and making adjustments is important for a healthy relationship. The key here is mutual respect and finding solutions that work for both. Since she's not being unreasonable and is trying to explain her medical condition, it's more about adapting rather than being inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's advocating for her health and well-being, which is valid. The boyfriend should be accommodating if possible, and the author is trying to work through it by discussing and providing information. There's no indication she's being overly controlling without reason.\n"
