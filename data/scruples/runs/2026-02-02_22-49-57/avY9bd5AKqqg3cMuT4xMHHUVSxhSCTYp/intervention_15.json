I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep. The author also mentions their discomfort with ASMR, especially whispering, which they associate with misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The couple just moved in together, so they're adjusting to each other's habits. The author has specific needs for a quiet and dark environment to sleep, while the boyfriend has a different routine involving laptops and ASMR. The author is communicating their needs, which is important in any relationship. They provided context about their sensitivity to certain sounds, which seems valid based on the mention of misophonia and a study they shared. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he respects her feelings once informed.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. If they're consistently asking for adjustments that are necessary for their well-being, that's reasonable. However, if they're being overly demanding or not considering the boyfriend's needs, it could be a problem. But from the description, the author is accommodating by allowing him to watch or listen but within limits to not disturb her. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure being ASMR adds a layer where he might have a strong preference, but the author's health and comfort (due to misophonia) are also important.\n\nIn relationships, communication and compromise are key. The author is communicating their needs, especially regarding their health (misophonia), which is a legitimate concern. The boyfriend's adjustment (using earphones) shows he's making an effort. Unless the author is being unreasonable or not flexible, they aren't the problem here. The fact that they provided a study to explain their condition shows they're trying to be understanding. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because they're advocating for their health and well-being in a shared living space.\n"
