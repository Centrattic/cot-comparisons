I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep, especially because the boyfriend's ASMR watching is causing the author anxiety due to misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and their boyfriend have moved in together, which means they share a living space. The author has a bedtime routine that requires silence and darkness, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR, which the author finds uncomfortable. The author has communicated their discomfort, shown a study about misophonia, and the boyfriend has taken steps to mitigate it by using earphones.\n\nMisophonia is a recognized condition where certain sounds trigger strong negative reactions. In this case, ASMR whispering is causing the author anxiety. The author is trying to maintain their own well-being by setting boundaries in their shared space. The boyfriend's response of using earphones shows he's making an effort to accommodate the author's needs. \n\nIt's important to consider that in a shared living situation, both parties need to make adjustments. The author isn't being unreasonable by asking for a quieter and darker environment for sleep. The boyfriend's habits are his preference, but respecting the partner's health and comfort is essential. Since the author has communicated their feelings and provided evidence of a medical issue, it's reasonable for them to set these boundaries.\n\nNo one is entirely without fault here, but the author's actions are justified in protecting their own mental health. The boyfriend is also making an effort to comply, which suggests a willingness to adjust. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
