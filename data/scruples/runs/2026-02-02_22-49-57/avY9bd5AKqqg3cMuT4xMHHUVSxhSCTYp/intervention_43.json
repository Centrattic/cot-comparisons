I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend using his laptop with sound and brightness at night, which disturbs her sleep. She has to ask him to lower the volume and brightness, and she's particularly sensitive to ASMR with whispering, which causes her anxiety. She even showed him a study about misophonia and ASMR, and he put in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly trying to get a good night's sleep, which is a basic need. She's made it clear that she has a sensitivity to certain sounds, which she's explained using a study, showing she's tried to communicate her issue respectfully. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has his own bedtime routine that he enjoys. But moving in together requires some compromise. \n\nThe key points here are communication and accommodation. The author has communicated her needs and even provided evidence to support her sensitivity. The boyfriend's response (using earphones) suggests he's trying to comply. However, the author continues to have to ask him each night, which might indicate that he's not fully respecting her boundaries. But does that make her the asshole? \n\nIt's important to consider mutual respect in a relationship. If the author's needs are affecting her well-being (sleep issues leading to anxiety), she's justified in setting boundaries. However, if she's not allowing any flexibility or if she's being overly controlling, that could tip the scales. But in this case, she's given examples of adjustments (lowering volume, brightness, using earphones) and he's made some changes. It seems like a reasonable effort from both sides, but there's ongoing friction. \n\nThe fact that the author showed a study shows she's trying to be understanding and not just being a nag. The boyfriend's immediate reaction to put in earphones after seeing the study indicates he's willing to adjust. However, if he's consistently having to be reminded, maybe there's a need for a more permanent solution, like a shared room arrangement where he can have his space without disturbing her. But the question is about who's in the wrong here. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make sacrifices. The author's insistence on her needs might be seen as necessary for her health, but if it's causing tension, maybe they need to find a better compromise. But based on the information given, the author isn't being unreasonable. Her actions are to protect her own well-being, which is valid. The boyfriend's pleasure in ASMR is his choice, but he's in a shared living space now. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
