I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about their boyfriend's bedtime habits and how they're affecting the author.\n\nFirst, the author needs silence and darkness to sleep, which is their bedtime routine. The boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR, which the author finds particularly bothersome. They mention feeling anxious and trapped when hearing whispering ASMR. The author has tried communicating this, even showing a study about misophonia to the boyfriend, who then put in earphones. \n\nNow, the key points here. The author is setting boundaries, which is important in a relationship. They\u2019re not just making demands without reason; they have a specific condition (misophonia) that makes the ASMR uncomfortable. The boyfriend adjusted his behavior after being informed, which shows he's responsive. \n\nBut wait, is the author being too controlling? The boyfriend's habits are his \"guilty pleasure,\" so maybe the author is infringing on his comfort. However, the author's needs are also valid. The fact that the author communicates their needs calmly and provides evidence (the study) suggests they're trying to be understanding. The boyfriend's reaction (putting in earphones) indicates he's willing to compromise. \n\nIs there a balance here? It seems like both are adjusting. The author isn't forcing the boyfriend to stop entirely but is asking for adjustments that respect their own needs. Since they've moved in together, establishing shared boundaries is part of cohabitation. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the boyfriend doesn't like being asked but still complies. That shows some tension, but the author isn't unreasonable. Misophonia is a recognized condition, so their sensitivity to certain sounds is legitimate. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. They're advocating for their health and well-being, which is necessary. The boyfriend's adjustment shows willingness to accommodate. So the answer should be B.\n"
