I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to lower his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep. The author also mentions that their boyfriend listens to ASMR, which makes them anxious because of misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The couple just moved in together. The author has specific needs for sleep: silence and darkness. The boyfriend has a different bedtime routine involving a laptop. The author is setting boundaries by asking him to adjust the volume and brightness. That seems reasonable because the author's well-being is at stake. The boyfriend's habits are affecting the author's ability to sleep, which is a basic need. \n\nMisophonia is a real condition where certain sounds trigger strong negative reactions. The author has explained this to their boyfriend, who then uses earphones. The boyfriend's actions here show he's responsive to feedback. \n\nIs the author being too demanding? They are asking for adjustments that help them sleep, not completely banning the boyfriend's habits. The boyfriend is complying when asked. It's about mutual respect and accommodation. The author isn't the asshole because they're managing their health and communicating their needs. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure doesn't override the author's need for a good night's sleep. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
