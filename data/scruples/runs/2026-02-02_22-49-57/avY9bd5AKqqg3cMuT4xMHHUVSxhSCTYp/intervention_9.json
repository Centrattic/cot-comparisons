I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend whose bedtime routine involves watching YouTube or ASMR on his laptop, which the author finds disruptive. The author has misophonia, specifically triggered by whispering ASMR, making them feel anxious and irritated. They've asked him to adjust the volume, brightness, etc., and showed him a study. The boyfriend responds by rolling away and using earphones.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is the asshole. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate health issue (misophonia), which is a real condition that can cause significant distress. They're trying to communicate their needs to live comfortably in their shared space. They've given examples like adjusting volume and brightness, which are reasonable requests. They also provided evidence from a study to explain why the ASMR affects them, which is a mature approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that his preferences are being restricted. However, when you live with someone, you both have to make adjustments. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) seems like a reasonable compromise. The author isn't forbidding him from doing ASMR entirely, just asking for adjustments when they're trying to sleep. It's about mutual respect for each other's needs.\n\nThe key points here are the author's health condition, their attempts to communicate and find solutions, and the boyfriend's response. Since the author is making specific, reasonable requests that don't completely prevent the boyfriend from engaging in his activity (just modifying it to be less intrusive), it's more about accommodating a health issue. The boyfriend's reaction is a compromise, but the author's actions are about maintaining their well-being and good sleep, which is important for their health.\n\nMisophonia is a recognized condition, so the author isn't being unreasonable. They are asserting their needs in a respectful way. The boyfriend's response (using earphones) shows he's trying to comply, but maybe the author still feels it's not enough. However, the author is within their rights to ask for adjustments to their shared living space. There's no indication that the author is being overly controlling or unreasonable beyond what's necessary for their health and comfort.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
