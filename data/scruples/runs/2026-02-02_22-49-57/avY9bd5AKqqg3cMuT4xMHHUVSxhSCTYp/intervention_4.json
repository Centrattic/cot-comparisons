I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The person is moving in with their boyfriend and has different bedtime routines. The author wants silence and darkness, but the boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR, which they find really annoying because of their misophonia, especially with whispering.\n\nFirst, the author is asking the boyfriend to adjust the volume and brightness. That seems reasonable because they need a quiet and dark environment to sleep. It's common for roommates or partners to have different needs, and asking to lower the volume or use earphones is a typical request. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he's trying to accommodate, but maybe not fully considering the author's feelings.\n\nThe author also mentioned showing a study about misophonia and ASMR, which indicates they're trying to explain the issue isn't just personal dislike but a real condition. That's a valid approach to help the boyfriend understand. The key point is whether the author is being unreasonable in their requests. Since they're making specific, reasonable adjustments (lower volume, brightness, using earphones) to respect each other's needs, it doesn't seem like they're in the wrong. The boyfriend's guilt about his pleasure (ASMR) might be internal, but the author's health and comfort are important. So the answer is probably B.\n"
