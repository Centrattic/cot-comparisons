I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who uses his laptop with sound and brightness on during bedtime, which disturbs the author's need for silence and darkness. The author has misophonia, specifically reacting badly to whispering ASMR, which makes her anxious and uncomfortable. She's asked him to adjust his habits, and he did after she showed him a study. She's questioning if she's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author has a legitimate health condition (misophonia) that causes her distress when exposed to certain sounds like whispering. She's communicated her needs clearly and even provided evidence through a study. The boyfriend did make changes after being informed. The author isn't forbidding him from using his laptop entirely but is asking for adjustments that accommodate both their needs. \n\nOn the other hand, moving in together means both need to compromise. The boyfriend's bedtime routine is important to him, so maybe there's a balance to find. But the author's request seems reasonable given her condition. Misophonia is recognized, and it's not just a personal preference. The author isn't being overly controlling; she's addressing specific issues that affect her well-being. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's willing to comply, which is a positive step. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. She's managing her health needs and has made efforts to communicate. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, but the author isn't banning him from it entirely, just adjusting when she's trying to sleep. It's a matter of mutual respect and accommodation. The answer should be B.\n"
