I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop habits to accommodate their sleep needs.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they have misophonia, specifically triggered by whispering ASMR. They've shown research to their boyfriend, who then puts earphones in. That seems like a reasonable response. The boyfriend's reaction might indicate he's trying to respect their request.\n\nThey moved in together, so adjusting to each other's routines is expected. The author's needs for silence and darkness are legitimate. They're not just being picky; it's about health and well-being. The boyfriend's bedtime routine is causing them anxiety and discomfort, which is significant.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) when told about the ASMR issue shows he's trying to comply. However, the author still feels they have to ask repeatedly. Maybe there's a communication gap or understanding. But the author isn't being unreasonable here. They're setting clear boundaries for their health.\n\nOn the other side, the boyfriend might be frustrated if he feels his preferences aren't being respected. But the author isn't banning all his activities\u2014just adjusting volume and brightness. It's about cohabitation and mutual respect. Since the author has a valid medical condition (misophonia), their requests are justified.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. They're advocating for their needs in a shared living space, especially with a valid condition. The boyfriend's compliance shows he's trying, but the author's persistence in asking is necessary for their well-being.\n"
