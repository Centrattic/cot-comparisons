I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they moved in together, and the boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using his laptop with ASMR, which the author finds really irritating. The author asks him to turn down the sound and brightness, and they even told him about their misophonia related to whispering ASMR. The boyfriend responds by putting in earphones and rolling away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a right to a peaceful sleep environment. If the boyfriend's activities are causing distress, it's reasonable to ask for adjustments. Misophonia is a real condition, and the author's reaction to whispering ASMR is legitimate. They shared a study, which shows they're trying to communicate their needs clearly.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might be using the laptop as a way to unwind, and he might feel his needs are being ignored. But since they live together, it's about finding a compromise. The author isn't asking for a complete ban but adjustments like lower volume and brightness. The boyfriend's response of using earphones suggests he's trying to accommodate, but maybe the author feels it's not enough.\n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. The author is expressing their needs, which is important. The boyfriend's reaction (putting on earphones) shows he's making an effort. However, if the author continues to feel disturbed, maybe more discussion is needed. But based on the information given, the author isn't being unreasonable. They have a valid health-related reason, and they're trying to work things out. So the answer is probably B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
