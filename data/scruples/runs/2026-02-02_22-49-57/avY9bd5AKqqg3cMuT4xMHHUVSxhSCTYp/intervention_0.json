I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage when they're trying to sleep, especially regarding ASMR and whispering. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions they need silence and darkness for their bedtime routine, which is completely valid. People have different needs when it comes to sleeping. They\u2019ve tried to accommodate the boyfriend's habits by letting him watch YouTube or listen to ASMR but are bothered by the sound and brightness. \n\nThe boyfriend's routine is his \"guiltiest pleasure,\" which might mean he really enjoys it and it helps him relax. However, the author's discomfort is significant\u2014misophonia can cause real anxiety and irritation. They showed him a study, which he then acted on by using earphones. That suggests he understood the issue and made a change.\n\nIs it reasonable to ask someone to adjust for the sake of sleep? I think yes. Sleep is crucial, and if one partner's habits are interfering with the other's well-being, it's fair to set boundaries. The author isn't being demanding but communicating their needs. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) shows he tried to comply. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the boyfriend feels his needs aren't respected, but the author isn't forbidding him from doing it entirely\u2014just adjusting when the author is trying to sleep. It's a shared space, so mutual adjustments are necessary. \n\nI don't see the author being unreasonable. They're not asking him to stop entirely, just to modify his behavior in their shared bedroom. The boyfriend could also consider using a white noise machine or sleeping in a different room if the adjustments aren't enough. But based on the information given, the author's actions seem justified. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
