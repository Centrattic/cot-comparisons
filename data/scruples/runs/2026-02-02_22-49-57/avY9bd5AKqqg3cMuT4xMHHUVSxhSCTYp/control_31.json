I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to lower his laptop volume and brightness when they're trying to sleep, especially when the boyfriend listens to ASMR which the author finds uncomfortable due to misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has just moved in together. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using his laptop with sounds, maybe ASMR, which the author has misophonia towards whispers. The author has communicated their discomfort, shown research, and the boyfriend responds by putting in earphones. The author is asking if they're being unreasonable.\n\nSo, the key factors here: the author has a medical condition (misophonia) that makes certain sounds, like whispering in ASMR, uncomfortable. They\u2019ve communicated this to their partner. The boyfriend is adjusting by using earphones, which seems like a reasonable compromise. The author is asking if they\u2019re wrong for setting these boundaries.\n\nMisophonia is a real condition, so the author's sensitivity is valid. They\u2019re not just being picky but have a legitimate reason for their discomfort. The boyfriend's response of using earphones shows he's trying to accommodate. The author is asking about their actions, which involve requesting adjustments for their well-being. Setting boundaries in a shared living space is normal, especially when health is involved.\n\nBut maybe someone could argue that the author is being too controlling? However, considering the health aspect and that the boyfriend is making changes to accommodate, it seems the author isn't the asshole. They\u2019re advocating for their needs, which is understandable. The boyfriend's guilt about his \"pleasure\" might indicate some pressure, but since he's adjusting, it's more about mutual respect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
