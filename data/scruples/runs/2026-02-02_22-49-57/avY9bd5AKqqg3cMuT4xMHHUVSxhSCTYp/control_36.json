  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a person who moved in with their boyfriend. They have different bedtime routines. The author needs silence and darkness, while the boyfriend uses his laptop for YouTube or ASMR, which he really likes. The author asks him to turn down the sound and brightness, which the boyfriend doesn't like. The main issue is with whispering ASMR, which the author has misophonia towards, causing anxiety and discomfort. The author showed a study to the boyfriend, who then put in earphones.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is the asshole (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, let me recall what misophonia is. It's a condition where certain sounds trigger strong emotional or physiological responses. Whispering can be a trigger, so if the author has that, it's a legitimate issue. The boyfriend's ASMR is his \"guiltiest pleasure,\" which might mean he really enjoys it, but the author is affected by it.\n\nThe author is asking him to adjust his routine, which is reasonable if the boyfriend is in the same room. The boyfriend's response is to roll away and use earphones after being shown the study. It seems like he acknowledged the issue and took steps, but maybe he's still annoyed because he can't do his ASMR as he wants. \n\nThe author is asking for reasonable accommodations: lower volume, less brightness, etc. It's a shared living space, so both need to make some adjustments. The fact that the author explained their condition and provided a study shows they're trying to be understanding. The boyfriend might feel his needs aren't being respected, but the author's needs (due to a medical condition) are valid. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're addressing a legitimate health issue. The boyfriend's reaction of putting on earphones is a compromise, but maybe he's not happy. However, the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries to protect their well-being. \n\nSo I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason related to their health and are communicating their needs, which is necessary in a shared living situation."
