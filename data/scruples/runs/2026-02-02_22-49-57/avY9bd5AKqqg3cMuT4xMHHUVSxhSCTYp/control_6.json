I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple moving in together, and the author is asking their boyfriend to turn down his laptop's sound and brightness because it's affecting their sleep. The boyfriend watches YouTube or listens to ASMR, which the author finds uncomfortable, especially the whispering parts. They mention misophonia and showed a study to the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is trying to communicate their needs for a quiet and dark environment. They're not just being annoying; they have a specific sensitivity (misophonia) that makes certain sounds distressing. The boyfriend's reaction was to put on earphones, which seems like he tried to accommodate. But the author feels they're being unreasonable because they keep asking for adjustments.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of a relationship, when two people move in together, they need to compromise. The author is trying to set boundaries for their own well-being. If the boyfriend is doing something that affects the author's health (like causing anxiety through misophonia), then the author has a valid reason to ask for changes. The boyfriend's guilt about his \"pleasure\" (ASMR) might make him feel defensive, but the author's health and comfort are important.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have discussed this earlier or found a middle ground. For example, using different sides of the bed, or maybe the boyfriend could use a white noise machine instead. But the author is making reasonable requests, and the boyfriend is making efforts by using earphones. \n\nThe study on misophonia and ASMR adds credibility to the author's feelings, not just being overly sensitive. Since the author is not asking for everything to stop but rather adjustments to minimize disturbance, it seems reasonable. The boyfriend's immediate reaction to roll away and use earphones shows he's trying, but maybe there's more to discuss about compromising. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should respect each other's needs. The author is not being selfish; they're addressing a genuine issue that affects their health. The boyfriend might need to find a way to enjoy his ASMR without disturbing the author, but the author is within their rights to ask for accommodations. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
