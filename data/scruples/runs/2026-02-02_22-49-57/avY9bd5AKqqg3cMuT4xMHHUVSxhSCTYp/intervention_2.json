I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's boyfriend using his laptop with sound and brightness late at night, which bothers the author because she needs silence and darkness to sleep. She has misophonia when it comes to whispering ASMR, and she's told him that. The boyfriend seems to comply when she asks, but she's wondering if she's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author has a legitimate sensitivity to certain sounds (misophonia), which is a real condition. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves activities that her environment needs. She's communicating her needs and he's making adjustments, like using earphones. The question is whether she's overstepping by asking for these changes.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are crucial. The author is advocating for her health and comfort, which is important. The boyfriend is adjusting his behavior to accommodate her needs, which shows he's responsive. However, it's also important to consider if there's a middle ground or if the boyfriend's needs are being addressed. But the scenario doesn't mention any conflict or refusal from his side. He's complying when asked.\n\nThe author isn't making demands but asking for reasonable adjustments that don't infringe on the boyfriend's rights. Since he's willing to comply, it seems like a healthy dynamic. There's no indication that the author is being inconsiderate; she's managing her own needs while respecting his habits as much as possible. Therefore, the answer is likely B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
