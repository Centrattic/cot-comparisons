I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a boyfriend who uses his laptop with sound and brightness on at night, which is bothering the author's sleep. The author has misophonia, especially when it comes to whispering ASMR, which makes them feel anxious and unsettled. They've tried to communicate this to their boyfriend and shown him a study about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has a legitimate health issue\u2014misophonia\u2014that causes real discomfort. They've moved in together, so there's a shared living space. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves activities that the author finds problematic. The author has asked him to make adjustments, like turning down the volume and brightness, using earphones, etc. The boyfriend does comply, but maybe the author feels it's not enough or that they're being too strict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about mutual respect and communication. The author is clearly expressing their needs and explaining their condition. That's a responsible approach. They're not just making demands without cause. They've taken the step of sharing a study, which shows they're trying to educate their partner about their condition. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and putting in earphones) suggests he's trying to accommodate, but maybe the underlying issue is that he dislikes being asked repeatedly.\n\nBut wait, when someone has a medical condition that affects their well-being, it's reasonable to request accommodations. Misophonia is real and can cause significant distress. So the author's requests are justified. However, the boyfriend might feel that his own needs (using his laptop in bed) are being restricted. The challenge is finding a balance where both partners can coexist comfortably. The author isn't forbidding him from doing these things entirely; they're just asking for adjustments that minimize the impact on their sleep. That seems fair.\n\nIs there a point where the author is being too controlling? If the boyfriend is compliant and the author's requests are necessary for their health, then it's not about control but about coexistence. The boyfriend might feel frustrated if he feels his preferences are being disregarded, but the author's health issue takes precedence. The key here is that the author is communicating and seeking solutions, which is the right approach. They're not being inconsiderate; they're being proactive about their well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Their actions are based on a legitimate medical need and they're making reasonable requests. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure (ASMR) is being addressed in a way that respects both their needs. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
