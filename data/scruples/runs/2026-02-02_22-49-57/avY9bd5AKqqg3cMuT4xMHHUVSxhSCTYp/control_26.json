I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR watching habits to accommodate their need for silence and darkness for sleep. The boyfriend's routine involves watching YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds disturbing due to misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a legitimate need for a quiet and dark environment to sleep, which is important for their health. They mention that they showed the boyfriend a study linking misophonia and ASMR, which caused him to use earphones. That shows they tried to communicate their needs and got a positive reaction initially.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine that he's used to. Moving in together probably means both have to adjust. The author's requests are reasonable\u2014asking to turn down the volume and brightness. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling over and using earphones suggests he's willing to comply, so maybe the issue is more about the frequency of the requests than the requests themselves.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual adjustment. The author isn't forbidding the boyfriend entirely but is asking for adjustments that don't interfere with their sleep. Since the boyfriend is making changes when asked, it seems like a respectful approach. The author's actions are about health and well-being, which are valid concerns. The boyfriend's \"guilty pleasure\" being ASMR doesn't make it more important than the author's need to sleep. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their needs in a way that's considerate but also necessary. The boyfriend's willingness to adjust when asked also shows cooperation, so the author's actions are justified. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
