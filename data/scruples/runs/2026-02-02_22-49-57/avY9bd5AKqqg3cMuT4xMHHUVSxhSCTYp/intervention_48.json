I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's volume and brightness because it's affecting her sleep. She also has an issue with ASMR, specifically whispering ones, causing her anxiety and discomfort. They moved in together, so there's a new living arrangement to consider.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate need for silence and darkness to sleep, which is important for health. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds trigger negative reactions. She mentioned showing a study to her boyfriend, which he then took action by using earphones. That suggests he's trying to accommodate her.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine he's used to. The author is asking for adjustments, which might be a bit of a disruption for him. But the key here is whether her requests are unreasonable. Since she's explaining her medical condition and providing evidence, it's a valid reason. The boyfriend's reaction (putting in earphones) shows he's willing to compromise. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she's communicating her needs and her health is a priority. The boyfriend should be understanding and make adjustments as he's done. The fact that he's made changes after she showed the study indicates he's not unwilling to cooperate. So the answer should be B.\n"
