I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. They moved in together with their boyfriend. The boyfriend has a bedtime routine that involves watching YouTube, ASMR, or being on his laptop. The author is really bothered by the laptop's brightness and sound, especially when he listens to whisper-based ASMR. They end up asking him to adjust his setup each night, which he doesn't like.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author has a valid need for silence and darkness to sleep, which is a common requirement. They mention misophonia related to whispering, which is a real condition. They even showed a study to their boyfriend, which he took seriously and used earphones. That seems like a reasonable response.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own habits. But when you move in together, some compromises are necessary. The author isn't asking for a complete ban but for adjustments like turning down the volume, lowering brightness, or using earphones. These are practical solutions that shouldn't be too intrusive. The boyfriend's immediate reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he's willing to accommodate, which is good.\n\nThe key point is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since they're asking for things that are necessary for their well-being (sleep) and have a legitimate medical reason (misophonia), it's more about mutual adjustment. The author isn't being a jerk for setting boundaries. The boyfriend might need to be more accommodating, but the author isn't in the wrong here. They're making reasonable requests for a shared living situation.\n"
