I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author moved in with their boyfriend, and there's a conflict about bedtime routines. The boyfriend uses his laptop in bed, sometimes with ASMR that has whispering, which the author finds really uncomfortable. The author has explained their issues, even showed a study about misophonia and ASMR, and the boyfriend adjusted his behavior by using earphones. The author keeps asking him to turn down the sound and brightness, which is causing some tension because the boyfriend doesn't like it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider misophonia. It's a real condition where specific sounds trigger strong negative emotions. Whispering is a common trigger. The author is being upfront about their needs and has provided evidence. The boyfriend's response of using earphones seems like a reasonable compromise. \n\nBut the author is asking if they're in the wrong for consistently requesting these adjustments. While it's understandable to want a peaceful sleep environment, the boyfriend might be feeling his preferences are being dismissed. However, the author has valid health reasons (misophonia) for their requests. The key here is that the author is communicating their needs and the boyfriend is making an effort to comply, like using earphones. \n\nMaybe the author could explore other solutions too, like different bed arrangements or white noise machines. But the question is about being in the wrong. The author isn't being unreasonable; they have a documented sensitivity. The boyfriend's guilt over his preference being a problem isn't necessarily the author's fault. So the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
