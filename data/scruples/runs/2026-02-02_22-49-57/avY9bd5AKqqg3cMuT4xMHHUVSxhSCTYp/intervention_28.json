I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's brightness and volume when they're trying to sleep. The boyfriend listens to ASMR, which the author has misophonia towards, especially whispering.\n\nFirst, moving in together means sharing a space, so adjusting each other's habits is normal. The author has a medical condition (misophonia) that makes whispering uncomfortable. They tried to communicate this by showing a study, which is reasonable. The boyfriend didn't take it seriously at first but then put in earphones. That suggests he's trying to accommodate. The author is asking for adjustments that are necessary for their well-being. It's about respecting each other's needs in a shared living situation. Since they're in a relationship, it's expected both make some compromises. The author isn't being unreasonable because they have a valid medical reason. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
