I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's boyfriend using his laptop at night, which includes ASMR with whispering, and the author feeling anxious and trapped because of it. They've asked him to turn down the volume and brightness, and he's responded by putting in earphones and moving away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a medical condition, misophonia, which makes certain sounds, like whispering, very uncomfortable. They've informed the boyfriend about this and even showed a study. The boyfriend is using earphones now, which suggests he's making an effort. The author is asking for reasonable accommodations in their shared living space, especially since they just moved in together. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions are his personal preference (ASMR), but the author's well-being and sleep are being affected. It's a common issue in relationships where one person's habits interfere with the other's needs. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're asking for adjustments that are necessary for their health. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones indicates he's trying to comply, so the author isn't being harsh without cause. \n\nI should check if there's any evidence the author is overstepping. The requests are specific and related to shared living conditions. Since misophonia is a recognized condition, the author's needs are valid. The boyfriend might need to adjust further, but the author isn't in the wrong here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
