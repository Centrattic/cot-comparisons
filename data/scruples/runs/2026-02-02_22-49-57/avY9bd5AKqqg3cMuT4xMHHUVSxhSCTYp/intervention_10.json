I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the boyfriend's bedtime routine conflicting with the author's need for silence and darkness. The author mentions having misophonia, specifically with whispering ASMR, and has shown the boyfriend a study about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is moving in together, so this is a shared living space. They've communicated their needs clearly, even showing research to support their sensitivity. The boyfriend responds by putting in earphones, which seems like a reasonable compromise. The author is asking for adjustments that are necessary for their well-being, which is valid, especially with a condition like misophonia. \n\nThe boyfriend might feel his habits are being restricted, but the author isn't banning all activities\u2014just specific ones that cause discomfort. The author is making efforts to find solutions (like asking to turn down the volume, brightness, etc.) and the boyfriend is complying to some extent. It's about mutual respect and accommodation. Since the author has a health-related issue, it's more about the boyfriend adjusting rather than the author being unreasonable. \n\nI don't see the author being inconsiderate. They are communicating their needs and seeking solutions. The boyfriend's reaction (putting in earphones) shows he's trying to accommodate. The author isn't demanding total silence but asking for adjustments that help them sleep. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
