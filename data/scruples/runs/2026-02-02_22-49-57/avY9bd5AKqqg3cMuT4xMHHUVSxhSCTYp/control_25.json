I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple moving in together, where the author asks their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness because it's affecting their sleep. The boyfriend's preference is watching YouTube or ASMR, especially whispering ASMR, which the author has misophonia and finds really irritating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a valid reason: they need silence and darkness to sleep, and they have a condition (misophonia) that makes whispering ASMR particularly problematic. They've communicated their needs and even provided research to explain their sensitivity. The boyfriend's reaction is to put earphones in, which seems like he's trying to accommodate, but maybe not entirely satisfied.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's routine is important to him, and the author is constantly reminding him to adjust, which could be stressful for him. The question is whether the author is overstepping by insisting on these changes every night. However, since they moved in together, it's reasonable for both to adjust their habits. The author isn't asking for the boyfriend to stop entirely but to modify the volume and brightness. The use of earphones and rolling over are practical solutions. Also, the author's health and comfort are a priority, which is important.\n\nMisophonia is a recognized condition, so the author's discomfort isn't just personal preference but a medical issue. The boyfriend's willingness to put on earphones after being shown the study suggests he's making an effort. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're setting boundaries for their well-being. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and putting in earphones) might indicate he's not happy, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for advocating for their needs.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They are managing a health issue by communicating their needs, which is essential in a shared living situation. The boyfriend's adjustment is necessary for the author's comfort, and the solutions proposed are reasonable. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
