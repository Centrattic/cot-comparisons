I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening habits to accommodate their need for silence and darkness at bedtime.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple just moved in together. The boyfriend uses his laptop at night, sometimes watching YouTube or listening to ASMR, which the author finds disturbing. The author has a condition called misophonia, which makes certain sounds, like whispering ASMR, cause anxiety and discomfort. The author communicates this to the boyfriend, who responds by using earphones. The author is concerned about being an asshole for setting these boundaries.\n\nNow, considering typical social norms and relationship dynamics, setting boundaries is usually a healthy part of any relationship. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which is reasonable. Misophonia is a recognized condition, so the author's sensitivity isn't just being overly particular. The boyfriend's response (using earphones) suggests he's willing to comply, so there's no resistance from his side. \n\nThe key points here are: the author is asking for adjustments that are necessary for their well-being, they've explained the reason (misophonia), and the boyfriend is accommodating. There's no indication that the author is being unreasonable or that their requests are excessive. In fact, mutual accommodation is expected in a healthy relationship. The boyfriend isn't being forced to stop his habits entirely, just to modify them in a way that respects the author's space.\n\nOn the flip side, if the author were making unreasonable demands without explanation, that might be different. But here, they're providing context and the boyfriend is responding positively. The author isn't in the wrong for advocating for their needs, especially when those needs are based on a legitimate health condition. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not the asshole).\n"
