I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep, especially because the boyfriend listens to ASMR that causes the author discomfort due to misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has specific needs for a quiet and dark environment to sleep, which is reasonable. They've communicated these needs to their boyfriend, who has his own bedtime routine involving his laptop. The boyfriend's actions are causing the author anxiety and discomfort, so they're asking him to make adjustments. The boyfriend does comply when asked, like using earphones, which shows he's responsive to her requests.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking these adjustments. From a general perspective, in a relationship, partners are expected to accommodate each other's needs if they can. The author is expressing her boundaries and health concerns, which are valid, especially since she has misophonia. The fact that she provided a study to explain her condition shows she's trying to educate him, which is a good approach.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014rolling away and using earphones\u2014indicates he's making an effort. However, the author might feel that the boyfriend isn't fully empathetic or that her needs aren't being prioritized. But the author isn't demanding he stop entirely; she's asking for adjustments that are reasonable and that he can do without much trouble.\n\nOn the flip side, the boyfriend might feel his own needs for relaxation (ASMR) are being ignored. But since the author's health and comfort are affected, her requests are justified. It's a balance between both partners' needs. Since the boyfriend is making changes when asked, the author isn't being unreasonable. The core issue is communication and mutual adjustment, which seems to be happening here.\n\nLooking at the options, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's advocating for her health and has made efforts to explain her condition. The boyfriend is complying, so the author's actions are reasonable.\n"
