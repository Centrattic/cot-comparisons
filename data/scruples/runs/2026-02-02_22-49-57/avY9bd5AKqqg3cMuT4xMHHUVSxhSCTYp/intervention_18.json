I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR when they're trying to sleep. The author mentions they have misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort. They've explained this to their boyfriend, who then uses earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple moved in together, so establishing boundaries is part of that process. The author is trying to communicate their needs to get a good night's sleep, which is important for health. The boyfriend's habits are affecting the author's well-being. The author isn't just being sensitive but has a specific condition (misophonia) that makes this a legitimate issue.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of putting in earphones after being informed suggests he's trying to accommodate. The author is asking for reasonable adjustments, not eliminating his habits entirely. It's about mutual respect and finding solutions that work for both. Since the author has explained their medical condition and the boyfriend is making efforts, it seems the author isn't being unreasonable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
