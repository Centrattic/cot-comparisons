I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness so they can sleep, especially because the boyfriend's ASMR (specifically whispering) makes the author feel anxious and unsettled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and boyfriend just moved in together, so there's a new living situation that requires adjusting to each other's habits. The author has a bedtime routine that requires silence and darkness, while the boyfriend uses his laptop for YouTube or ASMR. The author feels that the boyfriend's activities are disturbing their sleep and well-being, so they ask him to lower the volume, adjust brightness, etc. The boyfriend seems to comply when asked, but the author is concerned they might be overstepping.\n\nNow, the key points here are:\n\n1. The author is trying to communicate their needs regarding sleep and comfort. They've explained their misophonia related to whispering ASMR and provided research. The boyfriend, after being informed, uses earphones, which suggests he respects her request.\n\n2. The author's requests are about their personal space and health. Sleep is crucial, and if the environment is affecting that, it's reasonable to ask for adjustments. The boyfriend isn't ignoring the requests; he's complying, albeit maybe reluctantly.\n\n3. The author hasn't outright forbidden the boyfriend from watching ASMR; they're just asking for adjustments when they're in the same space. It's about mutual respect for each other's needs. The boyfriend could also use earphones from the start if he prefers, which might prevent the need for repeated requests.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say the author is being too controlling, but given the health impact (misophonia causing anxiety), it's a valid concern. The boyfriend's pleasure shouldn't override the author's well-being. Also, since they live together, compromise is necessary. The author isn't banning the activity entirely, just modifying how it's done in shared space.\n\nIn the AITA context, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're advocating for their health and sleep needs, and the boyfriend is making adjustments, the author seems justified. The boyfriend's guilt about it might be his issue to resolve, but the author isn't being unreasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
