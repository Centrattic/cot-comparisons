I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the boyfriend's bedtime routine involving loud laptop sounds and ASMR, which the author finds uncomfortable. The author asks him to adjust the volume, brightness, etc., and specifically mentions that whispering ASMR makes them anxious. They showed him a study about misophonia and ASMR, and he responded by putting in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a legitimate sensitivity (misophonia) which is causing discomfort. They're trying to communicate their needs to their partner. The boyfriend's actions are part of his bedtime routine, but the author's needs are about their own well-being. \n\nIn relationships, especially after moving in together, communication and mutual respect are crucial. The author isn't making demands but is trying to find a middle ground. They're not asking him to stop entirely but to adjust in ways that don't interfere with their sleep, like using headphones or turning down the volume. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's made an effort, but maybe not enough. \n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole. The author is advocating for their own comfort, which is reasonable. Misophonia is a real condition, so their feelings are valid. However, it's also important that the boyfriend has his own needs. But the author isn't unreasonable here; they're asking for adjustments that are common in cohabiting situations. The boyfriend might need to accommodate a bit more, but the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They\u2019re addressing a legitimate issue and communicating their needs. The boyfriend should be more considerate, but the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
