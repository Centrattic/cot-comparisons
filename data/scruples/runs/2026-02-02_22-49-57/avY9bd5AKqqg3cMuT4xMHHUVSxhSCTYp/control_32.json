I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop habits when they're trying to sleep. The key points here are the boyfriend's bedtime routine involving YouTube, ASMR, and laptop use, while the author needs silence and darkness.\n\nFirst, moving in together can present challenges in adjusting to each other's habits. The author mentions they knew about his habits beforehand but didn't know how it would work out. They've tried letting him watch but end up asking for adjustments. The boyfriend doesn't seem happy with these requests, and there's a specific issue with ASMR causing anxiety due to misophonia.\n\nMisophonia is a recognized condition where certain sounds trigger negative emotions. The author shared research about it, which the boyfriend reacted to by putting in earphones. But the author is constantly asking for changes, which might be seen as nagging. However, the author has a valid reason related to their health and well-being.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's trying to comply, but maybe not in the way the author wants. The question is whether the author is overstepping by consistently asking for adjustments. However, since the author has a medical reason (misophonia) and they're living together, it's reasonable to expect some compromise. The boyfriend could also adjust his habits, like using a different room or headphones, which he's partially doing. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're communicating their needs and have a valid health issue. The boyfriend's guilt about ASMR is his issue, but the author's right to a good night's sleep is important. They both need to find a solution, but the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
