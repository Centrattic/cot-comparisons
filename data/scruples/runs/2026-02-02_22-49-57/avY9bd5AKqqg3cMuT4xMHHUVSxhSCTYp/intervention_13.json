I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep. The key points here are the living situation (they moved in together), the differing bedtime routines, and the specific issue with ASMR and misophonia.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they need silence and darkness for sleep, which is a valid need. The boyfriend uses a laptop with ASMR, which the author has misophonia to, especially whispering. Misophonia can cause real discomfort, so it's not just about being a bit noisey. The author has communicated their feelings and even provided a study to explain why the whispering affects them. The boyfriend's reaction was to put in earphones, which suggests he understood and tried to comply.\n\nThe question is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since they've made their needs clear and the boyfriend is making adjustments, it seems like a mutual effort to accommodate each other. The author isn't forbidding ASMR entirely, just specifying types that cause discomfort. It's reasonable to ask for adjustments when they're in the same room. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure shouldn't override the author's health and well-being. \n\nHowever, one might argue that the boyfriend could use headphones instead of earphones if earphones don't block enough noise. But the story says he used earphones after being told, so maybe that's the solution they've found. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're addressing a legitimate issue. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
