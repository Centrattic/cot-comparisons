I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their boyfriend's bedtime habits conflicting with their own. The author needs silence and darkness, while the boyfriend uses a laptop with sound and brightness. They ask him to adjust it, which he does, but the author is concerned about being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a specific need for a quiet and dark environment to sleep. They've communicated their discomfort, even showing a study about misophonia related to ASMR. The boyfriend responds by using earphones and adjusting his setup. That seems like a reasonable response.\n\nThe author's actions are about their own well-being. They're not being aggressive; they're asking for accommodations. The boyfriend is making changes, so the author isn't being unreasonable. The question of \"in the wrong\" usually hinges on whether someone is being inconsiderate or violating norms. Here, the author is setting boundaries for their health, which is valid. The boyfriend is accommodating, so the author isn't the asshole. So the answer should be B.\n"
