I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage when they're trying to sleep, especially regarding ASMR and whispering sounds. \n\nFirst, the main points from the scenario: They moved in together, so there's a shared living space. The boyfriend uses his laptop in bed with ASMR or YouTube, which the author finds disruptive. The author has misophonia triggered by whispering, causing anxiety and discomfort. They tried to communicate this, showed him a study, and he responded by using earphones.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author is making a reasonable request for a peaceful sleep environment. They're not forbidding his habits entirely, just asking to adjust volume and brightness. The boyfriend's response (using earphones) suggests he's willing to compromise. The author's health issue (misophonia) adds validity to their discomfort. \n\nIs the author overstepping? They\u2019re not asking him to stop entirely but to modify it in ways that don't harm him. The boyfriend seems to comply, so there's mutual adjustment. The key here is whether the author is being reasonable, which they are. The boyfriend could also explore alternatives like using a white noise machine if the ASMR is necessary. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're advocating for their well-being in a shared space. The boyfriend's habits are personal, but the author's needs are also valid, especially given the health aspect. The communication seems effective, leading to a solution.\n"
