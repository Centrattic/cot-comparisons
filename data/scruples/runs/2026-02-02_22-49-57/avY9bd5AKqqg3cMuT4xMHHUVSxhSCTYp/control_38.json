I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's volume and brightness when they're trying to sleep, especially regarding ASMR. They mention that the boyfriend's bedtime routine involves YouTube or ASMR, which is the opposite of the author's need for silence and darkness. The author has explained their discomfort, even showing a study about misophonia and ASMR. The boyfriend's reaction is to put in earphones and roll away.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is overstepping. The key points here are communication, boundaries, and mutual respect. The author is trying to communicate their needs and has tried to explain their discomfort with a study. The boyfriend's response is to use earphones, which suggests he's trying to accommodate. The author isn't outright banning the activity but is asking for adjustments. \n\nMisophonia is a real condition, so the author's sensitivity to certain sounds is valid. They're not asking for the boyfriend to stop using his laptop entirely but to make changes that allow both to coexist. The boyfriend's use of earphones after being shown the study indicates he's respecting the author's request. \n\nHowever, does the author have a reasonable expectation here? They moved in together, so adjusting routines is part of a healthy relationship. The author is setting clear boundaries, which is important for their well-being. The boyfriend isn't compliant every time, but the author is trying to find a middle ground. \n\nThe question is whether the author is being unfair. Since they're addressing a health issue and making adjustments that are feasible (earphones, lower volume), it seems reasonable. The boyfriend's actions show he's making an effort. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're advocating for their needs. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
