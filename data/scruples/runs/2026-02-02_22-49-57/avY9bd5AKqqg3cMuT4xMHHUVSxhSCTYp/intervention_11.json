I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening habits when they're trying to sleep. \n\nFirst, the author shares that they have misophonia, particularly with whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort. They mention showing a study about this to their partner. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using the laptop, which the author finds disruptive. They ask him to lower the volume, brightness, etc., but it seems like the boyfriend gets annoyed or avoids interaction by using earphones.\n\nNow, considering boundaries and mutual respect in a relationship. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which is important for a healthy relationship. The boyfriend's response of rolling away and using earphones might indicate he's not engaging with the problem constructively. The author isn't asking for anything unreasonable\u2014like eliminating his habit entirely\u2014but rather adjustments that don't interfere with their sleep.\n\nMisophonia is a real condition, and the author's sensitivity to certain sounds is valid. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure suggests he enjoys ASMR, but he needs to balance that with his partner's well-being. The fact that the author found a study and shared it shows they're trying to explain their feelings rationally.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel his needs aren't being considered, but the author isn't demanding he stop altogether. They\u2019re just asking for adjustments in volume and brightness. If the boyfriend isn't open to compromise, that's a red flag. The situation seems more about the boyfriend not respecting the author's boundaries than the author being in the wrong.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're advocating for their health and well-being, which is justified, especially when supported by research. The issue lies more with the boyfriend's lack of cooperation and understanding.\n"
