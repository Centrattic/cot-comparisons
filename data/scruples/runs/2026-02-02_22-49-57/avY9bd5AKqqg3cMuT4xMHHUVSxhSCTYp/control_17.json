I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's boyfriend using his laptop late at night with sound and brightness, which affects the author's sleep. The author has misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR, causing anxiety and discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a legitimate health issue\u2014misophonia. They've communicated their needs to the boyfriend, who initially resists but then complies after seeing a study. The author is asking if they're being unreasonable.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is part of his bedtime routine, but the author's needs are about health and well-being. The author is making reasonable requests: lower volume, brightness, using earphones. These aren't extreme. The boyfriend's reaction to the study and using earphones suggests he's trying to accommodate. However, the author is still upset because the boyfriend might not be fully compliant, leading to ongoing requests.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. Misophonia is a real condition, so their discomfort is valid. They've tried to communicate and adjust. The boyfriend is also adjusting his habits. If he's not fully compliant, maybe the communication needs to be clearer. But the author isn't being unreasonable here. The boyfriend's use of earphones is a solution, but maybe he's not using them consistently. The author's requests are about their health, so they aren't the asshole here. The boyfriend might need to be more considerate, but the author's actions are justified. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
