I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR habits when they're trying to sleep. The author mentions they have misophonia, especially towards whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The couple just moved in together, so establishing boundaries is part of adjusting to living together. The author is communicating their needs, which is important for a healthy relationship. They're not just making demands randomly; they have a legitimate health issue (misophonia) that's causing them distress. They also provided evidence from a study, which shows they tried to explain their condition rationally.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using his laptop, which he uses as a way to relax. The author is asking for adjustments, but maybe there's a middle ground. For example, using a sleep mask to block brightness or noise-canceling headphones for the ASMR. However, the author has already tried some solutions like covering the laptop and asking him to turn it down. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014rolling away and putting in earphones\u2014suggests he's trying to comply, but maybe not in a way that fully addresses the author's needs.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're advocating for their own well-being. Misophonia is a real condition, and it's reasonable to ask a partner to be accommodating. However, the constant requests might be wearing on the boyfriend, so communication is key. But the author isn't unreasonable; they are explaining their condition and trying to find a solution. So the answer is probably B, No, the author isn't in the wrong. They're just trying to coexist comfortably.\n"
