  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage during bedtime. The main points are about the author needing silence and darkness to sleep, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR and bright screen. The author has misophonia, which makes whispering ASMR particularly uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author has a valid health concern\u2014misophonia is a real condition that can cause distress from specific sounds. They\u2019re in a shared living space, so their needs are legitimate. On the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine that he's used to. But since they're sharing a bedroom now, adjustments are necessary for both to be comfortable.\n\nThe author is communicating their needs clearly, even showing a study to explain their discomfort. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he's making an effort. The author isn't banning all laptop use but is asking for specific adjustments like volume, brightness, and avoiding certain ASMR types. That seems reasonable.\n\nIs there a balance here? Both parties might need to compromise. The author isn't being unreasonable by setting boundaries in their own space. The boyfriend could also consider solutions like using headphones more often or maybe using a white noise machine if the silence is an issue. But the author isn't asking for that; they just want their space respected.\n\nAnother angle: when they moved in together, they should have discussed these differences beforehand. It's part of living together etiquette to address such things. The author isn't being overly controlling; they're addressing specific issues that affect their health. The boyfriend's guilt pleasure is being adjusted for the well-being of both. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're advocating for their needs, which is necessary in a relationship to maintain mutual respect and comfort.\n"
