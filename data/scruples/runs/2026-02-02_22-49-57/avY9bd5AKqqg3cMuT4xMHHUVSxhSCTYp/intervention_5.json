I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their relationship situation. The author has a boyfriend who uses his laptop at night\u2014watching YouTube or ASMR\u2014and the author is disturbed by the sound and brightness. They mention they have misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR, which causes anxiety and irritation. They've asked him to adjust his habits, like turning down the volume and brightness, using earphones, etc. The boyfriend doesn't seem happy about it.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion. I need to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, the author is clearly communicating their needs, which is important in any relationship. They have a legitimate sensitivity, misophonia, which is a real condition. They've tried to accommodate the boyfriend's routine but still face discomfort. The boyfriend is using the laptop in their shared space, so it's reasonable to expect adjustments to not disturb others. The author isn't banning all activities but is asking for reasonable changes. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's making some effort, but maybe not enough. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're explaining their feelings and showing research. So, the author is advocating for their well-being, which is valid. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
