I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend and his bedtime routine involving his laptop, which the author is trying to adjust because it affects her sleep. She has misophonia related to whispering ASMR, which makes her anxious and uncomfortable. She's asking him to lower the volume, dim the screen, etc. The question is whether she's the asshole (ITA) here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author moved in together, so there's a shared living space. She's made her needs clear\u2014silence and darkness for sleep. He's using the laptop, which she has to ask him to adjust. The problem escalates when he listens to ASMR, which she reacts negatively to. She shared a study about misophonia, and he reacted by moving away and using earphones.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, she's communicating her needs, which is reasonable. Misophonia is a real condition, and her reaction to certain sounds is valid. If she's explaining her needs and the health impact, it's reasonable to expect some accommodation. However, the boyfriend might feel his needs are also important. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong. \n\nFrom the story, she's not being unreasonable. She's trying to be accommodating by allowing him to watch or listen but just asks for adjustments to mitigate the disturbance. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) might indicate he's trying to comply. However, if he's resistant or if she's nagging, that could lead to conflict. But the author isn't claiming he's being inconsiderate beyond his initial actions. The fact that she provided a study suggests she's trying to be understanding and explain her condition, not just being a nag. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's advocating for her health and well-being in a shared living space, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's actions (using earphones) show he's making an effort, but the core issue is about her legitimate need for a sleep-conducive environment. The key here is that both need to find a middle ground, but she's not the one at fault for expressing her needs.\n"
