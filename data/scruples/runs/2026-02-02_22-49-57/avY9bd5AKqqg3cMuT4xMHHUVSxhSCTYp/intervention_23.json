I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend using his laptop at night, which disturbs her sleep and causes anxiety when he listens to ASMR, especially whispering ones. The author wants her boyfriend to lower the volume, brightness, etc., and she's communicated her discomfort about the ASMR. She's now wondering if she's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for a quiet, dark environment to sleep. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds cause distress, so her reaction to whispering ASMR isn't just being picky. She's tried to communicate this and even provided research, which shows she's making an effort to explain her side.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine he's used to. Moving in together means both need to make adjustments. If he's rolling away and using earphones after she explains her issues, that's a positive sign he's trying to accommodate. But maybe there are limits to how much he can adjust without feeling like his needs are ignored. However, the key here is whether the author is overstepping. She's not asking him to stop entirely, just to modify his behavior when she's trying to sleep. That's reasonable because shared spaces require mutual respect for each other's needs.\n\nAlso, the author isn't being aggressive; she's repeatedly asking and explaining her issues. The boyfriend's response of using earphones seems like a compromise. There's no indication that the author is being inconsiderate of his needs. Instead, she's focusing on her legitimate health and comfort needs. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
