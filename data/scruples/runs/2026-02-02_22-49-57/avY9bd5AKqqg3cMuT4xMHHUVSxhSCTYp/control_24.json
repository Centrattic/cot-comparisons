I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend and his bedtime habits conflicting with the author's needs.\n\nFirst, the author and her boyfriend moved in together. She needs silence and darkness to sleep, while he uses his laptop with ASMR or YouTube, which is noisy and bright. She asks him to turn down the volume and brightness, which he doesn't like. She also has a specific issue with whispering ASMR due to misophonia. She showed him a study, and he responded by using earphones.\n\nSo, the key points here are her health and comfort. Misophonia is a real condition, and the study she mentioned supports her sensitivity. She's making reasonable requests to adjust for her well-being. The boyfriend doesn't seem to be in the wrong here, as he's trying to accommodate by using earphones once he's aware. The author is advocating for her needs, which is justified, especially since she's given him information to understand her perspective better. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's not being unreasonable and is addressing her legitimate discomfort, the answer should be B (No). The boyfriend's reaction, while maybe not ideal, isn't the focus here. The author's actions are about her own needs, which she has a right to, especially in a shared living space. The study she showed him also helps him understand her condition, making her approach considerate. There's no indication she's being overly controlling without cause. Therefore, she's not the asshole.\n"
