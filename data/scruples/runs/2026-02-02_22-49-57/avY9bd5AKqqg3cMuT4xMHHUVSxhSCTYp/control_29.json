I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR consumption when they're trying to sleep. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They moved in together, and their bedtime routines conflict. The boyfriend uses his laptop with some noise and brightness, which the author finds distracting. The author has misophonia related to whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort. They've tried to communicate their needs, showing a study even, and the boyfriend responds by using earphones. But the author feels they're being pushy, while the boyfriend might be upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author is setting boundaries for their health and comfort, which is important. Misophonia is a real condition, and the study they showed the boyfriend supports their feelings. The boyfriend's reaction (putting in earphones) suggests he's trying to accommodate. However, the author is asking for repeated adjustments, which might be seen as nagging if not handled sensitively. But since they've communicated their needs and provided a reason, it's more about their well-being than being controlling. \n\nIs there a balance? The author isn't forbidding ASMR entirely but wants adjustments to coexist. The boyfriend isn't violating any rules; he's just following his routine. The author's actions are about their health, which is valid. Unless they're being unreasonable or not considering the boyfriend's needs at all, they're probably not the asshole here. The boyfriend could also try to find other times for ASMR or use a separate room. Since both have different needs, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for advocating for their comfort. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
