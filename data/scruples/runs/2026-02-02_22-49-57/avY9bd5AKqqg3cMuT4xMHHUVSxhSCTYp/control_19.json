I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is the asshole (AITA) for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR consumption when they're trying to sleep. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they have misophonia, specifically triggered by whispering ASMR, which causes anxiety and discomfort. They've shared a study with their boyfriend, who then uses earphones. But the author still has to ask him repeatedly to turn down the sound and brightness.\n\nThe boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using the laptop, which is a personal habit. The author's need for silence and darkness is valid, especially since they've moved in together. The conflict arises from differing needs in a shared living space. \n\nThe key points here are:\n1. The author has a legitimate health issue (misophonia) affecting their well-being.\n2. They've communicated their needs and provided evidence (the study) to explain their sensitivity.\n3. The boyfriend has made some adjustments (using earphones) but not all (brightness and physical position).\n4. The author feels they're nagging, which might be causing tension, but their requests are about their health and comfort.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) shows he's trying to accommodate, but maybe not enough. However, the author's persistent requests might be seen as reasonable given their health concerns. \n\nIn shared living situations, both partners need to make compromises. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their health, especially with evidence. The boyfriend should also consider the author's needs, perhaps by using a laptop with a matte screen for less glare or using a sleep mask. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a legitimate issue and have taken steps to communicate it. However, both could work on finding a middle ground, like specific times or areas for laptop use, to minimize disturbances. The boyfriend's guilt over his habits might be complicating things, but the author's health needs are valid.\n"
