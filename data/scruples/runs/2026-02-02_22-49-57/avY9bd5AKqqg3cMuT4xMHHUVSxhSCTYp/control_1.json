I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening habits to accommodate their sleep needs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple just moved in together, so there's a transition period. The author needs a quiet, dark environment to sleep, which is a common requirement. The boyfriend uses his laptop, including ASMR with whispering, which the author has misophonia towards. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds cause strong negative reactions, so that's a valid concern.\n\nThe author is communicating their needs, which is important in a relationship. They've shown the boyfriend a study about misophonia, which is a respectful way to explain their feelings. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) seems to be a direct response to the request, indicating he's making an effort.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine. The question is whether the author is overstepping by asking for adjustments. However, since they're in a shared living space, especially a bedroom, mutual adjustments are necessary. The author is trying to create a comfortable environment for both, not just themselves. \n\nThe key points are communication, medical validity of the issue, and mutual compromise. The author isn't forbidding the boyfriend from his activities entirely but is asking for adjustments that minimize disruption. Since the boyfriend is making changes, it suggests he's willing to compromise. The author's actions seem reasonable and considerate, given the health aspect of misophonia. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They\u2019re addressing a legitimate issue and seeking a solution that respects both their needs.\n"
