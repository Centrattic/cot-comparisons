I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple moving in together and dealing with differing bedtime routines. The boyfriend likes to watch YouTube or ASMR on his laptop, which the author finds disruptive, especially the whispering ASMR. The author asks him to lower the volume, adjust brightness, etc., which the boyfriend seems to dislike. The author mentions having misophonia related to whispering and showed a study to her boyfriend, who then put in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid health concern\u2014misophonia can be a real issue, causing anxiety and discomfort. She's communicating her needs, which is important in a relationship. On the other hand, the boyfriend has his own routine and might feel his needs are being ignored. The key here is whether the author is reasonable in her requests given the shared living space.\n\nSince they moved in together, they should have discussed and negotiated their routines. The author isn't forbidding him from doing his ASMR; she's asking him to adjust the volume and brightness to not disturb her. That's a common courtesy. Also, mentioning the study shows she's trying to explain her sensitivity, which is a good step. The boyfriend's reaction (putting in earphones) suggests he's making an effort, which is positive.\n\nThe question is if she's being unreasonable. Since she's accommodating by allowing him to do his things but asks for adjustments that don't take away his ability to enjoy them, it seems fair. The boyfriend's possible irritation is a normal reaction when someone asks for a change, but it's part of living together. The author isn't in the wrong here because she's asserting her needs in a healthy way. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
