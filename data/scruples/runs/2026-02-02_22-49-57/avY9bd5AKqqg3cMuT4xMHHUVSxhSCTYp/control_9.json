I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation is about the author living with their boyfriend. They have different bedtime routines. The author needs silence and darkness to sleep, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR, which the author finds irritating, especially the whispering part. The author asks him to lower the volume and brightness, and even showed a study about misophonia. The boyfriend's reaction was to put in earphones, but the author is wondering if they're being unreasonable.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about mutual accommodation in a relationship. Both people have different needs. The author is trying to communicate their discomfort, which is valid. ASMR can be soothing for some, but for others, it's stressful. The author mentions misophonia, which is a real condition, so that's a legitimate health issue. The boyfriend is adjusting by using earphones, which is a good compromise. \n\nBut wait, the author is asking if they're in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction to roll away and use earphones seems like he's making an effort. The author is setting boundaries, which is okay. However, if the author is constantly nagging without considering the boyfriend's needs, maybe that's a problem. But given the health aspect (misophonia), it's more about the author's need for a quiet environment to sleep. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance both partners' needs. The author isn't completely inconsiderate because they let him use his laptop, but they are also asserting their own needs. The boyfriend is making adjustments. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here because they're addressing a genuine issue with a health-related component. The boyfriend's compromise (earphones) seems sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have found a solution that doesn't involve constant requests, like using a white noise machine or separate bedding. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is communicating their needs and the boyfriend is adapting, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). However, if the author's requests are too frequent or harsh, that could be an issue. But given the context, the answer is B.\n"
