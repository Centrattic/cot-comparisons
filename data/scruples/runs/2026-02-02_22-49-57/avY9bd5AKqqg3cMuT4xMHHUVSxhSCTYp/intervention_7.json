I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's volume and brightness so they can sleep. The boyfriend's bedtime routine includes watching YouTube, ASMR, or using his laptop, which conflicts with the author's need for silence and darkness. The author mentions misophonia related to whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort.\n\nFirst, consider reasonable accommodations in a shared living space. Both partners should respect each other's needs. The author is asking for adjustments that are necessary for their well-being, not unreasonable demands. The boyfriend's activities are affecting her sleep, which is crucial for health. \n\nThen there's the part about ASMR and misophonia. The author shared a study showing the connection between the two, which the boyfriend responded to by putting in earphones. That seems like a good compromise. The boyfriend is making an effort to accommodate her, so the author isn't being inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend might feel his needs are being ignored. But since the author is suffering from anxiety and physical discomfort, her needs are legitimate. Communication is key here. The author is expressing their needs clearly, which is important. The boyfriend's immediate reaction to put on earphones suggests he's trying to be understanding.\n\nBut wait, is the author being too demanding? They mention it's every night. Maybe they should explore alternative solutions, like using a white noise machine or earplugs. But the boyfriend's adjustment (earphones) already addresses the issue. The author isn't asking for anything unreasonable. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they're advocating for their health and well-being, and the boyfriend is making an effort to comply. The key is mutual respect and finding solutions that work for both. So the answer should be B.\n"
