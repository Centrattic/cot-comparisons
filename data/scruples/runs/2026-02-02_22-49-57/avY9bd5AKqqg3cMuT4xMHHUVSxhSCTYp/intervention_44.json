I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR listening habits during bedtime. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their boyfriend just moved in together. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep, while the boyfriend likes to watch YouTube or listen to ASMR, especially whispering ones. The author has explained their discomfort, shown a study about misophonia related to ASMR, and the boyfriend responds by putting in earphones. The author is asking if they're being unreasonable.\n\nThe main points here are about shared living space and mutual accommodation. The author has a legitimate need for a specific sleep environment. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds cause distress. The author is communicating their needs, which is important in any relationship. The boyfriend is taking steps to accommodate by using earphones, which shows he's trying to meet the author's needs. \n\nThe key factors are: 1) The author explained their issue, including medical research, which is reasonable. 2) The boyfriend is adjusting his behavior, so there's no indication of refusal. 3) The author is asking for adjustments that are necessary for their well-being. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, partners should respect each other's needs as long as they're communicated clearly. Since the boyfriend is already complying by using earphones, it doesn't seem like the author is being unreasonable. The author isn't asking for a complete sacrifice of the boyfriend's habits but reasonable adjustments. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
