I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep, especially when he listens to ASMR. The author has a specific issue with whispering ASMR, linking it to their misophonia. They showed a study about it, and the boyfriend reacted by putting in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They live together now, so shared living spaces mean they have to negotiate each other's needs. The author needs silence and darkness, which is a common requirement for a good sleep environment. The boyfriend's habits are causing discomfort, so the author is asking for adjustments. That seems reasonable.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to put in earphones after the author shows the study. That suggests he's making an effort to comply, at least on his part. But the author is being persistent, which might be seen as a bit much if the boyfriend is already trying to accommodate. But the author has a valid health-related reason (misophonia), which is a real condition. \n\nMisophonia is recognized as a condition where certain sounds trigger strong negative emotional responses. So, the author isn't just being picky; they have a legitimate medical reason for their discomfort. The boyfriend's ASMR usage is a personal preference, but it's causing harm to the author's well-being. \n\nIn shared living, both parties need to make compromises. The author is asking for things that don't require the boyfriend to stop his activity entirely\u2014just to use headphones or adjust the volume. The boyfriend's immediate reaction to put in earphones after being shown the study indicates he's trying to meet the author's needs. \n\nHowever, the author's constant requests might be wearing on the boyfriend, leading to the question of whether the author is overstepping. But given the health aspect, it's more about the boyfriend needing to adjust his habits to accommodate the author's needs, which is a common expectation in relationships. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They have a valid reason and are making reasonable requests that the boyfriend is partially complying with. The boyfriend's guilt about his \"pleasure\" might indicate he feels conflicted, but the author's health and sleep are more critical. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
