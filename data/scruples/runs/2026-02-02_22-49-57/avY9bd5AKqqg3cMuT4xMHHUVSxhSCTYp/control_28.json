I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits. The author explains they need silence and darkness to sleep, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR or YouTube, which they find uncomfortable. They mention misophonia, specifically triggered by whispering ASMR.\n\nFirst, the author is in a shared living space, which introduces the need for mutual compromise. They have communicated their needs clearly, showing they've tried to address the issue without being confrontational. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014rolling away and using earphones\u2014suggests he respects their boundaries, at least initially. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author isn't making unreasonable demands; they're setting boundaries for their health and well-being. Misophonia is a real condition that can cause significant distress, so it's valid for the author to address triggers. The boyfriend's behavior isn't inherently wrong, but he should accommodate his partner's needs in a shared space. \n\nSince the author is advocating for their own comfort in a situation where cohabitation requires compromise, and they're not being hostile but rather setting clear boundaries based on legitimate health reasons, it's reasonable to conclude they're not the asshole. The boyfriend's immediate compliance also shows he's willing to adjust, which supports the idea that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
