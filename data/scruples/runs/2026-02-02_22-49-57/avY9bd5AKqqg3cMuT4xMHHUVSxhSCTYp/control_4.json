I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend and girlfriend who moved in together. The girlfriend is asking her boyfriend to lower his laptop's volume and brightness because she's trying to sleep. She also tells him how ASMR makes her feel anxious and trapped. He's into ASMR, especially whispering types, which she has misophonia towards.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly trying to communicate her needs, which are valid because she's dealing with discomfort and misophonia. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds cause distress, so that's a legitimate reason for her to be upset. She's asking for adjustments, which is reasonable when living with someone.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel his needs are being ignored. He has a bedtime routine that's important to him. But since they live together, both have to make some compromises. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is necessary for cohabitation. She's also given him options (earphones, turning down brightness) that don't completely take away his ability to enjoy his ASMR, just modify it to avoid affecting her.\n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. The author is communicating her needs and suggesting solutions. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) shows he's making an effort after being told. The author isn't banning him from doing ASMR entirely, just adjusting when she's nearby. \n\nThere's no indication she's being unreasonable or that her requests are excessive. She's given examples of how she's tried to accommodate his routine while meeting her own needs. Since she's not asking for a complete stop but adjustments, it's a balanced approach. The boyfriend's guilt about his pleasure isn't the author's responsibility; her right to a good night's sleep is important too.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's asserting her needs respectfully and seeking solutions that consider both parties' well-being.\n"
