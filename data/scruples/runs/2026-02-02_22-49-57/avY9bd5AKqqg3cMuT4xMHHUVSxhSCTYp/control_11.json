I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend and girlfriend moving in together, and the girlfriend is asking him to turn down his laptop's sound and brightness because his bedtime routine is disrupting her sleep. She mentions she has misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR, which makes her anxious and uncomfortable. She showed him a study about it, and he responded by using earphones. Now, she's wondering if she's the asshole for asking him to adjust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Moving in together means adjusting to each other's habits. The author is setting boundaries for her own well-being. Misophonia is a real condition, and her reaction to whispering ASMR is a legitimate health issue. She's communicated her needs clearly and provided evidence (the study) to explain her discomfort. The boyfriend's response was to use earphones, which seems like a reasonable compromise. \n\nOn the other hand, he might feel that his own needs for relaxation (like ASMR) are being restricted. However, since they live together, mutual adjustments are necessary. The author isn't asking him to stop entirely, just to adjust when she's trying to sleep. That seems fair. There's no indication she's being unreasonable or that he's being harmed. The fact that he complied after understanding her issue suggests that her approach was valid.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's advocating for her health and well-being in a shared living space. Answer B.\n"
