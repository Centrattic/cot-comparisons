I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that the author and their boyfriend just moved in together. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep, while the boyfriend's bedtime involves using his laptop, watching YouTube, or listening to ASMR, which he really likes. The author asks him to turn down the sound and brightness every night, which seems to bother the boyfriend. The author also mentions that they have misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR, and showed a study to the boyfriend. The boyfriend responded by rolling away and using earphones.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author has legitimate needs for a good night's sleep. Sleep is important, and if the boyfriend's activities are disrupting that, the author has a right to ask for changes. Misophonia is a real condition, and the author's discomfort when hearing whispers or certain sounds is valid. They even provided a study, which the boyfriend took action on by using earphones. That seems like he's trying to accommodate.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own habits and preferences. Moving in together often requires compromise. The author is making repeated requests, which might be seen as nagging, but given the health implications (sleep and misophonia), it's more about necessary adjustments. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014using earphones\u2014suggests he's making an effort, which is good, but maybe the author is still not satisfied.\n\nI need to check if the author is being unreasonable. Are their requests excessive? The author is asking for things like turning down brightness and sound, which are reasonable in a shared space. The boyfriend's use of earphones is a good solution for sound, but brightness might still be an issue. The author's mental health and comfort are important factors here.\n\nThe key points are: the author's needs are health-related (sleep and misophonia), they've communicated this to the boyfriend, and he's made some adjustments. The boyfriend's habits are a personal preference but need to be adjusted for the shared living environment. Since the boyfriend is making some changes (earphones), but maybe not enough on brightness, the author's continued requests are justified to maintain their well-being.\n\nSo, the author isn't the asshole here. They're advocating for their needs in a way that's respectful and based on legitimate health concerns. The boyfriend should be willing to make further adjustments if necessary. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
