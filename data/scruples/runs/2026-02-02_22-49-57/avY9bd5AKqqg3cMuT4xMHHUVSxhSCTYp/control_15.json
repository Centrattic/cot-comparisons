I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is moving in with their boyfriend. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using his laptop\u2014watching YouTube, ASMR, etc. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep. They ask him to lower the volume, dim the brightness, and other things. The boyfriend doesn't seem happy about these requests. The author also mentions that they have misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR, which causes anxiety. They showed a research study to the boyfriend, who then used earphones.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: The author is communicating their needs, which is reasonable. They have a medical condition (misophonia), which adds weight to their requests. They tried to explain their situation and provided evidence. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away, using earphones) suggests he's making an effort once he understands the issue. \n\nBut are the author's requests too much? Well, when people live together, they have to adjust to each other's needs. The author is asking for adjustments that help them sleep better. Since the boyfriend is using his own device and the author is sharing the room, it's about mutual adjustments. The author isn't forbidding him from doing these activities entirely but is asking for modifications that minimize disturbance. \n\nThe boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, so maybe he's resistant. But the author's health and well-being are also important. They've tried to explain their condition, which is a valid reason. The boyfriend's immediate compliance after being shown the research indicates he respects the author's needs once he understands the issue. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author is being too controlling, but given the health aspect and the mutual adjustments in a shared living space, it's reasonable. They are not being unreasonable; they are setting boundaries for their well-being. The boyfriend's response shows he can accommodate, so the author isn't in the wrong here. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are justified. They're advocating for their health needs, and the boyfriend's adjustment (using earphones) is a reasonable compromise. So the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
