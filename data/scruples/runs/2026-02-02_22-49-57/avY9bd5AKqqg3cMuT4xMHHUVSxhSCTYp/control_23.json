I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's boyfriend using his laptop with sound and brightness on at night, which disturbs the author's sleep. The author mentions having misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR, and has shown a study to the boyfriend. They've been moving in together, so this is a new living arrangement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is asking the boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness, which is reasonable because they need silence and darkness for sleep. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using the laptop, which is conflicting with the author's needs. The author has communicated their discomfort, even explaining their misophonia with a study. The boyfriend's reaction is to put in earphones, which suggests he respects her feelings but might be frustrated.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they are asking for reasonable accommodations in their shared living space. It's normal for people to have different needs, especially in a relationship. The author isn't being overly demanding; they're setting boundaries to ensure their own well-being. The boyfriend's use of earphones is a compromise, so the author isn't preventing him from doing his routine entirely, just adjusting it to be less intrusive. The fact that they've been living together for a short time and are navigating these issues is part of any relationship's adjustment period. The author isn't being unreasonable here; they're advocating for their health and comfort. Therefore, the answer should be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
