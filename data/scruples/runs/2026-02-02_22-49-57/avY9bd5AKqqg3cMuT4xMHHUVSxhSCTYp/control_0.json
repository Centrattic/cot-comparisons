I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness so they can sleep. The boyfriend's preference is to watch YouTube or listen to ASMR, especially whispering ASMR, which the author has misophonia and finds really uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is moving in together, which means they're sharing a living space. They have different bedtime routines: the author needs silence and darkness, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with sound and light. The author has asked him multiple times to adjust, which is reasonable for a shared space. The boyfriend's reaction is to roll over or use earphones, which seems like he's trying to comply. However, the author mentions that the boyfriend doesn't seem happy about it, but the author is justified because their health is affected by the ASMR content.\n\nMisophonia is a real condition where certain sounds cause distress. The author has even shown a study about it, which adds credibility to their request. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, but adjusting for a partner's well-being is part of a healthy relationship. The author isn't being unreasonable by asking for accommodations, especially since they're in a shared space. The boyfriend's compliance, albeit with some reluctance, shows he respects the author's needs. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They have a legitimate health concern and are communicating their needs in a shared living situation. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
