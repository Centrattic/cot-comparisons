I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits to accommodate their sensitivity to ASMR and laptop noise.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they have misophonia, which is a condition where certain sounds cause strong negative reactions. They show the boyfriend a study, which he responds to by using earphones. That suggests he's aware of their sensitivity and is making an effort. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's bedtime routine includes using his laptop with sound and brightness. The author asks him to turn these down each night, which he doesn't seem to like. The key here is whether the author's requests are reasonable. Since the author's health and comfort are at stake due to a medical condition, their needs are valid. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones indicates he's complying when asked about ASMR. But the ongoing need to adjust the laptop's volume and brightness every night might indicate that the boyfriend isn't fully accommodating without being reminded. \n\nIn a shared living space, both partners need to make compromises. The author is asking for adjustments that directly affect their well-being, which is a legitimate concern. The boyfriend's resistance or reluctance to consistently comply without being asked each time could be an issue. \n\nThe study the author shared shows they're proactive in addressing the problem. However, the boyfriend's \"guilty pleasure\" in ASMR might be causing friction if he's not willing to consistently make changes. \n\nOverall, the author's actions are about maintaining their health and comfort, which is not in the wrong. The boyfriend might need to be more considerate without being prompted every night. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
