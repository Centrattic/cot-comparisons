I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR habits to accommodate their need for silence and darkness at night.\n\nFirst, cohabitation often involves compromise. Both partners have their own routines and preferences. The author needs silence and darkness, which is completely valid. They've tried to communicate their needs, which is the right step. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has his own bedtime routine involving YouTube or ASMR, which he enjoys. But his habits are affecting the author's sleep and causing them anxiety, especially with ASMR's whispering.\n\nThe author isn't just making a one-time request; they mention it happens every night. They've tried various solutions like asking to turn down the volume and brightness. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014rolling away and putting in earphones\u2014suggests he respects her boundaries. The author also provided research to explain their discomfort, showing they're trying to be understanding and communicative.\n\nMisophonia is a real condition, and the author's reaction to whispering ASMR is part of that. It's not just about personal preference here; it's a medical issue. The boyfriend's immediate action after being shown the study indicates he's trying to accommodate.\n\nSo, the author is advocating for their health and well-being, which is necessary. They're not being unreasonable by setting boundaries in their shared living space. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure doesn't override the author's need for a restful sleep. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
