I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use when they're trying to sleep, especially regarding ASMR and misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their boyfriend just moved in together. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR in the evenings. The author has to ask him to lower the volume, adjust brightness, etc. The boyfriend doesn't like it when the author asks. Additionally, the author has misophonia triggered by whispering ASMR, which the boyfriend starts to use. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and accommodation in a shared living space. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which are valid health concerns. Misophonia is a real condition, and ASMR can cause discomfort. The boyfriend's habits are affecting the author's well-being. The author is asking for adjustments that are reasonable, like lower volume and brightness. They even showed research about their condition, which shows they're trying to explain it clearly. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is also in his own rights to his bedtime routine. But moving in together usually requires some compromise. The author's requests don't seem excessive\u2014they're about shared space and health. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away, using earphones) might indicate he's trying to comply, but maybe there's more to do. \n\nIs the author at fault? They're advocating for their needs, which is reasonable. Unless they're being overly demanding without considering the other's side, but the scenario shows they're trying to find a middle ground. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, but it's affecting the author. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They're communicating their needs and making reasonable adjustments. The boyfriend should also consider their partner's health issues. So the answer is B, No.\n"
