I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again. The author is moving in with their boyfriend and they have different bedtime routines. The boyfriend uses his laptop for YouTube or ASMR, which he really likes, especially the whispering or vocal ASMR. The author, however, needs silence and darkness to sleep and has issues with the laptop's sound and brightness. They ask him to turn it down, lower brightness, etc., which the boyfriend doesn't like. The author also explained they have misophonia when it comes to whispering, showed him a study, and he put in earphones. The question is whether the author is the asshole for setting these boundaries.\n\nFirst, moving in together means adjusting to each other's habits. The author has a legitimate need for a quiet and dark room to sleep, which is common. The boyfriend's use of laptop (sound and brightness) is interfering with that. The author is asking for reasonable accommodations. But the boyfriend is using the laptop as part of his routine, maybe even a coping mechanism if ASMR helps him relax. \n\nThe author's reaction to whispering ASMR is due to misophonia, a real condition. They provided evidence through a study, which the boyfriend heeded by using earphones. That shows the author is being considerate and trying to find a solution that works for both. The boyfriend's guilt about his pleasure suggests he values the author's comfort, but maybe he's upset because he feels his preferences are being limited. However, the author's needs are about their health and well-being, which should take priority. \n\nIs asking for sound and brightness adjustments too much? If they're sharing a room, it's reasonable. The author isn't banning ASMR entirely, just when they need to sleep. The boyfriend could use earphones or a sleep mask and maybe white noise for himself. The author is communicating their needs, which is important in any relationship. It's not about being controlling but about mutual respect. The boyfriend's guilt might indicate he's being inconsiderate by not adapting early on. \n\nSo the author is not in the wrong. They're advocating for their needs, which are valid. The boyfriend should be more accommodating, especially after being informed about misophonia. Answer B.\n"
