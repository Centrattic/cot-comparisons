I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits. The situation involves moving in together, different routines, and specific sensitivities.\n\nFirst, the author needs silence and darkness at night, which is a common requirement for good sleep. The boyfriend uses a laptop with sound and brightness, which the author finds disturbing. The author asks him to lower the volume and brightness, which seems reasonable. People often have different preferences when sharing a space, so communication is key here.\n\nThen there's the issue with ASMR, specifically whispering. The author mentions having misophonia, a real condition where certain sounds cause distress. They did research and showed a study to their partner. The boyfriend's reaction is to roll away and use earphones. This shows he's trying to accommodate. \n\nBut the author is being critical of themselves for repeatedly asking for adjustments. The key points are: 1) The author's needs are valid and health-related (sleep and misophonia). 2) The boyfriend is making an effort to comply. 3) They communicated their feelings and provided evidence to help him understand. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Since the author is advocating for their needs in a shared living situation, and the boyfriend is adjusting, it's more about mutual compromise. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're addressing legitimate issues. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
