I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's volume and brightness when they're trying to sleep, especially when he listens to ASMR. The author mentions they have misophonia triggered by whispering, which causes anxiety and discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend is in a new living situation, and the author is setting boundaries for their own comfort. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves activities that the author finds disruptive. The author isn't just being petty; they have a legitimate medical condition, misophonia, which affects their well-being. They tried to communicate this and even provided a study, so he understands it's not just personal preference.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel his needs aren't being respected. Maybe he's adjusting by using earphones now, but the author still has to ask repeatedly. However, the author is asking for reasonable adjustments\u2014lowering volume, dimming brightness, using earphones. These aren't extreme demands. They're trying to coexist in a shared space, which is a normal part of any relationship.\n\nThe key points are that the author has a valid reason, they're communicating their needs, and the requests are reasonable. The boyfriend is making some changes, but it's possible he's not fully compliant yet. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're prioritizing their health. So, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. They're advocating for their own well-being in a shared living situation.\n"
