He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for being upset with his girlfriend's treatment of his dog. Let me read through the scenario again to get all the details.\n\nThe author, who's 21, has a St Bernard named Moose. They've been living together since the dog was 3 months old, and the dog is very well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, has been coming over a lot since they've been together for four months. The author mentions Moose is protective around her, sitting next to him on the sofa. Then Julia starts treating the dog poorly in several ways: shouting, smacking him, not giving treats, ignoring him, changing his sleeping arrangements, etc. The author is upset because he sees this as Julia being mean to his pet and is considering ending the relationship or addressing it more directly.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about responsibility for the dog, the girlfriend's actions, and the author's response. \n\nThe author is the dog's owner, so he has the right to set boundaries about how others treat his pet. Julia's actions\u2014shouting, smacking the dog, not following his rules\u2014are problematic. Slapping the dog for bad behavior is definitely not acceptable, and the author is right to be against that. Also, Julia's jealousy and not giving treats when asked are issues. The author has already tried to compromise (like leaving the door open) but Julia isn't respecting those agreements. \n\nHowever, the author might need to consider if he's being too strict. For example, Julia might feel that the dog is getting too much attention, but that's not a valid reason to treat him poorly. The author's stance seems justified because he's the one responsible for the dog's well-being. The girlfriend's actions are crossing into abusive territory, especially the smacking. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The author is not in the wrong here because he's protecting his pet from mistreatment. The girlfriend isn't living there, so she should respect his house rules. The author is within his rights to be upset and to set boundaries. So the answer should be B.\n"
