He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Reddit-style post) is in the wrong for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog. \n\nFirst, the author has a very close bond with his dog, Moose. He got Moose as a puppy and has been caring for him alone since. Moose is well-behaved, which the author is proud of. Now, with his girlfriend (Julia) coming over more often, there are issues arising in how she interacts with Moose.\n\nThe key points from the list the author provided are that Julia shouts at Moose, wants him off the sofa, doesn't give treats, smacks him, and is generally unkind. The author has tried to find compromises, like leaving the door open so Moose can come back to the room. However, Julia's behavior continues, leading the author to question if he's in the wrong for being upset.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's reaction is justified. The author is the owner of Moose, so he has the right to set boundaries on how his pet is treated. Julia's actions\u2014shouting, physical punishment, withholding treats, and trying to change Moose's living conditions\u2014could be stressful for the dog. The author is concerned about Moose's well-being and the impact of Julia's behavior on their relationship.\n\nJulia's jealousy of the affection given to Moose might also be a factor. However, the primary issue is her treatment of the dog. The author's main grievance is her negative interactions with Moose, which he finds unacceptable. He has communicated his concerns and tried to make compromises, but Julia isn't respecting those boundaries.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author is defending his dog from what he perceives as mistreatment. Since Moose is his responsibility, he has the right to be protective. Julia, as a guest in his home, should respect his rules regarding his pet. Her actions might be causing unnecessary stress to Moose, which the author is rightly concerned about.\n\nTherefore, the author's position seems justified. He's standing up for his dog's well-being and the bond they share. The answer would be that he's not in the wrong.\n"
