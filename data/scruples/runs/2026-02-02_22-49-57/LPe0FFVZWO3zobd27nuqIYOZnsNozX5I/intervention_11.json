He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation with his girlfriend and the dog. The author is upset because his girlfriend treats his dog poorly. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author, 21M, has a St Bernard named Moose he's had for three months. They're very close, and Moose is well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, is 23F, and they've been together four months. She lives with her parents, so they spend time at the author's place. Moose is protective of the author around her. When Julia comes over, Moose sits by him. When she sleeps over, Moose sleeps in the bedroom, but Julia yelled at him to get out, which the author found upsetting. They compromised by leaving the door open. But then Julia continued being mean to Moose.\n\nThe author lists several issues: not giving treats, ignoring him, wanting him in the kitchen (too cold), smacking him twice, being jealous, calling him annoying despite her own three dogs, screaming at him for barking, and feeding him less. The author has told Julia to ignore the dog if she's going to be mean, but she doesn't listen.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. Let's evaluate.\n\nFirst, the author is the dog's owner and has established a routine. Moose is his responsibility. The girlfriend is a new person in the home, and her actions are affecting the dog's well-being. The author is concerned about Julia's handling of Moose, especially physical punishment (smacking) which is generally discouraged in modern dog training. The author has tried to compromise but Julia isn't respecting his boundaries or the dog's needs.\n\nJulia's actions include yelling, physical discipline, and not following the agreed-upon arrangements. The author's main issues are with her treatment of Moose, which could be harmful and possibly indicate a lack of respect for the author's decisions as the owner.\n\nIs there any point where the author might be in the wrong? Maybe if he didn't communicate his boundaries clearly or if Moose's behavior was problematic. But according to the scenario, Moose is well-behaved. The author has discussed things with Julia but she's not complied. The author is justified in feeling that Julia's actions are harmful and that he needs to address them, possibly by ending the relationship if she can't respect his dog.\n\nSo, based on the information, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
