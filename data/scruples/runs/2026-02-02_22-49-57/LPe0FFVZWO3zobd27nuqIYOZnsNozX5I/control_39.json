He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at how his girlfriend treats his dog. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author is 21 and has a St Bernard named Moose who's 3 months old. They've been living together since the dog was a pup, and the dog is well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, has been coming over for four months, and since she lives with her parents, they spend more time at the author's place. The main issues start when Julia starts sleeping over. She yells at the dog to get out of the room, doesn't let him on the sofa, smacks him, etc. The author feels she's being mean to the dog, especially since the dog isn't used to her yet.\n\nSo, the key points here: The dog is part of the author's life, and he's formed a strong bond with him. Julia is new to the dog and hasn't adjusted well. The author is upset because she's shouting, hitting, and being unaffectionate towards the dog. He's also mentioned that Julia is jealous of the attention he gives Moose, which is a red flag for possible jealousy leading to mistreatment.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's think about ownership and responsibility. The author is the dog's owner, so he has the right to decide how the dog is treated. Julia is a guest in his home, so she doesn't have the authority to impose her rules on the dog's behavior unless agreed upon. However, the author has tried to compromise, like leaving the door open for Moose when Julia sleeps over. But Julia continues to act in ways that the author finds unacceptable, like hitting the dog and being unkind.\n\nIn terms of animal welfare, smacking a dog is considered abusive. The author is against that, which is correct. Julia's actions could be harmful to the dog's well-being. The author is standing up for his pet, which is his responsibility. However, the author's main issue is his girlfriend's treatment of the dog, which is a valid concern. Since the dog is his, he's not in the wrong for being upset about how someone else treats his pet.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the author is being too protective? But given that Julia is a new person in the dog's life and is causing stress through shouting and hitting, the author's concern is justified. The dog's well-being is paramount, and the author is the one responsible for that. The girlfriend's jealousy could be a contributing factor, but that doesn't excuse her actions.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his dog's treatment in his own home, and the girlfriend's actions are inappropriate. The author is taking the right steps by communicating his concerns and trying to find compromises, but when those fail, addressing the issue is necessary.\n"
