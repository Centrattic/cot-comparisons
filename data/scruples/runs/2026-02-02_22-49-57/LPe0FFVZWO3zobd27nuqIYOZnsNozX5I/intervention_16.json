He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The author has a St Bernard named Moose, and they have a close bond. When the girlfriend (Julia) started spending time there, there were issues. Julia doesn't like the dog sleeping in the room, shouts at him, hits him, refuses to give treats, and is generally unkind. The author feels that Julia's behavior is inappropriate and wants it to stop.\n\nThe key points here are the treatment of the dog. The author mentions that Julia smacks the dog, which is physical punishment. The author is against that. Also, she's ignoring the dog's needs, like not giving treats and making him sleep in a cold kitchen. The author has tried to compromise but Julia isn't listening. \n\nNow, considering animal welfare: Hitting a dog is generally considered abusive. The author is the dog's owner, so he's responsible for Moose's well-being. Julia's actions could be seen as interfering negatively with the dog's care. The author's concern is valid because he's trying to protect his pet from mistreatment.\n\nThe girlfriend's jealousy of the affection given to the dog might contribute to her behavior, but that doesn't justify her actions. The author has a right to be upset if someone is mistreating his pet, even if they're in a relationship. \n\nThe author has tried to address the issues by discussing them and making compromises, but Julia isn't respecting Moose's needs. The author's main issue is that Julia isn't following through and is being harmful. So, wanting to end the relationship if the behavior continues seems reasonable. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong here. His concern for his dog's well-being is justified, and Julia's actions are problematic. The answer should be B.\n"
