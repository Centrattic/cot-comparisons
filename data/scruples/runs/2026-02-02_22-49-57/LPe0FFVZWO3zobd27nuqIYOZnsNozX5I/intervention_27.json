He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation with his girlfriend and their dog. The story is about the author's dog, Moose, and how the girlfriend treats him. The author is upset because the girlfriend yells at the dog, won't give treats, hits him, and is generally mean. The girlfriend is jealous of the attention the dog gets.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. The author is the dog's owner. He's had the dog since he was a puppy and they have a close bond. The girlfriend started coming over, and he's noticed she's been unkind to the dog. The author has tried to compromise, like leaving the door open for the dog to come in at night, but the issues continue. The girlfriend hits the dog, which is a big no-no. The author is firm about not using physical punishment. \n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset and possibly setting boundaries. From the information given, the girlfriend's actions seem inappropriate. Hitting the dog is a serious issue. Also, yelling, not giving treats, and trying to change the dog's established routine without proper training could be harmful. The author is standing up for his dog, which he's responsibly owned and cared for. \n\nThe girlfriend's jealousy might be a factor, but that doesn't justify her behavior. The author has a right to be upset if someone is mistreating his pet. Since the dog is his responsibility, he should be the one making decisions about how the dog is treated. The girlfriend's actions, especially the physical punishment, are unacceptable. \n\nThe author has tried to address the issues and compromise, but when the girlfriend doesn't listen and continues to be neglectful or abusive, it's reasonable for him to set boundaries. The key points here are the welfare of the dog and the ownership responsibilities. The author isn't doing anything wrong by protecting his pet. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. He's standing up for his dog against mistreatment, which is justified. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue here, not the author's response.\n"
