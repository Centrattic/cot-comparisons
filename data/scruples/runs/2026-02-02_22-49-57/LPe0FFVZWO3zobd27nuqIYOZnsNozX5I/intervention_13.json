He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being upset with his girlfriend's treatment of his dog, Moose. The author lists several issues: the girlfriend shouting at the dog, not giving treats, smacking the dog, and other behaviors that the author considers harmful or disrespectful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. He's clearly very attached to his dog, which is understandable. The dog is his responsibility, and he's had him since he was a puppy. The girlfriend is visiting his place, so she's a guest, right? But she's making decisions about the dog's treatment that he disagrees with. The author is trying to communicate his boundaries, but she's not respecting them. That's a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her needs and comfort are also important. She's living with her parents, so maybe she's not used to having a dog in the house, or maybe she has different standards. However, the actions she's taking\u2014like smacking the dog, shouting, refusing to give treats\u2014those are things that the author has explicitly said are against his wishes. The author is the one who owns the dog and is responsible for his care, so the girlfriend shouldn't be making those decisions without his consent.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and respect for boundaries. The author has made it clear that he doesn't want the dog to be hit, not given treats when asked, or kept in the kitchen. The girlfriend is ignoring those boundaries, which is a red flag in a relationship. It's not right for a partner to disregard the other person's clear instructions, especially when it comes to something as sensitive as how their pet is treated.\n\nAlso, emotional abuse towards the dog is a concern. Smacking the dog, even if it's not physical harm, can cause fear and stress in the animal. The author is taking responsibility for his dog's well-being, which is his role as the owner. The girlfriend's actions are interfering with that, which is a problem. The author is justified in being upset and wanting to address this with her.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. The girlfriend is overstepping her bounds by treating the dog in ways the author has forbidden. The author's actions to address this are appropriate because he's protecting his pet and his own values. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
