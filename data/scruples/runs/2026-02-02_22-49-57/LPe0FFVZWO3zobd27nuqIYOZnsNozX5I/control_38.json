He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at how his girlfriend treats his dog.\n\nFirst, the author has a close relationship with his dog, Moose, who's been living with him and is well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, has started coming over more, and there are several issues. She yells at the dog, wants him excluded from the bedroom, refuses to give treats, ignores him, and even smacked him. The author is upset about her treatment of Moose.\n\nNow, the key points here are the actions Julia took. The author mentions that she shouted at Moose, which is a form of negative reinforcement and can be stressful for a dog. She also physically hit him, which is abusive. Dogs rely on positive reinforcement, so smacking can lead to fear and anxiety, which the author noticed in Moose (feeling guilty). That's a red flag. Julia also ignores the dog when he seeks affection, which could be neglect. Plus, she's making Moose sleep in a cold kitchen, which is against the author's wishes and potentially harmful. \n\nThe author has tried to compromise, like leaving the door open, but Julia continues her behavior. The author's main issue is that Julia is being cruel to his pet, which is a significant part of his life. The author is standing up for his dog's well-being, which is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, Julia might feel that she's trying to protect the author from the dog or that the dog is getting too much attention. However, her methods (yelling, hitting) are inappropriate and harmful. The author has a right to be upset, especially since he's the owner and responsible for Moose's care. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. The actions Julia is taking are harmful, and it's valid for him to address this. The answer should be B (No).\n"
