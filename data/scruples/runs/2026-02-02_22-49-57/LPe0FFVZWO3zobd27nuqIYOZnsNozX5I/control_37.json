He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend and their dog. The author, a guy named 21m, has a St Bernard named Moose. He's been living with Moose since he got him, and they have a really good relationship. The girlfriend, Julia, is 23f, and they've been together four months. She lives with her parents, so they spend time at his place. \n\nThe main issue seems to be how Julia treats Moose. The author is upset because Julia has been shouting at the dog, not giving treats, smacking him, wanting him to sleep in the kitchen which is too cold, and showing jealousy towards the dog. The author has tried to compromise but feels Julia's actions are harmful and unnecessary. He's asking if he's in the wrong for being mad about this.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the key points. The author is the dog's owner, right? He's responsible for Moose's care. Julia is a new person in Moose's life, and the dog is showing protective behavior, which is normal. But Julia is reacting negatively, which could be stressing the dog. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being and is defending his bond with Moose. \n\nJulia's actions: shouting, smacking, not giving treats, moving the dog's sleeping area to a cold kitchen, ignoring the dog, and expressing jealousy. The author mentions that the dog is well-behaved and that he's had Moose for a while. He's trying to mediate, like leaving the door open so Moose can come back. But Julia isn't respecting his boundaries. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's the owner, so he has the right to decide how his pet is treated. Julia isn't a co-owner, so she shouldn't be making decisions about the dog's care without his consent. The author is trying to communicate and set boundaries, which is reasonable. The fact that Julia is being nasty to the dog and not respecting his wishes is problematic. \n\nThe author's anger is justified because the dog's well-being is at stake. The dog is his responsibility, and Julia's actions could be harmful. The author is trying to maintain a healthy environment for both himself and Moose, and he's communicating his concerns. He's also tried to find compromises, like the open door, but Julia isn't following through. \n\nJulia's jealousy and the way she treats the dog might indicate deeper issues in their relationship. The author is right to address this because it's about the welfare of his pet. The answer here is that the author is not in the wrong. The correct choice is B.\n"
