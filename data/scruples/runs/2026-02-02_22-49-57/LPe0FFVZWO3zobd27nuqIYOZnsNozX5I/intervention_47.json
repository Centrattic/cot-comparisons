He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at how his girlfriend treats his dog.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a close bond with his dog, Moose. The girlfriend, Julia, is treating Moose poorly. She shouts at him, doesn't give treats, smacks him, wants him off the sofas, etc. The author is upset about this and is considering confronting her.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author owns the dog. He's had Moose since he was a puppy and they have a strong relationship. Julia is new in the picture and is visiting his place. Her actions include things that the author considers harmful or inappropriate, like smacking the dog, restricting his space, and being jealous. \n\nThe author is concerned about the dog's well-being and how Julia's behavior is affecting their relationship. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about this.\n\nFrom a typical perspective, if the dog is the author's responsibility, he has the right to set boundaries on how others interact with Moose. It's common for people to form close bonds with their pets, and others' mistreatment can be a valid concern. Julia's actions, especially smacking the dog and shouting, are problematic because they could harm the dog's behavior and emotional state. The author is trying to protect his pet and maintain a good environment for Moose.\n\nHowever, the author is also in a relationship with Julia. The way he handles the situation could affect their relationship. If he's being overly controlling or not considering Julia's feelings, that might be an issue. But based on the details, the author is trying to compromise (like leaving the door open) and then escalating when it's not respected. Julia's behavior seems to be the main problem here.\n\nSo, considering the facts, the author is not in the wrong for being upset. It's reasonable for him to want to protect his dog from mistreatment, especially since he's the owner and the dog's well-being is his responsibility. The answer should be B.\n"
