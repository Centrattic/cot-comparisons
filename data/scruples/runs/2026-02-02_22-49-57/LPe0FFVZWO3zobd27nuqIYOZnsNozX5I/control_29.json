He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author is 21, has a St Bernard named Moose, and they live together. Moose is described as well-behaved, which the author is proud of. The girlfriend, Julia, is 23 and still lives with her parents, so they spend most time at his place. The issue is how Julia treats Moose.\n\nInitially, Moose was protective of the author when Julia came over, which makes sense since he's his best friend. When Julia started sleeping over, she told Moose to get out of the room, shouting. The author tried to compromise by leaving the door open. But then Julia continued to be harsh: not giving treats, smacking Moose, making him sleep in the cold kitchen, screaming at him for barking, etc. The author is upset because Moose is his pet and he's used to a good routine. He's trying to protect his dog from stress and negative behavior.\n\nNow, the author is considering telling her to stop, but she's not listening. The user wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points: The author is defending his dog's treatment. Julia is being harsh and not respecting the dog's established routine. The author has tried to compromise but Julia isn't cooperating. Smacking the dog is a red flag because the author is against physical punishment. Also, Julia is making decisions about the dog's living conditions without considering his needs (like the cold kitchen).\n\nFrom an animal welfare perspective, smacking the dog is problematic. Also, Julia's actions are causing the dog stress, which the author is trying to prevent. The author is standing up for his pet, which is his responsibility as the owner. The fact that Julia is not living there but still imposing her will might be an issue. Owners have the right to decide how their pets are treated, especially in their own home.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground. But given the smacking and ignoring the dog's needs, the author's anger is justified. So the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
