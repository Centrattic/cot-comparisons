He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author, a 21-year-old guy, is close to his St Bernard, Moose, who he's had since the dog was three months old. Moose is well-behaved and they live together. The author is in a four-month relationship with his girlfriend, Julia, who is 23 and still lives with her parents. They spend a lot of time at his place. Initially, Moose was protective of the author when Julia was around, sitting on the opposite side of the sofa. When Julia started sleeping over, she made Moose leave the room, which the author didn't like because Moose was startled. They compromised by leaving the door open. \n\nThen Julia started acting badly towards Moose in several ways: not giving treats, ignoring him, wanting him to sleep in the cold kitchen, smacking him, expressing jealousy, calling him annoying, screaming at him for barking, and feeding him less. The author has tried to explain his stance on Moose and has told Julia to ignore him if she's going to be mean, but she doesn't listen. Now the author is considering ending things if this continues and wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, what's the key here?\n\nFirst, the author has a strong bond with his dog, which is understandable since he's raised Moose alone. Moose is part of his life, and he's responsible for the dog's care. When Julia came into the picture, her treatment of Moose started causing conflict. The author is concerned about Moose's well-being and how Julia's actions might affect him. \n\nJulia's actions include physical punishment (smacking), not following the agreed compromise (sleeping in the kitchen when the author said it's too cold), and emotional neglect (ignoring him, jealousy, screaming). These are significant issues because they can negatively impact the dog's behavior and stress levels. Dogs can sense tension and mistreatment, which can lead to behavioral problems.\n\nThe author has tried to communicate and compromise, but Julia continues her behavior. This suggests that Julia isn't respecting the author's boundaries regarding his pet. The author's reaction is to be upset and consider ending the relationship if the treatment continues. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, mutual respect is crucial. If Julia can't respect the author's feelings towards his dog and the dog's needs, that's a red flag. However, the author's approach to handling the situation is to set clear boundaries. He's not being aggressive but is standing up for his pet's well-being. \n\nJulia's justification for her actions (like not giving treats to prevent weight gain) might be well-intentioned, but the method (smacking, screaming) is harmful. The author's concern is valid because the dog's emotional and physical health is at stake. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe Julia feels insecure or jealous because the dog gets a lot of attention. However, that's not an excuse for mistreating an animal. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is advocating for his pet's welfare, which is a responsible stance. Julia's actions are problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset and setting boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
