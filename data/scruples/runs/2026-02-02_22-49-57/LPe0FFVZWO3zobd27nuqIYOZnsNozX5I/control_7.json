He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author, a guy in his early 20s, has a St Bernard named Moose. They've been living together since Moose was a puppy, and the dog is really well-behaved. He's been with his girlfriend for four months, and she lives with her parents, so they spend a lot of time at his place. The main issue is how the girlfriend, Julia, treats the dog.\n\nThe author mentions that Moose starts to act protective when Julia is around, sitting next to him on the sofa. But when Julia starts sleeping over, she yells at Moose to get out of the room and wants him to sleep in the kitchen, even though he says it's too cold there. There's a compromise made where the door is left open so Moose can come back in after they sleep. However, problems continue. Julia refuses to give Moose treats, ignores him when he tries to interact, has smacked him twice, and is jealous of the affection the author gives to Moose. Other points include her saying Moose is annoying despite her family having big dogs, screaming at him for barking, and feeding him less.\n\nThe author is upset about how Julia treats his dog and is considering telling her to stop. He's already told her to ignore the dog if she's going to be mean, but she doesn't listen.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong (answer A) or not (answer B). Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is the owner of the dog, so he has the right to decide how the dog is treated in his home. Julia is visiting and should respect his rules regarding his pet. However, when someone is in your home, especially a partner, there's an expectation of mutual respect. The key issue here is whether the author's actions are justified in defending his dog's treatment.\n\nJulia's actions: shouting at the dog, smacking him, refusing to interact with him, feeding him less, ignoring the dog's needs (like keeping him in a cold kitchen), and showing jealousy. These are all negative actions towards the dog. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being and the fact that Julia is not respecting the dog's established routines and care.\n\nThe author has tried to compromise, like allowing the door to be open. But Julia continues to act in ways that the author finds harmful. The author is now considering ending the relationship if Julia doesn't stop, which is his right. The question is whether the author is wrong for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog.\n\nFrom an animal welfare perspective, Julia's actions, especially smacking the dog (which the author is against) and yelling, could be considered abusive. Since the dog is the author's, it's reasonable for him to expect that his partner treats the dog kindly. The author is protecting his dog's well-being, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that Julia is just expressing her preferences, but if those preferences involve mistreating someone else's property (the dog), then it's a problem. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for his dog's treatment. The fact that Julia doesn't live there but is making decisions about the dog's care could also be an issue. The author is responsible for the dog's care, so Julia overstepping in that area is problematic.\n\nSo putting this together: the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
