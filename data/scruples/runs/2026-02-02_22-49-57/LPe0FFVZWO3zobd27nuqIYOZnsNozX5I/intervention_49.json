He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author, a 21-year-old guy, has a St Bernard named Moose. They're very close, and Moose is well-behaved. He's been living with the author alone since getting the dog. Then he starts dating a 23-year-old girl, Julia. They spend a lot of time at the author's place. The problem arises because Julia treats Moose poorly. She shouts at him, doesn't let him sleep in the bedroom, won't give treats, uses physical punishment, and other things. The author is upset and wants to know if he's in the wrong for being mad about how Julia treats his dog.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's perspective. Moose is his pet, and he clearly has a strong bond with him. The author is responsible for Moose's care and well-being. Julia's actions, like shouting, physical punishment, and changing the dog's routine without consent, could be harmful. The author tried to compromise but Julia continued her behavior, leading to his frustration.\n\nNow, Julia's side: She might feel that she doesn't live there and isn't used to having a dog. She might not understand the author's attachment. However, her actions\u2014hitting the dog, not following the author's care instructions\u2014could be seen as overstepping. The author has the right to set boundaries for his pet's treatment. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. Julia's actions without the author's approval (like hitting the dog) are problematic. The author is the dog's owner and responsible for his care, so Julia shouldn't make decisions about his treatment. The author's anger is justified because the dog is his, and he's ensuring his well-being.\n\nAlso, physical punishment is generally not recommended for training dogs and can lead to fear or aggression. Smacking the dog could be traumatic, especially since Moose is a calm dog. Julia's jealousy might be a factor, but that doesn't excuse her behavior towards the pet.\n\nThe author tried to address the issue by suggesting a compromise, but Julia didn't follow through. He's now considering confronting her more firmly. Given that the dog is his and Julia's actions are harmful, the author is within his rights to be upset and to set boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's pets is important. If Julia can't respect the author's wishes regarding his dog, it might indicate a bigger issue in their relationship. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for his pet's treatment. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
