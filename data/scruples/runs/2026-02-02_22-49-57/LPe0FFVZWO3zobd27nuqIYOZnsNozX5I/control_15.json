He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the guy has a close relationship with his St Bernard, Moose. He's had the dog since it was three months old, and Moose is well-behaved. The girlfriend (Julia) started visiting, and Moose became protective, sitting by the guy's feet when she's around. The main issues arise when Julia starts sleeping over. She shouts at Moose to get out of the room, which the guy is upset about because of the shouting and the potential distress to the dog. They compromise by leaving the door open. \n\nThen there's a list of other problems: Julia wants Moose off the sofas even though she doesn't live there, she's jealous of the affection the guy gives Moose, refuses to give treats, smacks the dog twice, and more. The guy is concerned about her treatment of the dog and wants to know if he's in the wrong for being mad at her.\n\nSo, the guy's main argument is about the treatment of his pet. He's the owner, and Julia is a guest. The key points here are about respecting the owner's rules regarding their pet. Julia's actions\u2014shouting, smacking, not following the owner's preferences\u2014could be seen as overstepping. The guy has communicated his boundaries, but she's not respecting them.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. From a general perspective, the owner should be the one making decisions about their pet's care. If Julia is causing harm or distress, that's a problem. Smacking the dog is physical punishment, which the guy opposes and which could be harmful. Not giving treats when asked, ignoring the dog, and trying to change established routines without agreement could all be issues. The guy has expressed his concerns and tried to compromise, but she's not listening. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key, but Julia's actions seem to disregard his boundaries. The guy is justified in being upset if she's not respecting his pet's needs and his established care practices. However, the guy should also consider whether he's being overly protective or if there's room for negotiation. But given that the dog is his responsibility and she's a guest, her behavior might be crossing a line. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend is violating the boundaries set by the owner regarding their pet's treatment. The guy is within his rights to be upset if she's harming or mistreating his dog, especially after communication and compromise attempts have failed.\n"
