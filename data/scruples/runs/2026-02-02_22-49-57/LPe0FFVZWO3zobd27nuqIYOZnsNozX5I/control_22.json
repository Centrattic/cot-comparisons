He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about his girlfriend's treatment of his dog, Moose. The user is asking if he's at fault for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author has a close bond with Moose, his St Bernard. He's been living with the dog alone, and Moose is really well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, starts coming over, and there are issues. The main points are:\n\n1. When Julia first came over, Moose tried to be protective, sitting near the author. Julia shouted at the dog to get out of the room when she wanted to sleep. The author was upset because shouting can stress the dog and change his routine. They compromised by leaving the door open.\n\n2. Then, Julia started being \"nasty\" to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, refuses treats, has smacked him twice, ignores him, feeds him less, etc. The author is upset because he doesn't hit the dog, and he thinks Julia's actions are harmful.\n\nThe author lists several grievances. The key here is whether the author is wrong for being upset. The question is whether Julia's actions are justified, and if the author overreacting.\n\nJulia is still living with her parents, so she's a guest. The author's home, and Moose is his dog. So, the author has the right to set boundaries on how his dog is treated. Julia seems to be treating the dog poorly, which the author finds unacceptable.\n\nSmacking the dog is a big issue. Physical punishment can be harmful and is generally not recommended. The author is against it, which is reasonable. Also, not giving treats when asked could be seen as not respecting the owner's wishes. Ignoring the dog when it's seeking affection is another negative action. Feeding him less without the owner's consent is also problematic because the owner knows what's best for the dog.\n\nJulia's jealousy might be a factor, but that's no excuse for mistreating the dog. The author's stance is that the dog is part of his family, and how Julia treats him affects their relationship.\n\nThe author tried to compromise but Julia didn't follow through. He's now considering ending the relationship if Julia doesn't stop. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being upset. Given that Julia's actions are harmful and he's defending his pet, it's more likely he's not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
