He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (AITA) is in the wrong regarding how their girlfriend treats their dog, Moose. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the scenario. The author has a strong bond with Moose, their St Bernard, and Moose is very well-behaved. The girlfriend has been with them for four months, and they spend most time at the author's place. The issues start when the girlfriend wants Moose to sleep in the kitchen, shouts at him, and even smacks him. The author has tried to compromise, like keeping the door open, but the girlfriend continues to be harsh. The author lists several grievances, including not giving treats, ignoring the dog, feeding him less, etc.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is clearly defensive of their dog, which is understandable, especially since Moose is their best friend. The girlfriend's actions\u2014shouting, smacking, not following the author's rules\u2014seem to cross boundaries. The author has communicated their concerns and tried compromises, but the girlfriend hasn't respected those boundaries. \n\nFrom an animal welfare perspective, hitting the dog is a red flag. Even if the girlfriend had a different approach, physical punishment is not acceptable. The author's stance against it is valid. The other issues like not giving treats or feeding less could be minor, but combined with the physical action, it's a significant problem. \n\nThe girlfriend's jealousy might be a factor, but that doesn't justify her mistreatment of the dog. The author's boundaries are reasonable, especially since Moose lives with them and the girlfriend's behavior is affecting the dog's well-being. The author is not the one causing the issues; they've tried to address them. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
