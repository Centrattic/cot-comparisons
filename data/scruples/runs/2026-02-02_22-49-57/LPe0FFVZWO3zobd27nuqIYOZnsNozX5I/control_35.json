He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at how his girlfriend treats his dog. Let me start by summarizing the situation.\n\nThe author is 21, lives with his 3-month-old St Bernard, Moose. They have a good relationship. The girlfriend, Julia, is 23, and they've been dating four months. She lives with her parents, so they spend time at his place. Moose becomes protective of the author when Julia is around, which makes sense for a dog. The main issues start when Julia sleeps over. She yells at Moose to get out of the room, which the author finds upsetting because it could stress the dog. They compromise by leaving the door open. Then Julia starts other behaviors: not giving treats, ignoring Moose, wanting him in the cold kitchen, smacking him, being jealous of the attention Moose gets, calling him annoying despite having three dogs at her parents' house, screaming when he barks, and feeding him less. The author is considering confronting her because she's not listening.\n\nThe key points here are about the treatment of the dog. The author is the dog's owner, and Julia is a guest in his home. The author has set boundaries about how Moose should be treated. Julia is violating those boundaries, which is causing conflict. The author's concern is valid because he's responsible for Moose's well-being. Physical punishment (smacking) is a red flag, as it's generally discouraged in modern dog training. Also, yelling and ignoring the dog can cause stress and anxiety in pets.\n\nJulia's actions might stem from jealousy or discomfort with the dog's presence, but that doesn't justify her treating Moose poorly. The author has a right to expect that his partner respects his pet, especially since the dog is part of his household. The fact that Julia has dogs at her parents' house doesn't excuse her behavior here; each situation is different. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. If Julia is not respecting those boundaries, it's a problem in the relationship.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for being upset. He's standing up for his pet's welfare. The question is whether he's overreacting. Given that physical punishment and yelling are harmful, and Julia is a guest, she shouldn't be imposing her will on his pet. The answer should be B (author not in the wrong). He's justified in wanting her to stop the negative behavior towards his dog.\n"
