He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's girlfriend treating his dog poorly. The author has a close bond with his St Bernard, Moose, and has been living with him since he was a puppy. The girlfriend, Julia, started coming over and they started sleeping over at the author's place. The main issues are that Julia is being harsh towards Moose: shouting, not giving treats, smacking him, and trying to keep him away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is clearly protective of his dog, which is understandable. Moose is well-behaved and the author has taken care of him from a young age. Julia's actions include things like shouting, physical punishment, and jealousy. The author has tried to compromise, like leaving the door open, but Julia isn't respecting the dog's presence or the author's wishes. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being and is frustrated with Julia's behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). The user wants a simple A or B, no explanation. But since I need to think through, let's analyze.\n\nJulia is a girlfriend who visits the author's home. She's not a co-owner of the dog, so her authority over the dog is limited. The author is responsible for Moose's care. If Julia is mistreating the dog, that's a problem. The author has the right to set boundaries for how Moose is treated in his home. The author's anger stems from the fact that Moose is part of his life and Julia's actions are affecting their relationship. He's trying to protect his dog from what he sees as harsh treatment. \n\nJulia's actions like smacking the dog are concerning. Physical punishment can be harmful and is generally discouraged. The author's stance against it is valid. Also, her jealousy and the way she treats Moose (not giving treats, ignoring him, feeding him less) are issues from the author's perspective. The author has tried to address this with compromises, but Julia isn't cooperating. \n\nSince the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would likely be B (No). The author is defending his dog's treatment in his own home. Unless there's a legal or ethical reason to think the author is wrong, but here it's more about personal responsibility and animal welfare. The author is not mistreating Moose; he's trying to prevent his girlfriend from doing so. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
