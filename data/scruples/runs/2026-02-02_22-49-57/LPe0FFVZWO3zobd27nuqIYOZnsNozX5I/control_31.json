He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is about how the girlfriend treats the author's dog. The author and his dog, Moose, have a close relationship. The girlfriend started visiting and has been treating Moose poorly in various ways.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the points the author listed. The girlfriend doesn't give Moose treats when asked, ignores him, wants him to sleep in the kitchen (which is too cold), smacked him twice, is jealous of him, calls him annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents, screams at him when he barks, and feeds him half as much. \n\nThe author has tried to compromise, like leaving the door open so Moose can sleep in the room, but the issues keep coming. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being and is upset with his girlfriend's behavior. \n\nNow, considering animal welfare, hitting the dog is a big red flag. Smacking a dog for bad behavior isn't recommended, especially if the dog isn't aggressive. The author is against it, which makes sense. Also, the girlfriend's jealousy and taking it out on the dog is problematic. She's making Moose sleep in a cold kitchen, which isn't good for the dog's comfort. Not giving treats when asked could affect training and bond. \n\nThe author has communicated his concerns and tried to find solutions, but the girlfriend isn't listening. In relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. The girlfriend is disregarding the author's boundaries regarding Moose. The author has the right to expect that his pets are treated kindly in his home. \n\nIs the author overreacting? Maybe not. The dog's well-being is a priority. The girlfriend's actions could be causing stress to the dog. The author is standing up for his pet, which is his responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend feels overwhelmed with Moose's presence? But she chose to be in a relationship with someone who has a dog. If she can't respect the terms of how the dog is treated, that's a problem. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The girlfriend's actions are harmful to the dog and disrespectful to the author's wishes. The author is justified in wanting to address this and set boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
