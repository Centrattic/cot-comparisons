He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for being upset with how his girlfriend treats his dog. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the specific issues mentioned. The author has a strong bond with his dog, Moose, who is well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, started coming over and the dog's behavior changed, becoming protective. The main points of conflict are Julia's treatment of the dog: shouting at him, smacking him, not giving treats, keeping him out of the room, and other behaviors that the author finds unacceptable.\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The author owns the home where they spend time, so the rules about the dog should primarily be his to set. The girlfriend is a guest, so her imposing her will on the dog might be overstepping. The fact that Julia is new to Moose and hasn't had prior experience with dogs might play a role, but that doesn't excuse her actions.\n\nThe author has tried to compromise, like leaving the door open so Moose can come back. However, Julia's actions, such as smacking the dog and not giving treats, are harmful. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being, which is valid. Also, the jealousy mentioned by Julia could indicate underlying issues in their relationship, but that's separate from the dog's treatment.\n\nLegally and ethically, the owner is responsible for the pet's welfare. Julia's actions might be contributing to the dog's stress or anxiety, which the author is rightly addressing. The author is setting boundaries, which is important in any relationship. Since Julia isn't living in the home, she shouldn't have the authority to dictate the dog's treatment. The author's frustration is understandable given his close relationship with Moose.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe Julia's intentions aren't malicious, but the author is being too strict. However, physical punishment like smacking is widely discouraged in dog training. Also, the author has communicated his concerns and Julia isn't respecting those boundaries, which is a red flag.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. He's advocating for his pet's well-being and setting necessary boundaries. Julia's behavior is the issue here, not the author's response to protect his dog.\n"
