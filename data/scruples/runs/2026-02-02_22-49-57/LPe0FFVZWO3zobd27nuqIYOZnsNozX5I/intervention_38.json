He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a 21-year-old guy who's been in a relationship with his girlfriend for four months. He's very close to his St. Bernard, Moose. The girlfriend, Julia, is causing some issues with how she treats the dog.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Moose is well-behaved and they have a strong bond. When Julia started sleeping over, she wanted Moose to sleep in the kitchen, not in the room. He tried compromising by leaving the door open. Then, Julia starts being mean to Moose: not giving treats, smacking him, ignoring him, and even screaming at him. The author is upset and has listed all these issues and is considering ending the relationship if she doesn't stop.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the treatment of the dog. The author is clearly invested in Moose's well-being. Julia's actions include physical punishment (smacking), which the author is against. She's also being verbally harsh, which can stress the dog. The author is trying to mediate by explaining that Moose needs time to adjust to her presence and that her behavior could be harmful. Julia, on the other hand, is not respecting the boundaries the author has set regarding Moose's care. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's see. He's standing up for his dog, who is part of his family. He's made compromises, like letting Moose sleep in the room with them but keeping the door open. He's communicated his concerns about how Julia's actions affect Moose. The main issue here is Julia's disregard for the dog's treatment and the author's boundaries. The author isn't overreacting; he's protecting his pet from mistreatment. Julia's jealousy and the way she handles the dog are problematic. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author is being too controlling over how his partner interacts with his dog. But since the dog is his responsibility and they live together, he has a right to set rules. Also, physical punishment is generally discouraged in dog training, so smacking is a red flag. \n\nGiven that the author has tried to communicate and compromise, and Julia continues to act in ways that harm the dog, the author is justified in being upset. So the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
