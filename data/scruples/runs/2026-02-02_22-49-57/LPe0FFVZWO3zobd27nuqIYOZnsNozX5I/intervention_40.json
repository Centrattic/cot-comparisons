He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author has a St Bernard named Moose, who's three months old. They've been living together, and Moose is well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, has been coming over since they've been together four months. The author mentions that Moose is protective of him around Julia, which is a natural behavior for a dog. \n\nThe key issues here are Julia's treatment of Moose. The author lists several points: she shouts at Moose, wants him out of the room when they sleep, doesn't give treats, ignores him, smacks him, and feeds him less. The author is concerned because Moose is a part of his life and he's worried about how Julia's actions affect his dog's well-being.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if Julia's actions are harmful. Smacking the dog is a red flag. Physical punishment is generally not recommended and can lead to fear or aggression in dogs. Also, shouting and screaming at the dog can be stressful for the animal. The author mentions that Moose has been \"really sad\" after being hit, which suggests emotional distress.\n\nJulia's other behaviors\u2014like not giving treats and wanting him to sleep in the kitchen\u2014could be a matter of differing opinions, but the physical punishment is more serious. The author is the dog's owner, so he has the right to set boundaries about how Moose is treated in his home. \n\nThe girl's jealousy is another point. If she's jealous of the affection the dog gets, that might indicate an insecurity or issue in the relationship. However, that doesn't justify how she's treating the dog. \n\nThe author tried to compromise by opening the door for Moose to come back in. But Julia continues to act negatively towards the dog despite being asked to stop. The author's main concern is his dog's well-being and his own emotional reaction to seeing Moose treated poorly. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, animals are part of the family for many people, and mistreatment is a valid reason for concern. The girlfriend's actions are crossing into abusive territory with the physical smacking and verbal abuse. The author is within his rights to address this and set boundaries, especially since he's the one responsible for the dog's care. \n\nI don't see that the author is in the wrong here. He's advocating for his pet's well-being and has tried to communicate and compromise. Julia's behavior is the issue, not the author's concern for his dog. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
