He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author being upset with his girlfriend's treatment of his dog, Moose. The author and the dog have a close bond, and the girlfriend's actions are causing conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a St Bernard named Moose, who is well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, started coming over and Moose became protective, sitting at the author's feet. Julia's initial reaction was shouting at Moose to get out of the room, which the author didn't like because it could stress the dog. They compromised by leaving the door open. But then Julia continued being harsh towards Moose in various ways: not giving treats, ignoring him, wanting him to sleep in a cold kitchen, smacking him, expressing jealousy, calling him annoying, screaming at him to stop barking, and feeding him less.\n\nThe author lists eight issues. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. The author is defending his dog and the bond they share. Julia's actions seem to be crossing boundaries set by the author. The author has asked her to stop, but she hasn't listened. \n\nI should consider if the author overstepped by not allowing Julia to feed the dog, but the user says they don't let her feed him anymore. However, the core issue is Julia's treatment of Moose. Smacking the dog is a big red flag. The author is against physical punishment, which is generally considered abusive. Julia's jealousy is another point; she's upset about the affection given to the dog, but the author is also affectionate towards her. \n\nThe author is trying to protect Moose from a new person who's not following his rules. The girlfriend is not a co-owner, so her actions in the author's home are under his control. The fact that she's shouting, using physical punishment, and being inconsistent with the dog's care is problematic. The author is standing up for his pet, which is reasonable. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. He's asserting that his dog should be treated kindly. Julia's behavior is the issue here. She's violating the terms they agreed upon, and the author is justified in being upset. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
