He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog. The situation is detailed here, and I need to analyze it carefully.\n\nFirst, the author (21m) has a close bond with his dog, Moose, who's a St. Bernard. They've lived together since the dog was three months old, and Moose is very well-behaved. The girlfriend (23f), Julia, has been living with her parents and spends a lot of time at the author's place. The issues start when Julia starts sleeping over. She yells at Moose to get out of the room, wants him off the sofas, doesn't give treats, smacks him, and has other negative behaviors. The author is upset about this and lists several specific complaints.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nLet me break down the key points. The author is the dog's owner and has had Moose since he was a puppy. He's invested time in training and bonding, which is significant. The girlfriend is new to Moose, lives with her parents, and has different opinions on how the dog should be treated. She's made several actions the author disapproves of: shouting, smacking, not feeding properly, not giving treats, etc. The author has tried to compromise, like leaving the door open, but the issues continue. He's even told her to ignore the dog if she's going to be mean, but she doesn't listen.\n\nNow, considering animal welfare, smacking the dog is a red flag. Positive reinforcement is standard in dog training, and physical punishment can lead to fear and aggression. The author is against it, which is correct. Also, Julia not giving treats could affect Moose's training and bonding. The author's concerns about her changing Moose's routine and shouting (which can be stressful for dogs) are valid. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective might be that she doesn't live there and is perhaps uncomfortable with the dog in the room. But since she's at the author's home, she should respect his rules regarding his pet. The author has made it clear his boundaries, and the girlfriend is crossing them. \n\nThe author is also concerned about Julia's jealousy towards the dog, which might indicate deeper issues in the relationship. But the main issue here is how the dog is being treated. The author is standing up for his pet's well-being, which is his right as the owner. \n\nIs there any way the author might be in the wrong? Maybe if he's not communicating effectively or being too controlling. However, the girlfriend is violating clear boundaries the author has set. The author has tried to compromise but Julia isn't respecting those attempts. The smacking incident is a serious issue that the author is right to be upset about. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions are harmful to the dog and disrespectful to the owner's wishes. The author is justified in wanting to address the situation and enforce his boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
