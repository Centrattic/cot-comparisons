He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author, a 21-year-old male, has a 3-month-old St. Bernard named Moose. He's been living with the dog since its arrival and has a strong bond. His girlfriend, Julia, 23, has been with him for four months and often visits his place since she still lives with her parents. The issues start when Julia's behavior towards Moose becomes problematic.\n\nLet's break down the key points:\n\n1. **Moose's Behavior**: He's well-behaved, doesn't bark much, follows commands, and is well-trained. The author has had him alone and they're close.\n\n2. **Julia's Actions**:\n   - Shouted at Moose for being in the room when they were sleeping.\n   - Wants Moose off the sofas, which the author disagrees with since she doesn't live there.\n   - Refuses to give Moose treats when asked, citing weight concerns.\n   - Smacked Moose twice, which the author is against.\n   - Ignores Moose when he comes to her for affection.\n   - Wants Moose to sleep in the kitchen, which the author says is too cold.\n   - Claims jealousy over the attention given to Moose.\n   - Screams at Moose when he barks, even though she has three big dogs at home she likes.\n   - Feeds Moose half the amount the author does, leading to him stopping her from feeding him.\n\nThe author feels Julia is being hostile towards Moose and has tried to compromise but Julia isn't listening. He's now considering telling her to stop these behaviors.\n\nNow, considering the ethics and social norms involved. Dogs are considered family members by many, and how partners treat each other's pets can be a significant issue. The author has trained Moose, and the dog is well-behaved. Julia's actions involve physical punishment (smacking), shouting, and emotional neglect (ignoring him, not giving treats). These are forms of mistreatment that the author is against. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, if one partner is consistently mistreating something important to the other, it's a red flag. The author is standing up for his pet, which is a valid concern. Julia's jealousy and negative behavior towards the dog could indicate deeper issues in the relationship, like insecurity or lack of respect for the author's values.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. The author is the owner of the dog, so he has the authority over how the dog is treated. Julia's actions are against his wishes and could harm the dog's well-being. The author is within his rights to express his concerns and set boundaries. \n\nOn the flip side, Julia might feel that her comfort and preferences are also important. However, since the dog is the author's responsibility and she's a guest in his home, her treatment of the dog should respect his ownership and care standards. The author's main issue is with her negative behavior towards Moose, not her presence or preferences per se.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say the author should have addressed this sooner or that Julia's actions are minor. But considering the list of issues provided, it's a pattern of behavior that's affecting the dog's well-being and the author's relationship with his partner. The author is trying to communicate, but Julia isn't cooperating, leading to escalating tension.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is defending his pet and setting boundaries. Since Moose's welfare is at stake and the author is the owner, he's not in the wrong for objecting to how Julia treats his dog. The real issue might be whether Julia is open to compromise and respecting the author's rules. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the circumstances, B (No) seems correct.\n"
