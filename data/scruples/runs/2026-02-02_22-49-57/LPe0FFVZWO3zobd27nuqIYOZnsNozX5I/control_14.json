He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is upset because his girlfriend treats his dog poorly. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, Moose is a St Bernard, three months old, and the author has been living with him alone. They have a close bond. The girlfriend, Julia, started coming over, and Moose acts protective by sitting by the author's feet. That's normal behavior, right? But when Julia sleeps over, she yells at the dog to get out of the room. The author thinks this is harsh and could stress the dog. He compromises by keeping the door open so Moose can come back after they sleep.\n\nThen Julia starts being mean in other ways: not giving treats, smacking the dog twice, wanting him in a cold kitchen, screaming at barks, etc. The author lists eight issues. He's firm on his stance that the dog is his responsibility and doesn't want Julia to hit him or be harsh. He's already told her to ignore the dog if she can't be nice, but she doesn't listen. Now he's considering ending the relationship if this continues.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key here is about shared living dynamics and boundaries. Since Julia doesn't live at the author's place, maybe the author is right in setting boundaries. The dog is his pet, so he's entitled to decide how it's treated. Julia's actions\u2014hitting the dog, yelling, ignoring the author's requests\u2014are concerning. Physical punishment like smacking is definitely a red flag. The author is protecting his pet, which is his right. Julia's jealousy might explain some behavior, but that doesn't justify mistreatment. The author tried to compromise, but Julia isn't respecting his rules. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
