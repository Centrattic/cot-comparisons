He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author being upset with their girlfriend's treatment of his dog, Moose. The author lists several issues: shouting at the dog, wanting him off the sofa, smacking him, not giving treats, etc. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that Moose is well-behaved and they've had a close bond. The girlfriend, Julia, started coming over and Moose became protective. The first incident was Julia shouting at Moose to get out of the room. The author felt this was harsh, especially because Moose was just reacting to a new person and the shouting might scare him. Then Julia continued to be unkind, smacking the dog twice, which the author firmly opposes. \n\nThe key points here are the treatment of the dog. Smacking the dog is a form of physical punishment, which many dog trainers advise against because it can lead to fear or aggression. The author's stance is that Moose doesn't need smacking and that Julia isn't his owner, so she shouldn't be making those decisions. Also, Julia's jealousy over the affection given to the dog suggests she might feel neglected, but that's not a valid reason to mistreat the dog.\n\nThe author has tried to compromise, like leaving the door open, but Julia didn't follow through. The author is now considering confronting her again. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nLooking at the situation, Julia's actions towards the dog could be considered abusive or at least contributing to a stressful environment for Moose. The author is standing up for his pet's well-being, which is a valid concern. The fact that Julia is visiting but treating the dog poorly without consulting the owner (and against his wishes) seems problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about his dog being mistreated. So the answer is B.\n"
