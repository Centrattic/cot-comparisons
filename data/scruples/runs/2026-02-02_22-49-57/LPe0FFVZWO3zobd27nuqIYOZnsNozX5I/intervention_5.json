He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is a 21-year-old guy with a St Bernard named Moose, and his girlfriend (23-years-old) is treating the dog badly. The author is upset about how she's handling the dog and is considering telling her to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are the author's strong bond with his dog, the girlfriend's negative behavior towards the dog, and the author's reactions. The author mentions that Moose is well-behaved and that he's been living alone with him. When the girlfriend started coming over, Moose became protective, which is a natural response. The girlfriend's actions include shouting at the dog, smacking him, not giving treats, feeding him less, and not allowing him in certain areas. The author is frustrated because he's invested in Moose's well-being and doesn't want his girlfriend's actions to affect the dog negatively.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants to know if that's correct. So, I need to evaluate the dynamics here. The girlfriend is a guest in the author's home, so she doesn't have the same authority over the dog as the owner does. The author is the one responsible for Moose's care and training. The girlfriend's actions\u2014like smacking the dog, shouting, and changing his routine without consulting\u2014are problematic. The author's concern about the dog's emotional state and his attempt to set boundaries (like the compromise about the door) show he's trying to manage the situation. The girlfriend's jealousy and inconsistent treatment of the dog are also contributing factors.\n\nBut wait, maybe the author could have addressed the issues more directly. He mentioned he's told her multiple times, but she doesn't listen. The girlfriend might feel neglected, but that doesn't justify her treatment of the dog. The author has the right to protect his pet, especially when the girlfriend isn't living there and doesn't share the same responsibility. The fact that she has her own dogs at home but is still critical of Moose's behavior might indicate a deeper issue, like insecurity or jealousy, but that doesn't make her actions right.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the dog's well-being is the owner's primary concern. The girlfriend's actions are harmful and disrespectful towards the pet, which is a valid reason for the author to be upset. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to stop her from mistreating Moose. However, it's worth noting that communication and setting clear boundaries are important. The author might need to have a serious conversation about how his girlfriend's behavior is affecting both him and the dog. But in terms of right or wrong, the author is justified in his feelings.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The girlfriend's actions are inappropriate, and the author is correct in feeling upset and needing to address the situation.\n"
