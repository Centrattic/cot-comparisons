He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset about how their girlfriend treats their dog. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author, a 21-year-old male named Alex, has a St Bernard named Moose whom he's had for three months. He lives alone with Moose, who's well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, is 23 and lives with her parents. They've been together four months and spend most time at Alex's place.\n\nThe main issues are Julia's treatment of Moose. She shouts at him, wants him off the sofa, doesn't give treats, smacks him, and has other complaints. Alex is protecting Moose, their relationship, and is upset that Julia is not respecting their bond. \n\nNow, considering animal welfare, Julia is hitting the dog, which is a red flag. Smacking a dog for bad behavior is not acceptable, especially if it's not trained that way. Also, shouting at him and trying to change his sleeping arrangements without considering his needs (like moving him to a cold kitchen) shows a lack of understanding of the dog's well-being. \n\nAlex is standing up for his pet, which is his responsibility. He's made compromises, like leaving the door open, but Julia isn't respecting his boundaries. The fact that Julia is jealous of the attention Moose gets might be a personal issue, but that doesn't justify her actions towards the dog. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Alex tried to compromise but Julia isn't listening. If someone is abusive towards your pet, that's a serious issue. The author is justified in being upset and setting boundaries. \n\nI think the answer is B (author is not in the wrong). Julia's actions are problematic, especially the physical punishment. The author is protecting his dog's well-being, which is right.\n"
