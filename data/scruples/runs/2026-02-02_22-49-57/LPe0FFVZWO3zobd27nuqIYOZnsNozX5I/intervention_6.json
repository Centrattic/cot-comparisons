He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with how his girlfriend treats his dog. The author, a 21-year-old guy, has a very close bond with his St Bernard, Moose, who's well-behaved. He's living alone with Moose and they've been together for three months. The girlfriend, Julia, is 23 and lives with her parents, so they spend most time at his place. The issues started when Julia started sleeping over and began changing Moose's routine in ways that upset the author.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Moose is protective of him when Julia is around, sitting at his feet. Then, Julia told Moose to get out of the room when they were sleeping, shouting at him. The author tried to compromise by leaving the door open. But Julia continued being harsh: not giving treats, smacking Moose twice, sending him to the kitchen (which is cold), and other behaviors. She's also jealous of the affection the author gives Moose.\n\nSo, the main points here are about the treatment of the dog. The author is clearly upset because Julia is using harsh methods (shouting, smacking) and not respecting the established routine. The author has tried to communicate and compromise but Julia isn't listening. The author is considering ending things if she doesn't stop.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. From the author's perspective, he's responsible for Moose's care and well-being. He's invested time in training and bonding with the dog. Julia's actions could be seen as undermining his authority and potentially harming Moose emotionally or physically. The fact that Julia is new to the situation and hasn't lived with the dog before might not excuse her behavior if she's aware of the author's concerns.\n\nOn the other hand, Julia might feel that she has some input since she's living with the dog now. However, she doesn't live there permanently, so her authority over the dog's routine should be limited. The author has the primary responsibility as the owner. Smacking the dog is a red flag, as it's considered inappropriate and potentially abusive. Also, not giving treats or ignoring the dog's behavior when asked could be seen as not respecting the owner's wishes.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, differing opinions on pet care can cause tension. The author has tried to address the issues directly but hasn't seen improvement. If Julia is consistently disregarding his boundaries and the dog's well-being, the author is justified in taking a firm stance. The key here is that the author is advocating for his dog's welfare, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's actions are causing stress to the dog and conflict in the relationship. The author is not wrong for prioritizing his dog's well-being and setting boundaries with his partner.\n"
