He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend and their dog.\n\nSo the author is 21, has a St Bernard named Moose, and they're close. The girlfriend, Julia, is 23, and they've been together four months. She spends a lot of time at the author's place. The issues start when Julia treats Moose poorly. The author lists several things Julia has done, like shouting at the dog, not giving treats, smacking him, etc. The author is upset about this and considering telling Julia to stop.\n\nHmm, the author's main concern is how Julia treats their dog. The key points here are about respect for the pet and the author's boundaries. The author raised Moose alone and has a strong bond. Julia's actions (shouting, smacking, not following the agreed compromise) are causing stress to both the dog and the relationship.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for being upset? Well, the author has the right to set boundaries regarding their pet. If Julia isn't respecting Moose's needs or the author's wishes, then the author is justified in addressing this. The author tried compromises, like leaving the door open, but Julia didn't follow through. Plus, physical punishment (smacking) is a red flag for animal welfare. The author's concern for Moose's well-being is valid.\n\nJulia's jealousy of the attention given to the dog might indicate deeper issues in the relationship. However, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their dog's treatment. The fact that Julia doesn't live there but still imposes her rules complicates things. The author's stance that Moose is their responsibility and how he's treated matters is reasonable.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their pet and addressing issues that affect their relationship with the dog. Julia's actions are problematic, and the author is within their rights to ask for changes.\n"
