He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend and their dog. So, first, I need to read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is 21, has a St Bernard named Moose, who's three months old. They've been living together since getting the dog, and Moose is well-behaved. The girlfriend is 23, they've been together four months, and she lives with her parents, so they spend more time at his place. The main issue seems to be how the girlfriend treats Moose. \n\nInitially, Moose becomes protective when she's around, sitting at the author's feet. When she sleeps over, Moose is in his bed in the author's room, but the girlfriend shouts at him to get out of the room. The author isn't happy because shouting could stress the dog and changing the routine suddenly. They compromise by leaving the door open. Then the girlfriend starts being \"nasty\" in other ways: not giving treats, ignoring him, wanting him to sleep in the kitchen (too cold), smacking him twice, expressing jealousy, calling him annoying despite her family having three big dogs, screaming at him when he barks, and feeding less. The author lists these issues and is considering ending the relationship if she doesn't stop.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants confirmation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, with options A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nSo, analyzing this: The author has a strong bond with his dog, which is understandable. The girlfriend's actions include physical punishment (smacking), not following the agreed compromise, ignoring the dog's needs (sleeping in a cold kitchen), and being verbally harsh. She's also showing jealousy towards the dog. The author has tried to communicate and compromise, but she's not listening. The author's stance is that his dog is important and he doesn't want her treating him poorly, which is a valid concern. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It seems like the main issues are on the girlfriend's side. She's not respecting the dog's routine and the author's wishes. The author is advocating for his dog's well-being, which is a responsibility as the owner. The girlfriend's behavior could be problematic, especially the physical punishment, which is generally considered inappropriate. The author's frustration is justified here. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a perspective where the author's expectations are too high. The girlfriend is new to the dog, living in a different environment, and might not understand all the training. But the key points are that the author has explained his stance, there's been a compromise that wasn't respected, and the girlfriend's actions are harmful. \n\nSo, the answer here would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his dog's treatment, which is his responsibility. The girlfriend's actions are the problematic ones here.\n"
