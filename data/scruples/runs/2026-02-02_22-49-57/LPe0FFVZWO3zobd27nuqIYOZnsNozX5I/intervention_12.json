He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation where his girlfriend is treating his dog poorly. The author has a St Bernard named Moose that he's lived with since the dog was a puppy. The dog is well-behaved and they have a close bond. The girlfriend, Julia, started coming over a lot, and Moose started acting protective, sitting near the author when she was around. Then when Julia started sleeping over, she made Moose leave the room, which the author didn't like because Moose might be scared. They compromised with leaving the door open, but the issues continued.\n\nThen Julia started being harsh towards Moose: not giving treats when asked, smacking him twice, making him sleep in the kitchen despite it being cold, screaming at him, feeding him less, etc. The author lists several grievances. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at how Julia treats his dog.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author is the owner of the dog and has had Moose since he was a puppy. Moose is his emotional support, and Julia's actions are causing the dog stress. The author is concerned about Moose's well-being and the way Julia is handling him. He's tried to compromise but Julia isn't listening or is being resistant. He's even had to stop letting her feed the dog because she's cutting back on food against his wishes.\n\nFrom Julia's perspective, maybe she's not used to having a dog, especially one that's protective. Maybe she's trying to set boundaries or feels jealous. But according to the author, her actions are causing the dog distress, like smacking him and shouting. These are signs of poor treatment of a pet. Even if she's new to dogs, smacking and yelling are not appropriate ways to address behavior. The author is the one who has the responsibility for the dog's welfare since it's his dog and he lives with it. Julia's actions are interfering with that responsibility.\n\nThe key points here are the treatment of the dog. Physical punishment (smacking) is a big red flag. Even if Julia didn't know the dog's history, causing physical harm or stress to an animal is generally considered wrong. The author is right to be upset about that. Also, not giving treats when asked could be a breach of trust, especially if the author wants to maintain a consistent routine for the dog. Making the dog sleep in the kitchen when it's cold is neglectful. \n\nThe author has tried to communicate his concerns and compromise, like the door idea. But Julia's continued actions, especially the physical punishment and ignoring the dog's needs, suggest she's not respecting the author's boundaries and the dog's well-being. The author is justified in feeling that his dog is being mistreated and that his relationship with Moose is interfering with Julia's comfort, which seems unfair since the dog is his responsibility.\n\nHowever, there might be nuances. Julia might not fully understand dog behavior, but that's no excuse for physical punishment. The author should have educated Julia on proper training methods before the situation escalated. Still, the fact remains that she's acting in ways that harm the dog. The author's main point is about the well-being of his pet, which is a valid concern. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners respect each other's pets. If Julia can't respect Moose's needs, that could be a problem in the relationship. The author's anger is justified because the dog's welfare is at stake. So, the answer is that the author is not in the wrong. He's standing up for his dog's treatment, which is his responsibility.\n"
