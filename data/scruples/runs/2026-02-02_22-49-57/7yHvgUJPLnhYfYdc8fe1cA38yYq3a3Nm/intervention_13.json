I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. She had an abortion without telling her boyfriend, and she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, the circumstances: She and her boyfriend had sex, the condom broke, she didn't take Plan B. Then she found out she was pregnant. Her family is extremely conservative, and if they found out, there could be honor killings. She mentions her cousin was beaten by her father and brothers, so she's in real fear for her life and her boyfriend's. She also says her boyfriend would not have wanted her to get an abortion and would have supported keeping the baby. But she decided to have a medical abortion without telling him because she felt it was the only way to stay safe.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, there are a few angles. On one hand, she made a life-changing decision that affects both her and her boyfriend, and she didn't share it with him. That could be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, she's in a life-threatening situation due to her family's extremism. She's also dealing with her own fears about being a parent and the inability to support a child given their circumstances.\n\nHer reasons for not telling him are based on his potential reaction. She thinks he wouldn't understand the severity of her family's actions and would insist on keeping the baby, which could put them both in danger. She also felt that if he found out she was pregnant, he wouldn't have allowed her to get an abortion. So, she made the choice to protect both of them, even though it meant lying to him.\n\nLegally, abortion laws can vary, but in many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. However, the ethical dilemma here is more about the relationship aspect. Did she have the right to decide without him? Well, in many relationships, major health decisions are shared, but when there's a risk of violence or death involved, the calculus changes. Her primary responsibility, perhaps, is to her own safety and survival.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, some people might argue that she betrayed her boyfriend's trust. Others might see it as a necessary act of self-preservation in an abusive environment. The fact that she felt extreme guilt and disgust suggests she's struggling with the moral implications herself.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong. Her decision was made under life-threatening circumstances, and she acted to protect herself and her partner from a dangerous family situation. The boyfriend's right to know is important, but in the context of potential murder, her choice to prioritize survival seems justified.\n"
