I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an abortion done in secret due to the author's conservative family and cultural background, where an honor killing is a real concern.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's motivations. She had a pregnancy resulting from a condom breaking, and she didn't use Plan B because of her PCOS. She was worried about her family's reaction, which she says could lead to her death or her boyfriend's harm. She and her boyfriend had discussed having kids, but he didn't understand the severity of her family's potential reaction. She decided to have an abortion to protect herself and her boyfriend, and she did it without telling him because she knew he would oppose it.\n\nThe key points here are the safety of the author and her boyfriend. The author's family is described as extremely conservative, with honor killings being common. Her cousin was beaten for associating with a boy. The author's decision was based on preventing her own death and her boyfriend being harmed. She also mentions feeling guilty about the abortion and the secrecy.\n\nIn terms of moral or ethical considerations, many would argue that someone has the right to make decisions about their own body, especially in life-threatening situations. The author's decision was to avoid a potentially fatal outcome. However, the issue of secrecy and the boyfriend's right to know is another angle. The boyfriend thought he would support her if she got pregnant, but the author knew he wouldn't support the abortion. She made the decision because she believed her life was at risk.\n\nLegally, the situation varies, but assuming she did it legally in her country, there's no legal wrongdoing. Ethically, it's about balancing the boyfriend's right to know with her right to safety. The author's decision was to protect herself, which many would prioritize over the boyfriend's wishes in such extreme circumstances.\n\nThere's also the emotional aspect. The author feels guilty, which is a personal struggle, but that doesn't mean she's objectively in the wrong. The severity of the threat from her family plays a significant role here. Honor killings are a serious issue, and the author's decision could be seen as a necessary survival choice.\n\nComparing it to other situations where someone might keep a secret to protect themselves from harm, like in abusive relationships, the author's action is similar. The boyfriend's lack of understanding about the family's severity also contributes to her decision to act alone.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's decision was made under extreme pressure to avoid life-threatening consequences. While the boyfriend might feel wronged by the secrecy, the primary concern is the author's safety. Therefore, the answer would likely be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
