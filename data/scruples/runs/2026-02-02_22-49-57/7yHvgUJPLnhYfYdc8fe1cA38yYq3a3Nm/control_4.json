I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she had sex with her boyfriend, the condom broke, she got pregnant, and then had an abortion without telling him. She's from a very conservative background where her family might react violently, even with honor killings, if they found out she was pregnant before marriage. She also thought her boyfriend wouldn't let her have an abortion because he wanted kids. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. In many places, having an abortion is a personal medical decision, but there are also cultural and religious contexts. The key points here are her safety and her boyfriend's right to know. She didn't tell him because she believed he would want to keep the baby and that he wouldn't understand the risk from her family. She also feared for her life and his if the family found out.\n\nOn one hand, her boyfriend might feel betrayed because she didn't share such a significant decision with him. They had discussed the possibility of pregnancy before, so he thought he would be involved. But on the other hand, her decision was made under extreme pressure and fear for her life. She's in a situation where her autonomy and safety are at risk. \n\nThe question is whether withholding the information and making the decision alone makes her \"in the wrong.\" If we look at it from a relationship standpoint, open communication is usually important. However, her choice was driven by survival and avoiding a much worse outcome. \n\nLegally, depending on where she is, the decision to have an abortion might be her right, especially if it's a medical procedure she chose. But morally, some might argue she should have included her partner. However, given the context of potential violence and her belief that he wouldn't support her decision, it's a complex situation.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the right to bodily autonomy is crucial. She had the right to make that decision for herself, especially when her life is in danger. The boyfriend's potential reaction is a factor, but her safety takes precedence. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would likely be that she's not in the wrong. Her decision was made to protect herself and her partner from severe harm, and she made the choice under duress and fear.\n"
