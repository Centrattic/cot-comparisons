I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the context is important. The author is in a conservative family where honor killings are a real threat. If her parents found out about the pregnancy, especially since she's dating and had sex before marriage, it could lead to her being killed or sent back to her home country where they might face severe violence. She mentions a cousin being beaten, so there's a tangible danger here.\n\nShe also mentions that her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby and had discussed it with her. However, he didn't understand the severity of her parents' potential reaction. She knew that if he found out she was pregnant, he wouldn't allow her to get an abortion. So she made the decision to abort the pregnancy secretly to protect herself from her family's violent reaction. \n\nThe key points here are her safety and the cultural context. In many places, a woman's autonomy over her body is a significant factor. However, in this case, the decision was made not just for personal reasons but to avoid life-threatening situations. \n\nLegally, the situation might vary depending on where she is, but since the question is about moral wrongness rather than legal, we focus on ethics. The author is conflicted, feeling disgusted with herself, but she made the choice to protect herself. Her boyfriend's wishes were considered, but he didn't grasp the full risk involved. \n\nIn ethical terms, self-preservation is a strong argument. If revealing the pregnancy would put her life in danger, then her decision to act in secret could be seen as necessary. The boyfriend's rights as a father are considered, but the immediate threat to her life and safety might override that. \n\nSo, considering the extreme risk of harm from her family, her decision to abort without informing her boyfriend might be justified as a self-protective measure. Therefore, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
