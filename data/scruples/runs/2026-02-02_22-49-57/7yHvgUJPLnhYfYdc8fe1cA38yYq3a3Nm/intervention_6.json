I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an abortion done secretly by the author to avoid an honor killing from her conservative family. She didn't tell her boyfriend because he would have wanted to keep the baby and she believed her family would have killed her if they found out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key point here is the cultural background of the family. Honor killings are a real issue in some cultures, and the author believes her life is in danger if her family finds out about the pregnancy. She also mentions that her boyfriend was supportive of having a child if they were to get pregnant, but he didn't understand the severity of the family's potential reaction. \n\nThe author made a decision based on her assessment of the risks. She felt that having the abortion was necessary to save her life. There's a mention of her feeling guilty and disgusted with herself, indicating she didn't take the decision lightly. \n\nNow, the question is whether she is in the wrong. Legally, abortion laws vary, but the story doesn't mention any legal issues. Ethically, it's more complex. She acted to protect her life and her boyfriend's life from her family's potential violent reaction. Her boyfriend's wishes were to keep the child, but she had to make a choice considering the extreme circumstances. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, self-preservation is a primary concern. If she faced a real threat of death, her action might be seen as justified. However, the secrecy involved could be a point of contention. But given the context of her family's possible violence, the secrecy was likely a protective measure. \n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is also important. He wanted to be a parent and thought the family would eventually accept it, but the author knew better. Her decision might have been based on a more realistic understanding of her family's actions. \n\nSo, considering all factors\u2014her life being at risk, the extreme cultural context, the lack of support from her family, and the boyfriend's inability to grasp the severity of the situation\u2014it's possible that the author is not in the wrong. The decision was tragic but made under duress and to prevent a greater harm. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
