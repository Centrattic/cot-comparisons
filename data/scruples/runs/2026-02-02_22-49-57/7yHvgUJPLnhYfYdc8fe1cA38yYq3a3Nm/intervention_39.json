I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without informing her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: They had unprotected sex, a pregnancy resulted. The author comes from a conservative family where an honor killing is a real possibility if her parents found out. She and her boyfriend had discussed what they'd do if she got pregnant, and he wanted to keep the child. She decided to have an abortion to avoid the risk of her family finding out and potential violence against her and her boyfriend.\n\nThe key factors here are her safety and her family's extreme reaction. She believed that if her parents discovered the pregnancy, they would kill her and possibly her boyfriend. Her decision was made to protect herself and him. She also mentions that her boyfriend wouldn't have understood the severity of her family's potential reaction and would have insisted on keeping the baby, which led her to make the decision secretly.\n\nLegally, abortion laws vary, but assuming it's legal in her country. Ethically, it's a complex issue. The author's primary motivation was self-preservation and protecting her partner. She felt that her boyfriend wouldn't support her decision, so she acted alone to prevent a life-threatening situation. While her boyfriend had a right to know, her decision was based on immediate safety concerns. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were driven by a desire to survive and protect her partner, given her family's violent history. She faced a dire situation with limited options. Her boyfriend's lack of understanding about the severity of the situation doesn't exonerate her, but the primary responsibility for her safety lies with her. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
