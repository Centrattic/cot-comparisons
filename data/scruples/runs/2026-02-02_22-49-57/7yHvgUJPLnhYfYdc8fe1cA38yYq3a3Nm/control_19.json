I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves her getting an abortion without telling her boyfriend, primarily to avoid an honor killing from her conservative family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. The author had a pregnancy resulting from a condom break. She decided to have an abortion because she believed her family would kill her if they found out, given their conservative background and history of honor violence. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, was supportive and wanted to keep the child, so she didn't tell him, fearing he wouldn't support the abortion decision.\n\nLegally, abortions are legal in many places, but the ethical dilemma here is more about the secrecy and not informing the boyfriend. The question is whether her decision to keep the abortion secret makes her wrong. On one hand, she acted to protect her life and safety from her family's potential violence. On the other hand, her partner had a right to know, as the child was also his, and he had expressed a desire to be a father.\n\nThere's also the aspect of autonomy. The author made the decision based on her circumstances\u2014her parents' potential for violence versus the boyfriend's support. But by not involving him, she may have denied him the chance to support her in the decision, even if he would have opposed the abortion. However, she believed he wouldn't understand the severity of her family's reaction, which could have led to a conflict or him not taking the threat seriously.\n\nAnother angle is the psychological impact. The author feels guilt and regret, which adds emotional complexity. She's in a situation where her survival was at stake, which might justify her decision from a self-preservation standpoint.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the decision isn't straightforward. The author acted to save her life from a life-threatening family situation, but she withheld information from her partner who had a stake in the decision. The key here is the balance between self-preservation and the right to mutual decision-making in a relationship. Depending on the ethical framework applied (utilitarian vs. deontological), the answer might vary. From a survival and safety perspective, she's not in the wrong. From a relationship transparency angle, maybe she is. However, given the extreme risks she faced, the decision might be seen as necessary for her survival, which is a stronger moral consideration.\n"
