I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author got pregnant after a condom broke. She didn't take Plan B because of her PCOS and her doctor's advice. Then she found out she was pregnant. Her family is from a conservative background where honor killings are a real fear. She's afraid that if her parents found out, they would kill her and maybe her boyfriend. She also mentions her cousin was beaten for associating with a boy. \n\nShe and her boyfriend had discussed what they'd do if she got pregnant. He was ready to support them, but she knew he wouldn't go along with an abortion. She felt she had to make the decision secretly to protect both of them. Now she's feeling guilty and wonders if she was wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are her safety and her family's threat. Honor killings are a serious issue in some cultures. If she had told her boyfriend, he wouldn't have agreed to the abortion, which could have put her in danger. She made a choice to protect herself and him from her family's possible violent reaction. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, it's a tough call. The question is whether she's wrong for not involving her partner. But given the life-threatening situation she's in, her decision might be seen as self-preservation. The boyfriend's desires have to be balanced against her survival. In many ethical frameworks, preserving one's life is a priority. Also, in situations of domestic or family violence, taking steps to avoid harm is often justified. \n\nHowever, withholding such a significant decision from a partner could be seen as a breach of trust. But considering the context, she might not have had a choice. If she told him, he might have insisted on going public, putting them both at risk. Her knowledge of her family's extreme reactions makes her decision a necessary evil to prevent greater harm. \n\nLegally, the situation varies, but morally, given the danger she's facing, her actions are defendable. The guilt she's feeling is understandable, but the circumstances are extreme. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because she acted to protect herself from life-threatening consequences.\n"
