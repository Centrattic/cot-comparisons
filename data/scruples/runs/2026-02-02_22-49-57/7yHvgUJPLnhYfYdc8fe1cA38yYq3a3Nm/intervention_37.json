I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The situation involves a pregnancy from a broken condom, the author's conservative family background with a high risk of honor killings, and the boyfriend's belief that he would support a child. The author hid the pregnancy and abortion because she knew her parents would kill her and possibly her boyfriend if they found out. She also thought the boyfriend wouldn't let her have an abortion.\n\nSo, the key elements here are the author's safety and her family's violent potential. Honor killings are a real and serious issue in some cultures, so if the author's life is at risk, that's a major factor. Her decision to abort was to prevent her own death and her boyfriend's, which seems like a life-saving measure. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend was kept in the dark. He wanted to be a father, and she didn't share that she was pregnant. But given the circumstances, was she justified? The author's parents would likely not accept the pregnancy, leading to severe consequences. The boyfriend didn't understand the severity, so maybe she felt it was necessary to protect him as well. \n\nIn terms of morality, this is tricky. If the abortion was a matter of self-preservation to avoid murder, many would argue it's a necessary action. The boyfriend's reaction is part of the dilemma, but if he wouldn't have allowed the abortion, and she knew her parents would kill if they found out, then not telling him was a way to prevent him from taking a stance that could lead to their deaths. \n\nIs there a wrong here? It depends on perspective. If the question is about the decision to have an abortion, in the context of imminent danger, no. But not informing the partner... But the partner's potential reaction might have put them both in danger. So the author's choice was between two impossible options. \n\nI think the answer is B, No. The author is not in the wrong because she prioritized her life and safety in a situation where her choice was to terminate the pregnancy or risk her and her boyfriend's lives. Honesty is important, but when there's an imminent threat, self-preservation is a strong ethical justification.\n"
