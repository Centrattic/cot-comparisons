I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe key points are: They had unprotected sex because the condom broke, she didn't take Plan B due to PCOS. She found out she was pregnant. Her family is very conservative, from a place where honor killings are common. She's worried that if they found out, her family would kill her and maybe her boyfriend. She had previously told her boyfriend about her parents' potential reaction, but he didn't take it seriously. She decided to have a medical abortion at nine weeks without telling him because she believes he would have wanted to keep the baby. Now she's feeling guilty because she did it behind his back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. In many places, abortion is a legal and personal decision, but it's also a sensitive topic. The woman made a choice based on her fear of her family's extreme reaction, which she claims could lead to her death. She also mentions that her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the child and she went against his wishes by not informing him.\n\nFrom her perspective, she made a decision to protect herself and her boyfriend from her family's violent reaction. She didn't take Plan B initially because of her PCOS and the belief that getting pregnant was hard for her. She was euphoric but also terrified because of the circumstances. She felt that keeping the baby wasn't an option due to her family's potential actions. She also mentions that if her boyfriend had known, he would have tried to stop her from getting an abortion. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally, if abortion is legal in her country, then she's not breaking the law. However, the ethical part involves her partner's rights. He might argue that he has a right to know about the pregnancy and to be involved in the decision. But on the other hand, she's in a life-threatening situation if her family finds out. She's also considering her own safety and her boyfriend's safety.\n\nSome might say that she should have discussed it with her boyfriend, even if he didn't understand the severity of her parents' reaction. But she's in a unique situation where her life is at risk, which complicates the decision. She might feel that she couldn't risk involving him because he wouldn't take the threat seriously, and she's afraid that if he insisted on keeping the baby, it would put them both in danger.\n\nAnother angle is her mental health and the emotional toll. She's disgusted with herself for the abortion and for not telling him. This guilt suggests that while she believes her decision was necessary, she's also aware that it might not be seen the same way by others, including her boyfriend. \n\nHonor killings are a real and serious issue in many cultures, so her fear isn't unfounded. She's making a choice to save her life, which is a strong ethical justification. However, the decision to have an abortion without her partner's knowledge might be seen as a breach of trust, depending on the relationship dynamics. But in this case, the partner doesn't seem to understand the severity of the situation, which might mean that he wouldn't have been supportive or might have put pressure to keep the child, thereby increasing the risk.\n\nI should also consider the context of her family's background. She mentions that her cousin was beaten up for associating with a boy. This implies that her family's actions are extreme and not based on legal or ethical frameworks but on their own cultural norms, which are violent. Therefore, her decision to hide the pregnancy isn't just about her own safety but also about preventing harm to her partner, which is a significant factor.\n\nIn summary, while the partner's right to be involved in the decision is important, the author's safety and the life-threatening consequences of her family knowing about the pregnancy are paramount. Her decision, though difficult, was made under extreme circumstances to prevent violence and death. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong, given the context. However, there's a personal conflict because she's hiding the decision from her partner, which can strain the relationship. But in this case, the immediate danger outweighs the ethical obligation to her partner.\n"
