I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the woman and her boyfriend had unprotected sex, leading to pregnancy. She has PCOS, making getting pregnant harder, so she was both excited and scared. Her family is conservative with a history of honor killings. If her parents found out, it could be life-threatening for her and her boyfriend. She's worried about safety, not just for herself but for him too. \n\nShe mentions she and her boyfriend had discussed what they'd do if she got pregnant. He was supportive and wanted to be a father, but she knew he wouldn't understand the severity of her parents' potential reaction. She decided to have an abortion secretly to protect them both. Now she feels guilty and conflicted.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally, in many places, abortion is a woman's right, but there's the ethical angle. She didn't inform her partner, which could be seen as a breach of trust. However, her decision was based on safety and the extreme risk of honor-based violence. She likely believed she was protecting both herself and her boyfriend, even if it meant keeping the decision private. \n\nOn one hand, withholding such a significant decision from a partner can strain the relationship and is a matter of trust. On the other hand, the context of life-threatening consequences adds a layer where her choice might be seen as a necessary action to survive. The boyfriend's perspective is valid, but his not fully understanding the danger might have contributed to her decision. \n\nConsidering the risks involved, her decision to act alone could be justified as a protective measure. The emotional toll she's experiencing shows she's conflicted, which humanizes her situation. So, while there's an argument about trust and communication, the extreme circumstances might absolve her of being \"in the wrong.\" The answer leans towards B (No), as her actions were driven by survival and safety in a high-stakes scenario.\n"
