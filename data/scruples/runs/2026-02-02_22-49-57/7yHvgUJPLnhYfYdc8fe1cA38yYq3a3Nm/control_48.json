I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation she described. Let me start by breaking down the key points.\n\nShe got pregnant after a condom broke. She didn't take Plan B because of her PCOS and her doctor's advice. She was worried about STDs first. Then she took a pregnancy test, it was positive. She was excited about possibly being able to have kids but also scared because of her family's conservative views. Her family is from a place where honor killings happen, and they wouldn't approve of her being in a relationship. She and her boyfriend had discussed what they'd do if she got pregnant, and he wanted to keep the baby. She thought if he knew, he wouldn't let her have an abortion. So she decided to have a medical abortion without telling him, even though she feels guilty about it now.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. She had a valid reason related to her safety and her family's potential violent reaction. Honor killings are a real issue in some cultures, so there's a genuine risk to her life if her parents found out. On the other hand, she kept the pregnancy and abortion a secret from her boyfriend, who she says would have wanted to be part of the decision. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, abortion laws vary, but in many places, it's legal within certain time frames. Since she had a medical abortion at nine weeks, that might be legal in her location. However, the morality of the situation is more complex. She believes she's making a choice to save her life, but her partner wasn't involved in the decision. \n\nEthically, there's a conflict between her right to make decisions about her own body and her partner's right to be informed and involved. However, in cases of imminent danger to life, self-preservation is often prioritized. Her choice was based on protecting herself from lethal consequences. \n\nBut some might argue that she should have involved her boyfriend, even if he didn't understand the risks. She mentions he thought her parents would eventually accept it, but she knew they wouldn't. There's a trust issue here. Did she have the right to make that decision alone? \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, when someone's life is in danger, the right to self-defense and self-preservation is paramount. Her decision might be seen as necessary for survival. However, the secrecy and lack of communication with her partner could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, if her parents found out, both she and her boyfriend could be in danger. She had to choose between two bad options: risking her life by keeping the child (and possibly being killed) or having an abortion but keeping it secret. \n\nI think the key here is the severity of the threat she's facing. If her life is genuinely at risk, then her decision is more understandable. However, the secrecy might weigh on her and her relationship. But given the context, her actions were to prevent a far worse outcome. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she made a life-saving choice under extreme circumstances, even though it involved secrecy. The alternative would have been far more dangerous. The ethical justification for self-preservation in life-threatening situations usually overrides other considerations.\n"
