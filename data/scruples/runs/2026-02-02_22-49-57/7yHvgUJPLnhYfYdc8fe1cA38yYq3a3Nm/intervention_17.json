I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about getting an abortion without telling her boyfriend. First, I need to understand the key points she's making.\n\nShe had an accidental pregnancy after a broken condom. She's from a very conservative family where honor killings are a real threat. She mentions her cousin was beaten for being with a boy, so she's genuinely scared. She believes that if her parents found out about the pregnancy, they would kill her and possibly her boyfriend. That's a really serious risk she's facing.\n\nShe and her boyfriend had discussed what they'd do if she got pregnant. He was ready to support her and even become a father. But she knew he wouldn't go along with an abortion. So she decided to have the abortion secretly to protect both of them. She's feeling guilty and conflicted, but her motivation was to save her life and her boyfriend's from her family's reaction.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally, abortion laws vary, but assuming the context is a place where it's legal, she's within her rights. Ethically, this is more complex. She had to make a life-saving decision under extreme pressure. She didn't want to endanger her boyfriend, who would have opposed the abortion, leading to their exposure. Her decision was based on self-preservation and protecting her partner.\n\nBut some might argue that she didn't involve her boyfriend in the decision, even though he would have wanted to be involved. However, given the high stakes of her family's reaction, she might have thought that telling him would put both of them in immediate danger. She also mentions he didn't understand the severity of her family's potential actions, which adds to her fear.\n\nHer guilt comes from the act of abortion and not sharing it with him, but her reasons are rooted in survival. In such extreme circumstances, ethical considerations often prioritize immediate safety. So, balancing her actions between the boyfriend's right to know and her safety, it seems her choice was made under duress to prevent a much worse outcome.\n\nTherefore, considering the life-threatening situation and the necessity to act alone to protect both herself and her partner, the answer is likely that she's not in the wrong.\n"
