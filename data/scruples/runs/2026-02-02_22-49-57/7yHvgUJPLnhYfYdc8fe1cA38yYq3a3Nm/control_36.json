I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an abortion done secretly due to a conservative family background that could lead to an honor killing. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's family is from a place where honor killings happen, and her parents would likely kill her if they found out she's pregnant out of wedlock. She mentions that her cousin was beaten for associating with a boy. The boyfriend is supportive and would have wanted to keep the child, but the author couldn't risk her life and her family's reaction.\n\nThe author had an abortion without telling the boyfriend because he would have wanted to keep the baby. She's now feeling guilty. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nLegally, abortion laws vary, but the story doesn't mention any legal issues. Ethically, it's complex. She acted to save her life and avoid a violent death. The boyfriend's consent was not obtained, but he might not have understood the severity of the threat. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, some might argue she had no choice because of the immediate danger. Others might say she should have included her partner in the decision. However, considering the life-threatening situation, her decision seems to prioritize self-preservation. The key factors here are survival and the lack of safe options given her family's threat. \n\nHer boyfriend's feelings are valid, but his perspective might not account for the real danger she faces. The author's actions were to prevent a tragic outcome. So, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because of the extreme circumstances she faced.\n"
