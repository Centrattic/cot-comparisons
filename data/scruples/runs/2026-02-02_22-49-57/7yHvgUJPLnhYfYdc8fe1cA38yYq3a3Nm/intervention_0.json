I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and her boyfriend had sex with a broken condom. She didn't use Plan B due to her PCOS and was worried about fertility. She got pregnant, but because of her conservative family's background\u2014where honor killings are a real threat\u2014she felt she couldn't risk telling them. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the child, but she knew that if he found out she was pregnant, he wouldn't let her have an abortion. She decided to terminate the pregnancy secretly to avoid being killed by her family and to protect her boyfriend.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a legal and ethical standpoint, this is complex. In many places, abortion is a legal right, so that's a factor. But the moral aspect is more subjective. She made a choice to protect herself from a life-threatening situation. Her family's reaction could lead to her death, which is a serious consideration. \n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is that he would have supported the pregnancy. However, the author clearly states that she believes her boyfriend underestimates the severity of her family's potential reaction. She's in a position where her safety is at stake, and she had to make a decision that prioritized her own life. \n\nThis reminds me of ethical dilemmas where one must choose between two bad options. She chose the lesser of two evils. The idea that she's \"in the wrong\" might come from the belief that she should have included her partner in the decision. But given the context of her family's violence, maybe she felt that involving him could put both of them in danger. \n\nAlso, the emotional aspect is significant. She felt guilty and conflicted, which shows she didn't take the decision lightly. She values the relationship and the potential child but felt it wasn't safe. \n\nIn terms of cultural context, her family's background is crucial. Honor-based violence is a real issue, and in such cases, the individual's safety is paramount. So, from a human rights perspective, she had to make a life-saving choice. \n\nSo, considering all factors: her safety, the potential for lethal consequences if she didn't act, her knowledge of her family's extreme reactions, and the legal right to an abortion, it seems like she's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
