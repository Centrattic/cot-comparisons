I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is she had an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The main reasons she gives are her conservative family's potential violent reaction, including possible honor killings, and her belief that her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her motivations. She's in a life-threatening situation if her family found out. Honor killings are a real and serious issue in some cultures. If her parents would kill her and her boyfriend, that's a valid fear. Her safety and life are at stake here. So from that perspective, her decision to have an abortion to protect her life and her boyfriend's might be seen as necessary.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of not telling her boyfriend. She says he would have wanted to keep the baby and not understand the severity of her parents' reaction. She felt that if he knew, he wouldn't allow her to have the abortion. So she made the choice to act alone to prevent a dangerous situation. Is that justifiable? Well, if she believed that involving him would lead to him opposing her decision and maybe even putting them in more danger, then maybe she had to keep it secret. But it's a bit of a dilemma because she withheld information from someone who would be a parent.\n\nIn terms of ethics, people often debate the right to make medical decisions, especially regarding one's own body. Since the pregnancy is hers, she has the right to decide what to do with it. However, the partner's rights or feelings come into play. But in this case, the partner wasn't aware, so it's hard to say if he was wronged. The bigger issue is the immediate danger from her family, which seems to be a more pressing concern.\n\nThere's also the emotional aspect. She feels guilty and disgusted with herself, which indicates the internal conflict. But the external factors\u2014her safety and her family's violence\u2014might override the guilt. The question is whether the harm from the abortion (and the secrecy) is worse than the harm from her family's reaction if the pregnancy were known.\n\nLegally, depending on where she lives, abortion laws vary, but given the context, it's not clear if there was a legal issue. The main ethical question is about the circumstances. Since she acted to save her life and her partner's, and given the severity of the potential consequences, her decision might be seen as justified. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong.\n"
