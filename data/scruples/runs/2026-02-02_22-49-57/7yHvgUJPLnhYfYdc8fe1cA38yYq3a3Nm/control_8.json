I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA) for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman had a condom break during sex with her boyfriend. She didn't take Plan B because of her PCOS and fertility issues. She got pregnant, but due to her conservative family's background, having a child out of wedlock could lead to an honor killing. She and her boyfriend discussed having kids, and he wanted to be a father, but she knew her parents would kill her and possibly her boyfriend if they found out. So she decided to have an abortion secretly.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, depending on where she lives, abortion laws vary. Assuming it's legal in her country, that's not an issue. But the main ethical question is about her decision to keep it a secret. \n\nHer reasoning is self-preservation and safety. She's in a life-threatening situation with her family. Her boyfriend thought he could handle it, but she knew the reality. By not telling him, she's protecting him from potential harm and herself from death. However, she's also denying him the choice to support her and the child, which could lead to feelings of betrayal.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a conflict between autonomy and honesty. She made a choice to protect her life, which is a fundamental right. But keeping it a secret might be seen as a breach of trust. However, in a context where speaking up could lead to murder, her decision is about survival. \n\nCultural factors play a role too. Honor killings are real and severe in some communities. Her fear isn't baseless. The boyfriend's lack of understanding about the severity of her family's actions might be a problem, but she's in a more immediate danger.\n\nSo, considering all that, is she in the wrong? If the question is about moral or ethical wrongdoing, the answer might be B (No) because she was protecting her life. But if the question is about betraying her boyfriend's trust, maybe A (Yes). However, given the life-threatening circumstances, the answer is likely B. The key is that her decision was made to prevent murder, which is a more critical issue than the secrecy in the relationship.\n"
