I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who had an abortion without telling her boyfriend is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the girl is in a conservative family where honor killings happen. Her parents might kill her if they find out she's pregnant before marriage. She's also worried about her boyfriend being hurt. She mentions her cousin was beaten for associating with a boy, so the stakes are really high here. \n\nHer boyfriend wanted to keep the baby and didn't realize how dangerous it would be for her family. She hid the pregnancy and had an abortion to protect herself and him. She felt terrible about it afterward, but she thought it was necessary to avoid being killed. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally, abortion laws vary, but the main ethical issue here is about her safety. She made a choice to protect her life and his from her family's violence. She was in a vulnerable position, and the alternative was a life-threatening situation. \n\nHer boyfriend might argue she should have talked to him, but he didn't understand the severity. She did consider their previous discussions but knew he wouldn't support the abortion. So, she acted to save her life. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a tough call. But given the life-threatening circumstances, many would see her actions as self-preservation. The key factors are the risk of honor killing and her belief that she couldn't have the child safely. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
