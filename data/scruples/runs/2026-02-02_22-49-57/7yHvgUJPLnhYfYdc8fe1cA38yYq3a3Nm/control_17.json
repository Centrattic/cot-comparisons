I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves her getting an abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge because of her conservative family's potential violent reaction. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman had an accidental pregnancy. She and her boyfriend had discussed what they would do if she got pregnant, and he wanted to keep the child. However, she hid the pregnancy and had an abortion because she feared her family would kill her if they found out. She believes her parents would take her home and kill her, even mentioning honor killings. She also mentions her boyfriend wouldn't have supported the abortion.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally, depending on the country, the answer might vary. But since the user is asking for a moral judgment, I should focus on that. The woman's decision was based on self-preservation and safety. She was in a life-threatening situation due to her family's beliefs. Her boyfriend, while supportive, didn't understand the severity of the risk.\n\nEthically, she might feel guilty for not involving her partner, but her choice was to protect herself from certain death. The boyfriend's desire to keep the child is valid, but his understanding of the danger was insufficient. Her actions were a desperate measure to survive. In such extreme circumstances, prioritizing one's safety is often considered morally justified. Therefore, the answer would lean towards her not being in the wrong.\n"
