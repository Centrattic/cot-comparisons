I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is complex with a lot of factors. \n\nFirst, the author mentions her conservative family background where honor killings are common. She's worried that if her parents found out about the pregnancy, especially from an unmarried relationship, they would kill her and possibly her boyfriend. She also says her cousin was beaten for interacting with a boy, so the threat is real. Her parents believe she's a virgin, and she can't risk them finding out.\n\nHer boyfriend wanted to keep the child, according to her. She says he would have been thrilled to be a father and wouldn't have let her get an abortion. She chose to get the abortion to protect herself and her boyfriend from her family's violence. She's feeling guilty and conflicted about not informing him.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle, the question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling him. On one hand, her boyfriend had a right to know about the pregnancy and the decision to terminate it. On the other hand, the decision was made out of fear for her life and her boyfriend's safety. She might have believed that informing him would put them both at risk, especially since he would not support the abortion. \n\nThe key points here are the safety and survival of the author and her partner versus the right to know about the pregnancy. In many ethical frameworks, self-preservation is a strong justification, especially in life-threatening situations. However, withholding such a significant decision from a partner could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nBut in this context, the author's actions were to prevent a much graver outcome\u2014her murder and his potential harm. Her decision was made under extreme pressure and fear. It's important to consider that in her cultural context, her parents' actions are violent and non-negotiable, so her judgment was that keeping the pregnancy would lead to certain death. \n\nAdditionally, she's struggling with guilt, indicating that she values her relationship and her boyfriend's wishes. However, her survival instinct took precedence. \n\nSo, weighing the options: if she had told her boyfriend, he might have opposed the abortion, leading to her parents finding out, which could result in their deaths. By choosing secrecy, she prioritized their lives. \n\nLegally and ethically, in many places, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is a personal one, but the situation here is compounded by external threats. The author's choice was made in the context of imminent danger, which complicates the judgment. \n\nTherefore, considering the extreme circumstances and the potential for violence, it's more likely that the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions were a means of self-preservation and protecting her partner. However, there's a valid argument about the importance of communication in relationships. But given the life-threatening nature of her situation, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
