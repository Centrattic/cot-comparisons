I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. She had an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The main reasons she gives are to avoid an honor killing by her conservative family and because she knew her boyfriend would not support the abortion. She feels guilty about it now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions her family's extreme views leading to potential honor killings. If her parents found out, she and her boyfriend could be in danger. That's a serious life-threatening situation. She also mentions her boyfriend's reaction\u2014he would have wanted to keep the baby and not have an abortion. But he didn't understand the severity of the threat from her family. \n\nSo, she made a decision based on her knowledge of her family's actions. She thought that keeping the pregnancy would put them both in danger. She had to choose between her life and her boyfriend's, and having an abortion. \n\nOn the other hand, she kept it a secret from her partner. She knew he would be against it, but she felt it was necessary. But is that the right approach? Maybe she could have found another way to communicate her fears without lying, but given the danger, maybe she had no choice. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. If we consider the potential consequences of not having the abortion (her death or serious harm), then her decision might be justified. However, from a relationship standpoint, keeping such a significant decision from her partner could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nBut when looking at the bigger picture, her survival is at stake. In many ethical frameworks, self-preservation is a primary concern. Also, the threat of honor killing is real and severe in some cultures. So, prioritizing her safety over the relationship might be understandable. \n\nHowever, the abortion was also done without the other parent's consent. Legally, in many places, both partners' consent is not required for an abortion, especially in the early stages. But ethically, involving the partner is usually advised. \n\nThe author is struggling with guilt, which suggests she knows there's a moral conflict. But given the life-threatening situation, many would argue she acted to protect herself and her partner from a greater harm. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" if we look at the immediate action (having an abortion), the legality and her right to make that decision are factors. If it's legal where she is, then she's not in the wrong legally. Ethically, the secrecy might be a point of contention, but given the context, it's a difficult choice. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because her decision was made to prevent a more severe outcome and she had valid reasons for not informing her partner.\n"
