I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author got pregnant after a condom broke. She didn't take Plan B because of her PCOS and fears about fertility. Then she found out she was pregnant. Her family is very conservative, from a place where honor killings happen. If her parents found out, she could be killed, and her boyfriend might be hurt too. She and her boyfriend had discussed that he would support a child, but she knew he wouldn't let her have an abortion. So she decided to have a medical abortion secretly.\n\nNow, the main question is whether she's in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, in many places, abortion is legal, especially early on. But the moral/ethical angle is trickier. She had her reasons: self-preservation, safety from her family. She also felt conflicted and guilty, thinking about the baby. Her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the child but didn't realize the danger from her family. She hid the pregnancy and the abortion from him.\n\nSo, considering her circumstances, she made a choice to protect herself from a life-threatening situation. She might not be in the wrong because she was trying to survive. However, she didn't consult her boyfriend, which could strain their trust. But given the severity of the potential consequences (her life), her decision might be justified. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because her actions were to prevent a deadly outcome.\n"
