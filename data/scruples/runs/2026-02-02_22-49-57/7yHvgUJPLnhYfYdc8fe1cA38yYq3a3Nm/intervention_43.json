I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the abortion story is in the wrong. They mentioned the author is not in the wrong but want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the couple had sex, condom broke, pregnancy resulted. The woman decided to have an abortion secretly because her conservative family might react violently with honor killings. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she knew her parents would kill her if they found out. She felt it was necessary for her safety and her boyfriend's safety too.\n\nLegally and ethically, abortion laws vary, but in places where it's legal, the woman has the right to make that decision. However, the moral aspect is more complex. The boyfriend didn't know, which caused him emotional distress. But she had valid reasons related to her safety and her family's extreme views. \n\nHer decision was based on self-preservation and protecting her partner. She was also dealing with the trauma of the situation. The fact that her family's reaction could be life-threatening adds a layer of urgency. While she might feel guilty for not involving her boyfriend, her choice was driven by survival. \n\nConsidering all factors, the woman acted to protect herself and her partner from a life-threatening situation. The boyfriend's reaction is understandable, but her primary concern was safety. Therefore, she isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
