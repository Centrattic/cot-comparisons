I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about getting an abortion without telling her boyfriend because of her conservative family's potential violent reaction. \n\nFirst, she mentions her family is from a place where honor killings happen. Her cousin was beaten for interacting with a boy, so the stakes are extremely high. If her parents found out about the pregnancy, it could lead to her being killed or taken to their home country for that. The boyfriend wouldn't understand how severe the situation is because he thinks her parents would just be mad and then let go. But she knows her parents would take drastic actions. \n\nShe also says that her boyfriend wanted to be a father and would not have let her get an abortion if he knew. She had to make the decision secretly to protect herself and him. She's feeling guilty because she did it behind his back, but she believes it was necessary to avoid life-threatening consequences.\n\nNow, considering the context, the question is whether she's at fault. Legally, in many places, abortion is a woman's right, but the ethical dilemma here is about deception. However, the alternative was her life and safety. She made a choice to protect herself from certain harm. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if someone is in immediate danger of death or severe violence, acting to prevent that could be justified. The boyfriend's rights are considered, but her survival takes precedence. Also, her decision was based on her knowledge of her family's actions, which she's experienced through her cousin's case. \n\nSo, balancing her right to self-preservation against the duty to inform her partner, the situation is complex. But given the extreme risk involved, her choice to act secretly to save her life and her boyfriend's safety seems to outweigh the wrong of not informing him. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
