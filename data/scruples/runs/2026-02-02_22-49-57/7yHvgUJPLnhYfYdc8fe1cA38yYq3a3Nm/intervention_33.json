I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully. The person had an abortion without telling her boyfriend because of her conservative family's potential reaction, which could lead to an honor killing. She mentions her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby, but she felt she couldn't risk her life and her family's reaction. \n\nFirst, I should consider the context. Honor killings are a serious issue, and the author is in a dangerous situation. She's from a family where such things happen, and her parents might take her back to their home country to kill her if they found out. That's a life-threatening consequence. Also, her cousin was beaten, which shows the family's extreme reactions. \n\nShe had a medical abortion at nine weeks. She didn't use plan B because of her PCOS, which makes it hard to conceive. The boyfriend thought they would handle a pregnancy together, but she knew he wouldn't support an abortion. So she made the decision alone to protect herself and him from her family.\n\nEthically, this is a tough spot. Legally, depending on where she is, abortion laws might vary. But the main conflict here is between her autonomy and the potential harm from her family. She felt that keeping the baby would put her life at risk, so her decision was to prevent a greater harm. \n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is that he would have supported keeping the baby and wouldn't have let her get an abortion. But she knew he didn't understand the severity of her family's potential reaction. There's a trust issue here\u2014she hid the pregnancy to protect him from danger, which he might view as betrayal, but she saw it as necessary.\n\nMoral responsibility: Did she have a duty to inform him? She believed her life was in danger, so her choice was based on self-preservation. However, she also might feel guilty for not sharing the burden with him, even if he wouldn't support the abortion. \n\nThe key points are the risk of her family's violent reaction and her judgment that her safety and his safety were at stake. In such extreme circumstances, many would argue that her survival takes precedence over the pregnancy. Also, the emotional toll she's experiencing shows her internal conflict and the weight of the decision.\n\nSo considering all this, the answer is likely B (she's not in the wrong) because she made a decision to protect herself from immediate life-threatening danger, even if it meant deceiving her boyfriend. Her actions were driven by necessity to avoid a far worse outcome.\n"
