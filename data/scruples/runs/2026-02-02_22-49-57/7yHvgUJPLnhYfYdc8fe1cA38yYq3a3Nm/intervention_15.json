I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author had a condom break, which led to an unexpected pregnancy. She has PCOS and was already worried about fertility. Then there's the context of her conservative family with a history of honor killings. She feared her parents would find out and that would lead to her death and harm to her boyfriend. She and her boyfriend had discussed the possibility before, but he wanted to keep the baby, while she knew her parents would react violently. She decided to get an abortion secretly because she believed it was the only way to save her life and her boyfriend's. Now she's feeling guilty but also thinks she made the right choice given the circumstances.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? From a legal standpoint, the abortion is likely legal, depending on the country. Ethically, it's tricky. She did it to protect herself and her boyfriend from her family. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the child, but he didn't understand the severity of the situation. She had to make a choice under extreme pressure and fear. She's facing potential murder if her family found out. In that case, self-preservation is a strong factor. But was it wrong to not tell her boyfriend? He might have wanted to support her, but she thought he wouldn't take the threat seriously. There's a conflict between her needs and his. However, withholding such a big decision could cause future issues, but given the life-threatening risk, maybe it was necessary. The author's intention was to prevent harm, so from that angle, she might not be in the wrong. The answer is probably B.\n"
