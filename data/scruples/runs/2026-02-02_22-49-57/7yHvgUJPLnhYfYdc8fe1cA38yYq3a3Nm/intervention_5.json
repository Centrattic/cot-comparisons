I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about her having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The main points here are the risk of honor killing from her conservative family, her boyfriend's potential reaction, and her personal reasons for the abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The woman made a choice to protect herself from a life-threatening situation. Honor killings are real and violent, so her decision might have been a matter of survival. She also mentions that her boyfriend would not support the abortion and would want to keep the baby, which led her to hide it. \n\nIn many places, the right to make decisions about one's own body is a significant factor. Even though she kept it a secret, the reasons were based on safety and her family's extreme views. The boyfriend's intentions were supportive, but he might not have understood the severity of the situation. \n\nThere's also the emotional aspect. She felt disgusted with herself and is struggling with the decision. But her actions were to prevent a tragic outcome. Legally, if the abortion was legal in her jurisdiction, that's another layer. However, the main issue here is the moral and ethical dilemma she faced.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the woman's decision was to protect her life and prevent a potential honor killing. While lying to her partner is a breach of trust, the underlying reasons are severe and life-threatening. Therefore, I don't think she's in the wrong.\n"
