I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for getting an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The main points are the risk of honor-based violence from her family and the boyfriend's reaction. \n\nFirst, the situation is life-threatening. Honor killings are real in her family's background, and she's been given an example of a cousin being beaten. If her parents found out, it could be fatal for her and her boyfriend. That's a serious safety concern.\n\nThen there's the boyfriend's perspective. He believed they would handle a pregnancy together, but he didn't understand the severity of her family's potential reaction. She knew he wouldn't support the abortion, so she made the decision alone to protect both of them.\n\nEthically, when someone's life is in danger, their choices might be seen as necessary for self-preservation. The author felt she had no other option to avoid immediate harm. However, not informing the boyfriend could be seen as a breach of trust. But considering the context, she might have thought it was the only way to prevent a tragic outcome.\n\nLegally, the situation varies by location, but the question is more about moral wrongdoing. The key factors are intent to prevent death/serious harm, lack of other options, and the boyfriend's inability to comprehend the danger. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, actions taken to prevent imminent harm are justified. The author's decision, though painful, was to protect herself and her partner. So, while the method of keeping it secret might be controversial, the underlying motivation is about survival. Therefore, the answer leans towards 'No'\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
