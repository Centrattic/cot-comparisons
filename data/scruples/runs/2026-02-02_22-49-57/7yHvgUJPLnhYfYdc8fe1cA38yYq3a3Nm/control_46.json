I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the context: The woman had a one-night stand where the condom broke. She didn't take Plan B because of her PCOS. She found out she was pregnant. Her family is extremely conservative, with a background where honor killings are common. She believes her parents would kill her and her boyfriend if they found out. She and her boyfriend had discussed having kids, and he wanted to be a father. She decided to have an abortion secretly because she felt it was the only way to avoid a dangerous situation. Now she feels guilty for not telling him.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and safety. She chose to terminate the pregnancy for reasons of self-preservation and to prevent harm. The question is whether she was wrong for not informing her partner. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including abortion. But ethically, some might argue that she should have been honest with her boyfriend. However, given the context of her family's extreme reactions and her boyfriend's potential opposition, there's a strong argument that her choice was a necessary and protective measure. \n\nHer decision was based on avoiding violence and death. If she had told her boyfriend, he might not have supported the abortion, which could have led her to reveal the pregnancy to her family, resulting in the very danger she was trying to prevent. So, her secrecy was a strategic choice to ensure her safety and her partner's safety.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that withholding such a major decision from her partner is wrong. But considering the cultural context and the severity of the consequences, her actions were a matter of survival. The emotional guilt she feels shows her internal conflict, but the external circumstances justified her decision.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong) because her actions were a response to life-threatening situations and she prioritized safety over the relationship's immediate dynamics.\n"
