I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a person who had an abortion without telling their boyfriend, primarily to avoid an honor killing from her conservative family. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts as presented. The author was in a consensual relationship, used a condom that broke, and later discovered she was pregnant. She decided to have an abortion because she believed her family would kill her if they found out, given their conservative background and history of violence. Her boyfriend was supportive of a potential child but didn't understand the severity of her family's reaction. She hid the pregnancy and the abortion from him to prevent both the danger from her family and his disapproval.\n\nThe key points here are the threat of harm to the author and her boyfriend if the family found out about the pregnancy. Honor killings are a real and serious issue in some cultures, and the author's fear is based on her cousin's experience. The decision to have an abortion was made to protect herself and her partner from immediate danger. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the question is whether the author's actions were justified given the circumstances. She prioritized her safety and her boyfriend's safety over the boyfriend's wishes. In many ethical frameworks, self-preservation and preventing imminent harm are considered valid reasons for difficult decisions. However, the secrecy involved could be a point of contention. The boyfriend had a right to know about the pregnancy and the decision, but the author believed he wouldn't support the abortion and might even oppose it, which could lead to conflict and potentially endanger them.\n\nLegally, the situation varies by location, but if the author is in a place where abortion is legal and safely accessible, her decision might be seen as a personal choice. However, the legal aspect isn't the main focus here; the user is asking about rightness in a moral sense.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact on both parties. The author feels guilt and regret, which indicates the weight of the decision. The boyfriend, while supportive of having a child, might have felt betrayed by the secrecy. But the author had a compelling reason to keep it hidden due to her family's threat.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the decision seems to be made under duress and with the intention to prevent greater harm. In such cases, many people would argue that the author acted out of necessity and self-preservation, which are often seen as justifiable reasons in ethical discussions. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
