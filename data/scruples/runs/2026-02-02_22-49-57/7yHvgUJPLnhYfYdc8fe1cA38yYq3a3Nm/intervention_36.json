I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for having an abortion without telling their boyfriend. The context is that their conservative family could kill them for premarital pregnancy, which is an honor killing scenario. The boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she felt she had no choice to protect herself.\n\nFirst, the ethical aspect. In many places, abortion is a personal medical decision, but when it's hidden from a partner, there might be questions about consent and communication. However, the main issue here is the extreme danger from her family. Her life and safety are at risk, which is a critical factor. The boyfriend didn't understand the severity of the threat, so she made the decision to act alone to prevent a much worse outcome.\n\nLegally, if her country or the place where she had the abortion allows it, then the procedure itself isn't illegal. The secrecy might be due to the external pressures, not her legal standing. Ethically, prioritizing safety from violence is a strong argument. She didn't lie to him out of malice but to avoid a life-threatening situation.\n\nThe boyfriend's feelings are valid, but his perspective seems to downplay the real danger. In a life-or-death situation, the choice to protect oneself is often seen as justified. So, while the author might feel guilty for not being honest, the circumstances are extreme. The answer is likely B because the primary wrong here is the oppressive family environment, not her decision to act to save her life.\n"
