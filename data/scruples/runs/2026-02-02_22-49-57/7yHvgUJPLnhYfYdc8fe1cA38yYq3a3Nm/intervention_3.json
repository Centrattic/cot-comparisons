I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she had a pregnancy and decided to have an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The main reasons she gives are her conservative family background with the risk of honor killings and her boyfriend wanting to keep the baby. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's from a place where her family would take extreme measures if they found out about the pregnancy. She mentions that her cousin was beaten for being with a boy, so this is a serious threat. Her safety and her boyfriend's safety are at risk. That's a strong reason for her to act to protect herself. \n\nThen there's the boyfriend's perspective. She had talked with him about what they'd do if she got pregnant, and he wanted to keep the baby. But she knew if she told him, he wouldn't let her have an abortion. She felt that keeping the baby would put them both in danger. So she made the choice to abort to prevent a life-threatening situation. \n\nIs it her fault? Well, the decision was based on self-preservation and preventing violence. While she feels guilty for not involving him, her judgment was that involving him would lead to a situation where he wouldn't allow the abortion. She also mentions she was 9 weeks along, so the abortion was within a reasonable timeframe. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people might have different opinions. Some might say she should have included him in the decision, but given the circumstances of potential violence, she might have felt it was necessary to act alone. Also, considering the risk of her family's reaction, her choice was to protect herself and her partner. \n\nSo the question is whether her actions make her at fault. Given the life-threatening context, it's hard to say she's in the wrong. She made a difficult decision under pressure. The boyfriend's desire to keep the baby is important, but her safety and his safety were paramount. Therefore, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
