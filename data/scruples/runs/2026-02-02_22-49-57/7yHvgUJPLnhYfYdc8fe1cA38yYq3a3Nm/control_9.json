I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty intense. She's from a conservative family where honor killings are a real threat. She had sex, the condom broke, got pregnant, and decided to have an abortion to avoid being killed by her family. She didn't tell her boyfriend because he wanted the baby and she thought he didn't take her concerns seriously.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The author's primary motivation was self-preservation and safety. If her family found out, she could be killed, which is a matter of life and death. Her boyfriend might not fully understand the severity of her family's potential reaction. She felt that involving him would lead to him wanting to keep the baby, which would put both of them in danger. \n\nLegally, it depends on where she lives, but the question is more about moral wrongdoing. The boyfriend's right to know about the pregnancy is important, but so is her right to safety. There's a conflict between her autonomy and her partner's involvement. She did consider the implications and believed she was making the only safe choice. \n\nIs it right to make that decision without him? On one hand, withholding such information can be seen as a betrayal. On the other, she was protecting herself from imminent harm. The key here is the extreme risk of death. In moral terms, self-defense is often justified even if it means making a tough choice without consultation. \n\nSo, considering the life-threatening situation, her decision to prioritize her safety and survival seems justifiable. The boyfriend's feelings are hurt, but the alternative was worse. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
