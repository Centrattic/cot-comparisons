I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, she and her boyfriend had sex, condom broke, she got pregnant. She decided to have an abortion without telling him because she thinks he would have wanted to keep the baby and stand by her. But her family is conservative, from a place where honor killings happen, and she's afraid they'd kill her and her boyfriend if they found out. She's also worried that her boyfriend doesn't understand the severity of her family's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles. On one hand, she made a decision without involving her partner, which is a big deal. Abortion is a significant choice, and involving the father, especially if it's a mutual relationship, is usually expected. But here, the context is different. She's in a dangerous situation where her life and her boyfriend's could be at risk. Her decision was based on self-preservation and preventing violence. \n\nThe question is whether her actions are morally wrong. The boyfriend thought he would support a pregnancy, but she knew he didn't grasp the danger. She felt that by keeping it secret, she was protecting both of them. But she also felt guilty for not including him. So, is her secrecy the wrong part, or is it justified given the circumstances?\n\nIn some ethical frameworks, autonomy is important. She had the right to make decisions about her own body. However, in a relationship, transparency is usually valued. But here, the risk of harm from her family is extreme. Honor killings are real and severe. She's in a life-threatening situation where the usual expectations of communication might be overridden by the need for self-preservation.\n\nAlso, her mental state is part of the consideration. She was conflicted, felt disgusted with herself, and wishes they could have kept the baby. She's not making a light decision; it's under immense pressure and fear. The boyfriend's perspective is that he would have supported her, but she believed he wouldn't understand the danger. So, the conflict is between her autonomy and safety versus her partner's right to be involved.\n\nLegally, abortion laws vary, but the question is about moral wrongdoing in the AITA context. The key factors are her intent to prevent violence, her belief that her partner wouldn't support her decision, and the severe risks involved. \n\nIn many discussions about such cases, people consider the context of violence and survival. If she was trying to avoid a death sentence, her actions might be seen as necessary. However, the secrecy aspect complicates it. But given the stakes, her choice might be justified as a matter of self-defense. \n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the answer would likely be that she's not in the wrong. Her decision was based on protecting her life and her partner's from her family's violence, even if it meant making a difficult choice alone. The boyfriend's position is valid, but her survival takes precedence in this scenario.\n"
