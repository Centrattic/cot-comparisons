I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the abortion story is in the wrong. The key points are: she had an abortion without telling her boyfriend due to her conservative family's potential reaction, which could lead to honor killings. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she felt she couldn't risk her life and her family's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including terminating a pregnancy. The author's decision was also based on her safety and life, which is a significant factor. Honor killings are real threats, so her fear isn't unfounded.\n\nThen, the relationship aspect: she hid the pregnancy and the abortion from her boyfriend. Was that wrong? Well, she believed that if he knew, he wouldn't support the abortion. She might have felt that involving him would put both of them in danger. But from his perspective, he might feel betrayed as he didn't get a choice. However, the situation is complex because his safety and her safety were at stake.\n\nThe user might be looking for validation of her choice versus the moral obligation to be honest with her partner. But in life-threatening situations, self-preservation is often prioritized. The ethical dilemma here is between individual autonomy and relational trust. Given the extreme circumstances, many would argue she did what was necessary to protect herself and her partner from her family's violence. \n\nAlso, considering her health condition (PCOS), she might have had fertility concerns, which adds another layer. Her decision to have an abortion was based on both immediate safety and future possibilities. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong) because she acted to protect herself and her boyfriend from a life-threatening situation, even though it meant making a tough choice in secrecy.\n"
