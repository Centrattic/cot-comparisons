I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in this Ask the Ask is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: She and her boyfriend had sex, the condom broke, and she didn't take Plan B because of her PCOS. She got pregnant. Her family is very conservative, from a place where honor killings happen. She's worried that if her parents found out, they would kill her and maybe her boyfriend. She mentioned her cousin was beaten for being with a boy. She's in a situation where her life is at risk if her family finds out about the pregnancy. \n\nShe and her boyfriend had talked about pregnancy before. He said he'd support them, get a job and apartment. But she thinks he doesn't understand the severity of her parents' reaction. She believed he would have wanted to keep the baby, so she got an abortion secretly. Now she's feeling guilty, thinking about the baby and her boyfriend's feelings.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, abortion is legal, especially in early stages. So legally, she's not in the wrong. But culturally, there's a lot here. Her family's extreme views and the threat to her life are significant factors. She had to make a choice to protect herself and possibly her boyfriend from her family. \n\nEmotionally, she's torn between her desire to have the child and the reality of her situation. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she couldn't risk her life. The key point here is the threat of her family's reaction. If the alternative is being killed, then her decision to abort to save her life is ethically justifiable. \n\nHowever, from her boyfriend's perspective, he was deprived of making a choice about his child. But given her explanation, she felt there was no other option. She was in a life-threatening situation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong). Her decision was made under extreme pressure to protect herself from lethal consequences, which is a matter of survival. While it's a difficult choice and there are emotional ramifications with her partner, her right to self-preservation is paramount here.\n"
