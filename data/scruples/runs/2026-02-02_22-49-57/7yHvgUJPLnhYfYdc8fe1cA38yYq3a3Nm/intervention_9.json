I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author had a situation where the condom broke, leading to an unplanned pregnancy. She has PCOS, making it harder to conceive, so getting pregnant was a mix of emotions. Then there's the family context\u2014very conservative, with a history of honor killings. She mentions her cousin was beaten, so the risk is real. She believes her parents would kill her if they found out, which is a death sentence. Her boyfriend is supportive of kids but doesn't realize the severity of her family's potential reaction. She decided to have the abortion secretly because she knew he would want to keep the baby and her parents would act if they knew.\n\nLegally, in many places, abortion is a right, so that's a point. But the main question is moral. She made a decision to protect herself from a life-threatening situation. The boyfriend was supportive in theory but didn't grasp the reality of her family's actions. She felt that involving him would put both of them at risk. She's also struggling with guilt, feeling like she betrayed him and herself.\n\nThe key factors here are self-preservation, the immediate danger to her life, and the lack of safe options if her family found out. The boyfriend's intentions were good, but he couldn't fully understand the threat. She chose the only option available to her to survive. In such extreme circumstances, prioritizing one's own safety is often seen as justified. The decision isn't made lightly, and she's dealing with emotional turmoil afterward, which adds to the complexity.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She made a necessary choice to protect herself in a dire situation. The boyfriend's support was real, but her judgment about her family's actions was based on her lived experience. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
