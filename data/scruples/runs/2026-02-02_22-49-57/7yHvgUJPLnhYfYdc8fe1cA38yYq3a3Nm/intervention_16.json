I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the abortion story is in the wrong. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author got pregnant after a condom broke. She had PCOS, which made conception harder, so she was excited but also scared because of her conservative family. Her parents are from a place where honor killings happen, and she's worried they'd kill her if they found out. The boyfriend wanted to keep the child, but she knew if he found out, he wouldn't let her abort, and she'd be in danger. So she had the abortion without telling him, feeling guilty about it.\n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. I have to decide based on the situation. \n\nLegally, in many places, abortion is legal, especially in early stages. So the act itself might not be wrong legally. Ethically, it's complex. She did it to protect herself from a life-threatening situation (possible honor killing). The boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she didn't feel she had a choice given her family's context. \n\nIs she morally in the wrong? It depends on your values. If you prioritize the right to make autonomous decisions about one's body and survival, she's not wrong. If you believe in honesty in a relationship and shared decisions, maybe she's in the wrong for not involving him. But her reasoning is about self-preservation, which is a strong motive. \n\nThe boyfriend's stance is to support a child, but he didn't understand the family's severity. She might have thought that involving him would lead to conflict and still result in her family finding out. \n\nI think the key points are her safety and the lack of viable alternatives. The law isn't against her, and her decision was to prevent a greater harm. The boyfriend's rights to know are important, but in a life-threatening context, her choice to protect herself is more critical. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because her decision was to protect her life and autonomy despite the relationship complications. The moral dilemma is heavy, but the immediate threat she faces from her family makes her choice understandable and, in my view, justified.\n"
