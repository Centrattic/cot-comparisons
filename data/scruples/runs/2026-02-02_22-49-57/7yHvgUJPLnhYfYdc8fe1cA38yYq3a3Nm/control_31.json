I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The woman and her boyfriend had protected sex, but the condom broke. She didn't take Plan B because of her PCOS and previous advice about fertility. She got pregnant and later had an abortion. The main reasons she didn't tell her boyfriend are because he wanted to keep the baby, and she feared her conservative family would kill her if they found out. Her parents are from a culture where honor killings are a real threat. She also mentions a cousin who was beaten for dating, so her fear isn't unfounded.\n\nNow, the ethical considerations. The boyfriend believed they would handle a pregnancy together, but the woman felt that revealing the pregnancy would put them both in danger. She chose to abort to protect herself and her partner from her family's violence. The key here is her safety and survival. In many ethical frameworks, self-preservation is a strong justification. Also, she was in a position where she couldn't have a safe pregnancy due to external threats.\n\nHowever, she kept this decision secret from her partner, which could be seen as a breach of trust. But given her belief that he wouldn't support her decision (he wanted to keep the baby), and her fear that involving him would escalate the danger, her choice to act alone might be understandable. The boyfriend's desire to raise a child isn't invalid, but her immediate safety and life are paramount in this scenario.\n\nLegally and ethically, in many places, a person has the right to make decisions about their own body, especially in life-threatening situations. The risk of honor-based violence is a serious concern, and her decision to protect herself from that threat could be seen as necessary.\n\nBut there's also the emotional aspect. She feels guilty for not telling him, and the boyfriend was supportive in discussions. However, her assessment was that he wouldn't understand the level of danger. It's a tragic situation where she had to choose between her life and the baby's life. In such cases, prioritizing survival is often considered morally justified.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would likely be \"No, the author is not in the wrong\" because her actions were in self-defense against a real and severe threat, and she made the best decision she could under extreme pressure.\n"
