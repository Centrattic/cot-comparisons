I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. Let me read through the situation again to understand all the details.\n\nFirst, there's the context of the relationship: they had sex, the condom broke, and she didn't take Plan B. She had PCOS, which made her worried about getting pregnant but also about STDs. Then she found out she was pregnant. She was excited but scared because of her conservative family background. Her family is from a place where honor killings happen, and she's not allowed to date before marriage. If they found out, they might kill her and possibly her boyfriend. She's told her boyfriend about this risk before, but he didn't take it seriously. She knew if he found out she was pregnant, he wouldn't support an abortion and would want to keep the baby. So she decided to have a medical abortion at nine weeks without telling him. Now she's feeling guilty and wondering if she did the wrong thing.\n\nThe question is whether she's at fault. The options are A (yes, she's in the wrong) or B (no, she's not). \n\nLet me break down the factors. Legally, in many places, having an abortion is a legal right, especially in early pregnancy. However, the ethical aspect here is more complex. She didn't inform her partner, which could be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, she made the decision to protect herself from a life-threatening situation (honor killing) and because she believed her partner wouldn't support her choice. \n\nShe mentions that her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby and be a father, but she felt that keeping the baby would put both of them in danger. She made a choice based on her assessment of the risks involved. Her intention was to prevent a tragedy. However, by not consulting him, she didn't include him in the decision-making process, which might be considered wrong in terms of respecting his autonomy and their relationship dynamics.\n\nBut considering the context of her family's extreme potential reaction, her decision could be seen as self-preservation. She might have felt that involving her boyfriend would lead to conflict and that he wouldn't understand the severity of the situation. Also, she might have feared that if he insisted on keeping the baby, it could lead to her being discovered by her family, increasing the danger.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the decision to have an abortion, especially in circumstances of danger to one's life or severe harm, is considered a valid choice. The secrecy might be understandable given the high stakes. However, in a relationship, withholding such a significant decision can be problematic. But given the circumstances, her primary motivation was survival and avoiding a death sentence. \n\nSo weighing the options, the author's actions were motivated by self-preservation and preventing harm, which might outweigh the ethical concern of not informing her partner. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong. However, the decision to keep it secret could be seen as wrong, depending on cultural and personal values. But given the life-threatening nature of her family's potential reaction, her choice seems more about protecting her life than a selfish decision. \n\nIn conclusion, considering the extreme risks involved, the author's decision to have an abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge might be justified as a necessary action to prevent a much worse outcome. Therefore, she is not in the wrong.\n"
