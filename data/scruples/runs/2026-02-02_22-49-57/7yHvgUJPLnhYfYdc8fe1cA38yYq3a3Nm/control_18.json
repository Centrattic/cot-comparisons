I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author got pregnant when the condom broke. She didn't take Plan B because of her medical condition. Then she found out she was pregnant and decided to have an abortion. The main reasons she gives are her conservative family's potential reaction, which could lead to an honor killing, and her boyfriend's possible reaction if he knew. She thought he would want to keep the baby and wouldn't understand the danger from her family.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, the question is about moral responsibility here. On one side, she made a decision that she believed was necessary to save her life and avoid a violent death. Honor killings are real in some cultures, and if she genuinely believes her family would kill her if they found out, that's a serious factor. She also thought her boyfriend wouldn't support the abortion, so she hid it from him. But she's feeling guilty because it was his baby too, and she didn't consult him.\n\nOn the other side, her boyfriend had expressed wanting to be a father and support her. By not telling him, she kept him in the dark about a major decision that affected him. He might have wanted to fight for their situation together. Also, withholding such information can lead to trust issues later. But her primary motivation was survival, which is a strong argument.\n\nLegally, the situation varies, but morally, it's about the circumstances. She faced extreme pressure from her family's background. The honor killing risk is a life-threatening situation. So, her decision was based on self-preservation. However, the ethical dilemma is whether she had the right to make that decision without his input, knowing it would hurt him and he had different views.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, survival is considered a top priority. If her life was in danger, her choice could be seen as necessary. The boyfriend's perspective is valid, but if he wasn't aware of the true severity of the cultural context, maybe it's her responsibility to protect herself. Still, the secrecy might have been avoidable if they could have discussed it and found a compromising solution. But given her fear that he wouldn't understand, she acted to protect herself and him from her family's violence.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because her actions were driven by life-threatening circumstances. However, the moral complexity means there's no clear right or wrong. But in the context of the question, the key point is the threat of her family's violence. If that's real, then her choice was necessary for her survival, which would mean she's not in the wrong.\n"
