I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, the user had an abortion without telling her boyfriend because she was in a conservative family where an honor killing might happen if her parents found out. She and her boyfriend had discussed their options if she got pregnant, and he wanted to keep the baby, but she knew her parents would be extremely violent if they found out. She was scared for her life and her boyfriend's safety. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. The author made a choice based on her belief that her life and her boyfriend's were in danger. In some contexts, abortion is a sensitive topic, but here the motivation isn't just personal choice\u2014it's survival. She felt that keeping the baby would lead to her death or severe harm. That adds a layer of self-preservation.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's perspective is important. He wanted to be a parent and thought he could handle the situation, but she didn't trust his understanding of her family's extremism. She might have felt that involving him would put him at risk if her parents found out. But by not telling him, she violated his right to know about the pregnancy and the decision made. That's a conflict between her safety and his right to be part of the decision.\n\nLegally, in many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. So from a legal standpoint, she's not in the wrong. Morally, it's more complicated. She prioritized her life and her boyfriend's safety over his wishes as a parent. But if her parents were truly a threat of honor killing, then her choice was a matter of survival. \n\nHonor killings are a serious issue, and in such contexts, the risk to her life is real. The author's fear isn't just paranoia\u2014it's based on her family's actions and her cousin's experience. So, her decision was made under extreme pressure and fear. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she should have found a way to involve her boyfriend, even if it meant risking his safety. But how could she have done that without putting both of them in danger? If her parents were to find out, both her and her boyfriend could be targeted, and her not telling him might have been a way to protect him from that risk. \n\nThere's also the emotional aspect\u2014she feels disgusted with herself, which shows she's struggling with the decision. This internal conflict might indicate that she believes she did something wrong, but that's her personal guilt, not necessarily an objective wrong. \n\nIn summary, the key factors are the real threat to her life, her right to make decisions about her body, and the boyfriend's right to be informed. However, the immediate danger of her family's reaction seems to outweigh the ethical dilemma of not involving her partner. Her life and her boyfriend's safety were at stake, so her choice was made under extreme circumstances where survival was the priority. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong."
