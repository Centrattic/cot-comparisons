I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA) for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is complex with multiple factors.\n\nFirst, the woman got pregnant after a condom broke. She didn't take Plan B because of her PCOS. Then she found out she was pregnant and decided to have an abortion. The main reasons she gave were her conservative family's potential violent reaction, including honor killings, and her belief that her boyfriend would not support the abortion.\n\nI need to consider her motivations. She mentions her life safety is at risk. Honor killings are a real issue in some cultures, so her fear isn't baseless. She also thought her boyfriend would want to keep the baby despite her objections. She acted to protect herself and her partner from her family's wrath.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is whether her decision to hide the pregnancy and proceed with the abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge is wrong. On one hand, she withheld information, which can be seen as deceitful. On the other hand, she was acting to protect her life and her partner's safety from a dangerous family situation. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, a woman has the right to make medical decisions about her own body, including abortion. However, the issue here is more about the moral and relational aspect rather than legal. The boyfriend's perspective is that he would have supported the child, but the woman felt that revealing the pregnancy would lead to her family's retaliation. \n\nHer actions were based on self-preservation and preventing harm. The boyfriend might feel betrayed, but the woman's survival and safety are paramount. It's a tragic situation where she had to choose between her life and the pregnancy. Considering the extreme risks involved, many would argue she made the necessary choice to protect herself and her partner. \n\nSo, while there's an element of keeping secrets, the context of life-threatening circumstances might outweigh that. Therefore, the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong.\n"
