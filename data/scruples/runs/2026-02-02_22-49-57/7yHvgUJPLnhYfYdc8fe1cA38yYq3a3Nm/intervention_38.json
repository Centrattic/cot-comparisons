I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman had unprotected sex because the condom broke. She didn't take Plan B because of her medical condition (PCOS), and she got pregnant. She decided to have a medical abortion because of her conservative family's background, where an honor killing could happen if they found out. She also mentions her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby, so she hid the pregnancy and the abortion from him.\n\nThe main points to consider here are the reasons behind her decision. She's in a life-threatening situation if her family found out. The risk of honor violence is real and severe. She also thought her boyfriend wouldn't support her decision, as he wanted to be a father. \n\nLegally, in many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including terminating a pregnancy. Ethically, it's a complex issue. On one hand, the boyfriend's right to know about his child's existence and the decision to terminate could be a point. But on the other hand, her safety and well-being are paramount. The article mentions that she was in a situation where her life could be endangered, which is a significant factor.\n\nCulturally, the pressure from her family is immense. She's in a conservative family where such a situation would lead to extreme consequences. The boyfriend's perspective is that he would support her, but she believed he didn't understand the severity of her family's reaction. \n\nEmotionally, she's struggling with guilt and the decision, which shows she's not making it lightly. She mentions feeling disgusted with herself, but that's more about the emotional impact rather than a justification of being wrong.\n\nThe key here is balancing autonomy, safety, and the boyfriend's rights. While the boyfriend might feel betrayed, her primary concern was survival and avoiding a life-threatening situation. In such extreme circumstances, the decision to prioritize her life over the pregnancy might be seen as necessary. Also, in many ethical frameworks, self-preservation is a valid reason.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no legal or ethical angle I'm missing. For example, some might argue that she should have discussed it with her boyfriend, but given his stance, she believed he would oppose the abortion. Also, in some cultures, the secrecy might complicate things, but her safety is the top priority.\n"
