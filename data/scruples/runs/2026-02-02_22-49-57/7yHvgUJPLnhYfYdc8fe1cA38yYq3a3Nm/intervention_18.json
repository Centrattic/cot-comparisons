I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge. The situation is complex, involving personal health, family safety, and relationship dynamics.\n\nFirst, the author mentions her conservative family background where an honor killing is a real fear. She explains that if her parents found out about the pregnancy, they could kill her and her boyfriend. That's a serious threat to her safety. She also says her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby and wouldn't have supported an abortion. But she felt that revealing the pregnancy would put them both in danger.\n\nShe had PCOS, making pregnancy difficult, and she was initially euphoric but terrified because of her family's reaction. She decided to have a medical abortion at nine weeks to protect herself and her boyfriend. Now she feels guilty and conflicted about doing it behind his back.\n\nLegally, in many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. Ethically, the situation is about her right to life and safety versus the boyfriend's right to know. But since her life is at risk, self-preservation is a strong argument. However, some might argue that she should have told her boyfriend, even if he didn't agree. But given the potential consequences of him finding out through other means or the family discovering it, keeping it secret might have been necessary for her safety.\n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is important too. He might feel betrayed, but the author's actions were to protect both of them. The key here is whether her decision was based on self-defense against a known threat. Since she had a medical abortion and didn't put him at risk, it's more about survival than selfishness.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the boyfriend is aware of the family's possible reaction, he should have considered that in their relationship. But the author acted to prevent immediate danger. The question is whether she was in the wrong for not involving him. However, if involving him would have led to him opposing the abortion and risking exposure, then her choice to keep it secret was necessary.\n\nSo, considering all factors: self-preservation, safety, and the boyfriend's potential reaction, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
