I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\".

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that she had an abortion without telling her boyfriend. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the context: They had sex, condom broke, she got pregnant. She has PCOS and was told it's hard to conceive without treatment. She didn't take Plan B because of that. Her family is very conservative, from a place where honor killings happen. If they found out, she and her boyfriend could be in danger. She mentions her cousin was beaten for interacting with a boy. Her parents think she's a virgin and would react violently.\n\nShe and her boyfriend had discussed what to do if she got pregnant. He wanted to take responsibility, get a job, apartment. She thought he didn't understand the severity of her family's reaction. She believed he would want to keep the baby, so she had an abortion secretly.\n\nNow, the question is if she's in the wrong. Legally, abortion is a sensitive topic depending on location, but assuming it's legal where she is, the ethical angle is more about the secrecy and the boyfriend's consent. But she felt she had no other choice to avoid life-threatening situations. She thought involving him would lead to conflict and potential harm from her family.\n\nHer reasons are self-preservation and safety. She was protecting herself and the boyfriend from her family's violent response. She also felt guilty for not telling him, so that's an emotional part. On the other hand, her boyfriend might have wanted to support her and the child, so she didn't give him a choice.\n\nBut in her cultural context, the danger is real. Honor killings are a serious threat. She might have felt that even trying to talk to him wouldn't help because her family would act. She's in a high-risk situation. The boyfriend's perspective is that he would have supported the child, but he might also be in danger if he knew. So she's balancing two bad outcomes.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, some might say she was wrong for not being honest with her partner. Others would argue that in life-threatening circumstances, her self-preservation is justified. The key here is the safety versus the relationship's integrity.\n\nIn AITA contexts, people often consider intentions and consequences. Her intention was to prevent harm, which is a strong moral point. The consequence is that she hid the pregnancy and abortion. But given the severity of the potential consequences from her family, many might see her as not in the wrong. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
