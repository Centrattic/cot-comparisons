I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation involves a pregnancy after a broken condom, with the woman considering her conservative family background and the risk of an honor killing. She and her boyfriend had discussed having a child, and he wanted to be a father, but she knew her parents would be violent if they found out. She chose to have an abortion secretly because she believed her boyfriend wouldn't support the decision and her parents would harm them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Honor killings are real and severe threats in some cultures. The woman's life and her boyfriend's safety are at risk. Her decision to hide the pregnancy and proceed with an abortion could be seen as a way to protect herself and her partner. However, the boyfriend wasn't part of the decision-making process, which might lead to questions about consent and shared responsibility in their relationship.\n\nOn one hand, she made a choice to protect her life and safety. On the other, she kept it a secret from her partner, which might be seen as a breach of trust. But given the cultural context and the severity of the potential consequences, her actions might be justified as self-preservation. The boyfriend's perspective is that he would have supported keeping the child, but she knew her parents' reaction would be deadly. It's a complex situation where personal safety conflicts with relationship dynamics.\n\nLegal aspects vary by location, but the question here is more about moral responsibility. Since she acted out of fear for her life and her partner's, many might empathize with her choice. The key factors are the immediate danger from her family and the lack of support from her boyfriend in this specific context. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because her decision was made to prevent a life-threatening situation, even though it involved secrecy.\n"
