I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author had an abortion without telling her boyfriend, fearing her conservative family would harm her if they found out. The boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, while the author felt it was necessary to protect herself and her family from violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral angles here. The author made a decision based on her safety and her knowledge of her family's potential violent reaction. She mentions honor killings and her cousin's experience, which adds context to her fear. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, believed they could handle the situation and wanted to keep the child. By not informing him, she acted unilaterally, which could be seen as deceitful from his perspective. \n\nBut then, the author's primary motivation was self-preservation and preventing harm. She was aware of the risks her family posed and believed that involving her boyfriend would lead to his opposition to the abortion, which he was adamant about. There's a conflict between her need for safety and his right to know about the pregnancy and make joint decisions. \n\nLegally, in many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including abortion. However, the ethical dilemma here is whether she should have shared the decision with her partner. But given the extreme danger involved, her choice to act alone might be justified as a necessary precaution. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If we consider intent and consequences, her decision was to avoid life-threatening situations for herself and her boyfriend. However, withholding such a significant decision from her partner could be seen as a breach of trust. But given the cultural context and the severity of the threat, her actions might be viewed as self-defense. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she should have found a way to involve her partner despite his potential disagreement, as the child's father has a right to be part of the decision. But the author's knowledge of her family's extreme actions and her cousin's beating complicates this. She might not have seen another safe option. \n\nConsidering all factors, the answer would hinge on whether the decision was made out of necessity to protect herself from imminent harm. In such cases, ethical frameworks often prioritize self-preservation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted to save her life and prevent violence, even if it meant making the decision without her partner.\n"
