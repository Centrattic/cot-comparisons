I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the woman who got an abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge is in the wrong. The situation involves a complex set of factors.\n\nFirst, she had a contraceptive failure, which led to an unplanned pregnancy. She mentions she has PCOS, making pregnancy difficult, so she was worried about that initially. Then she found out she was pregnant and felt conflicted but decided to have an abortion. The main reason she hid it from her boyfriend is because he would have wanted to keep the baby, and he didn't understand the severity of her family's conservative background and the risk of honor-based violence. She feared her parents would kill her if they found out, referencing her cousin's experience. \n\nThe key points here are her safety and autonomy. In many places, medical abortion is legal, so from a legal standpoint, she's not in the wrong. Her decision was based on protection from potential harm by her family. The boyfriend believed they would handle the situation together, but she felt that revealing the pregnancy would put both of them in danger. \n\nHer choice to act without his consent was to prevent a life-threatening situation. While it's true that she didn't share the decision with him, her primary motivation was survival. The boyfriend's perspective is valid\u2014he wanted to support the pregnancy\u2014but her autonomy and safety take precedence in this scenario. The question is about morality and rights. Since she acted to protect her life and avoid violence, it's a matter of self-preservation. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
