I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about getting an abortion secretly from her boyfriend because of her conservative family's potential violent reaction. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The woman had a protected sex where the condom broke. She didn't take Plan B because of her PCOS and was told it might be hard for her to conceive. Then she found out she was pregnant. Her family is very conservative, with a history of honor killings. She knows her parents would kill her if they found out about the pregnancy because she's not married. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she knew he wouldn't understand the severity of her family's threat.\n\nShe decided to have a medical abortion secretly. Now she's feeling guilty and wonders if she was wrong. The user thinks she's not in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects here. Is her decision to protect herself from potential honor killing justifiable? In many places, having an abortion is a legal right, though it's a sensitive topic. However, the context here is life-threatening. If her family would kill her, then her decision to terminate the pregnancy could be seen as an act of self-preservation. Also, she was hiding it from her boyfriend because he wanted to keep the baby, but she felt it was necessary for her safety. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she should have informed her partner, even if he disagreed. But given the boyfriend's lack of understanding about her family's severity, maybe not involving him was the only way to protect both of them. She mentions her cousin's experience, which adds to the credibility of the threat. \n\nLegally, in many countries, abortion is legal up to certain points, so she wasn't breaking the law. The ethical dilemma is balancing the right to life of the fetus against her right to safety and life. Since her life is at imminent risk due to her family's violent tendencies, her decision to terminate the pregnancy can be seen as necessary for survival. \n\nTherefore, considering all factors, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). The key here is the danger from her family, which makes her decision a form of self-defense. Additionally, she was under immense stress and had to act quickly to protect herself and her boyfriend from harm.\n"
