I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she had an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The main reasons she gives are her conservative family's potential reaction, which could lead to an honor killing, and her belief that her boyfriend would not have supported the abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical perspectives. On one hand, she made a choice to terminate the pregnancy to protect her life and safety. Honor killings are a serious threat, and her decision might be seen as a necessary action to survive. On the other hand, her boyfriend was not part of the decision, and he had expressed a desire to be a father. The act of keeping the pregnancy secret could be seen as a betrayal, as he was a parent and had a right to be involved.\n\nBut wait, the key here is the context of her cultural background and the extreme danger she faces. Her parents would kill her if they found out, and the boyfriend might not fully grasp the severity. She had to make a choice between her life and the pregnancy. In such high-stakes situations, the ethical priority might be self-preservation. \n\nAlso, in many places, a person has the legal right to make decisions about their own body, including terminating a pregnancy. However, the boyfriend's perspective is that it was his child too, which complicates things. But in legal terms, the decision to have an abortion is up to the pregnant person, even if the partner disagrees.\n\nHer feelings of guilt and regret after the abortion are also important. She's struggling with the emotional burden of the choice, which adds another layer of complexity. The trauma of potential family violence versus the trauma of the abortion and secrecy.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the decision was made under extreme pressure to avoid a life-threatening situation. While the boyfriend did lose the opportunity to be involved, the author's safety and survival are critical. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong, as the decision was necessary to prevent immediate harm. However, some might argue that withholding information from her partner is a breach of trust. But given the life-threatening context, the priority was survival, which might outweigh the betrayal in this case.\n"
