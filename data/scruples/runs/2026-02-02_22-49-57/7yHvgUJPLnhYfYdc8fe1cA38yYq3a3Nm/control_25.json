I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author's background is from a very conservative family where honor killings are common. She's worried that if her parents found out about the pregnancy, which resulted from premarital sex, they might kill her and her boyfriend. She mentions her cousin was beaten severely, so the risk is real. She decided to get an abortion to protect herself and her partner, knowing that her boyfriend would want them to keep the child but she believed he didn't understand the severity of her parents' potential reaction.\n\nThe boyfriend had a different perspective; he thought her parents would be angry but eventually accept it. The author, however, knew her parents would not and that getting an abortion was necessary. She felt extreme guilt and made the decision alone.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong, we need to consider ethical perspectives. Legally, in many places, abortion is permissible, though laws vary. Ethically, it's more nuanced. The author's decision was based on self-preservation and protecting her partner's life from her family's violence. However, she withheld the decision from her boyfriend, which might be seen as a breach of trust in a relationship. But given the context of her family's threat, this secrecy might be understandable as a survival mechanism.\n\nThe boyfriend's stance is that he would support the child, but the author felt that his perspective was naive given the real danger. So, her action was a choice between her safety and her partner's, versus the potential loss of life if she had kept the child. \n\nIn terms of moral culpability, some might argue that she should have discussed it more openly, but considering the life-threatening situation, her secrecy was a protective measure. Her decision was influenced by a dire situation where the alternatives were extremely harmful. Therefore, while the act of keeping it a secret might be seen as a personal failing in the relationship, the broader context of her life-threatening circumstances complicates the judgment. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) given the extreme danger involved and the lack of a safe alternative.\n"
