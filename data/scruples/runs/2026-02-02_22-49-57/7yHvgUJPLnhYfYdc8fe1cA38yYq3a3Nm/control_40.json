I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting an abortion without telling her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The woman had unprotected sex because a condom broke. She didn't take Plan B because she has PCOS and was worried about fertility. She later found out she was pregnant. Her family is very conservative, with a history of honor killings. She's afraid that if her parents found out, they would kill her and possibly her boyfriend. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the child, but she knew he wouldn't understand the danger her family poses. So she had an abortion secretly.\n\nThe main ethical considerations here are her safety and autonomy. She's in immediate danger from her family if they discovered the pregnancy. Her boyfriend didn't realize the severity of the situation. Legally, she might not be in the wrong depending on where she lives, but the question is more about moral responsibility.\n\nIs she wrong for not telling him? Well, she thought he wouldn't support her decision. She believed he would try to keep the baby despite the risks. By not telling him, she protected herself from a life-threatening situation. On the other hand, she didn't consider his right to know about the pregnancy, especially since it's his child. However, given the context of her life-threatening circumstances, her choice might be seen as necessary for survival.\n\nThe dilemma is between her right to life and her partner's right to know. In such cases, self-preservation is often prioritized. Also, the boyfriend's lack of understanding about her family's potential actions could mean he's not in a position to make the best decision for her safety. So, while she withheld information, her motivation was to avoid a deadly outcome, which complicates the judgment of her being in the wrong.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), she isn't in the wrong because she acted to protect her life and safety, which is a fundamental right. Her decision, while difficult, was made under extreme pressure and a valid fear of violence.\n"
