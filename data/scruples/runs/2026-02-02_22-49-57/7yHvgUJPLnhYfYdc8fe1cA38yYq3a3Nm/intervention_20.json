I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about her getting an abortion without telling her boyfriend because of her conservative family's potential violent reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her motivations. She mentions her family's history with honor killings and how they wouldn't accept a pregnancy at all. She also explains that her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby, but she felt keeping it would put her and him in danger. She did the abortion to protect her life and his, which is a significant factor.\n\nLegally, abortions are legal in many places, but the ethical aspect might depend on cultural and personal beliefs. However, the main issue here is the safety of the individuals involved. She felt it was necessary to act alone because revealing the pregnancy would lead to fatal consequences. \n\nThere's also the emotional angle. She's struggling with guilt and wishes they could have kept the baby. But she made a choice based on the information she had and the risks involved. The boyfriend, while supportive in theory, didn't understand the severity of the situation with her family. \n\nI think the key points are the threat to her life and her boyfriend's safety. In such circumstances, prioritizing safety might be considered justifiable. Even though she didn't share the decision with him, her reasons are rooted in survival. Ethically, it's a complex situation where the immediate danger overrides other considerations. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
