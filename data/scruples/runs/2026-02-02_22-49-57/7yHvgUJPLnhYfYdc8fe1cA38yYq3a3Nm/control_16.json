I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for having an abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is from a conservative family where honor killings occur. If her parents found out about the pregnancy, it would be life-threatening for her and possibly her boyfriend. She's worried about being forced to return to her home country and face violence. Her boyfriend, while supportive of a potential child, doesn't fully grasp the danger from her parents. She decided to have a medical abortion at 9 weeks without telling him because she knew he would want to keep the baby.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, abortion is a personal medical decision, and laws vary. But the key here is the safety and life-threatening situation she's in. If she hadn't had the abortion, her life would be at risk. That seems like a valid reason to prioritize her safety. \n\nEthically, there's a conflict between autonomy and the boyfriend's rights. She made a decision to protect herself, but did hide it from him. However, given the extreme consequences if he had found out and opposed the abortion, maybe she had no choice. She mentions he would have wanted to keep the child and not understand the danger. So, if she'd told him, he might have tried to stop her or she might have been pressured to keep the baby, which could lead to her parents finding out. \n\nThe emotional aspect is also significant. She feels guilty and conflicted, which adds to the complexity. But the primary issue is survival. In such cases, self-preservation is often considered a valid reason for difficult decisions. \n\nSo, considering all factors\u2014the threat to her life, the lack of support from her boyfriend in understanding the danger, and the necessity of the abortion to prevent harm\u2014she might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that she should have communicated with her boyfriend despite the risks, but given the severity of the consequences, her choice seems justified. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
