I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about her getting an abortion without telling her boyfriend. There are a lot of factors here. First, she mentions her conservative family background where honor killings are common. She's worried that if her parents find out she had a child out of wedlock, they might kill her and her boyfriend. She also says she's been told by her boyfriend that he would support them if she got pregnant, but she knew he wouldn't go along with an abortion.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, having an abortion is a personal choice, but the circumstances here are unique. Her safety is at stake because of her family's possible reaction. She's facing a life-threatening situation if her parents found out. So, in that context, her decision might be seen as self-preservation. However, she didn't inform her boyfriend, who was willing to support her, which could be a point of contention. He had a right to know about the pregnancy and the decision to terminate it. \n\nOn the other hand, she believed that if she told him, he would not support the abortion, leading to potential conflict and maybe even forcing her to confront her parents. She felt she was making a choice to protect both her and her boyfriend's lives. But withholding such a major decision from someone who is part of the situation is a big issue. Trust and communication are important in any relationship, and keeping this secret could strain their relationship even if her motives were to prevent harm.\n\nThere's also the emotional aspect. She feels guilty and disgusted with herself, which indicates internal conflict. Her boyfriend wanted to be a father and support them, so her decision might have hurt his feelings. However, her primary concern was survival, which adds another layer.\n\nSo, the key points are: her safety versus her partner's rights to know. In many ethical frameworks, the right to life and safety is a fundamental right. If her family would kill them for this, then her decision to abort to prevent that is a matter of life and death. But ethically, the partner's right to consent and be involved in such a significant decision is also important. \n\nIn some cultures, family honor is taken extremely seriously, which can lead to violent outcomes. Her choice to terminate the pregnancy to avoid that outcome is a direct response to cultural pressures. However, the method of hiding it from her partner might be seen as a breach of trust, even if her intention was to protect both of them.\n\nIn conclusion, while her decision was made under extreme duress and to ensure her safety, the lack of communication with her partner is a significant ethical issue. However, considering the life-threatening context, her primary responsibility was to protect her life. So, whether she's in the wrong might depend on the perspective taken\u2014legal, ethical, cultural, or relational. But given the severe consequences she faced, it's reasonable to argue that she wasn't in the wrong.\n"
