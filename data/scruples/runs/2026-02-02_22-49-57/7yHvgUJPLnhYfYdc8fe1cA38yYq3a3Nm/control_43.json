I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The main reasons given are the fear of an honor killing from her conservative family and the belief that her boyfriend would not support an abortion. She mentions her family's history of violence against women for premarital relationships, and that her cousin was beaten. The boyfriend, however, believed that her parents would be mad but eventually accept it, while she knew they would be more severe.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical implications. The author made a decision to have an abortion to protect herself and possibly her boyfriend from harm. However, she did so without informing her partner, which he might have wanted to be involved in. The question is whether her choice to keep it secret makes her wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author's decision might be seen as self-preservation. Given the extreme danger from her family, hiding the pregnancy and proceeding with an abortion alone could be a necessary step to survive. Her life and safety are at stake, which is a strong justification for her actions.\n\nOn the other hand, not informing her boyfriend could be seen as a breach of trust. The boyfriend had expressed support for a child, and she knew he would not agree to an abortion. By keeping the pregnancy secret, she didn't give him the chance to be part of the decision. This might be considered a lack of communication and respect for his potential involvement and feelings as the father.\n\nBut considering the context, if she had told him, he might have insisted on keeping the child, which could have led to both of them being in danger. The author believed her judgment was correct in prioritizing her safety over her partner's wishes. In such high-stakes scenarios, the decision to act alone might be necessary even if it's painful for both parties.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the focus is on the act of having an abortion secretly, some might argue she should have tried to find another way to communicate or compromise. However, given the life-threatening situation and the boyfriend's likely opposition, her choice might be seen as necessary for survival. Therefore, the answer might depend on prioritizing self-preservation versus the ethical obligation to inform a partner.\n"
