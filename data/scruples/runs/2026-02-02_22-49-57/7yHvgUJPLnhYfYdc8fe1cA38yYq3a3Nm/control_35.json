I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an answer based on the given situation. \n\nFirst, let's recap what's happening. The person had an accidental pregnancy due to a broken condom. They had PCOS and were told it might be hard to get pregnant, so maybe they didn't consider Plan B. The boyfriend wanted to keep the baby if there was a pregnancy, but the author decided to have an abortion without telling him because of the risk of honor killing from their family. The author feels guilty about not telling the boyfriend and about the abortion itself.\n\nNow, the key points here are autonomy, safety, and consent. The author made a decision to protect themselves from a life-threatening situation\u2014honor killing is a real and extreme risk. The boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but the author felt that doing so would put them both in danger. The author's decision was based on their own safety and survival, which is a strong ethical consideration.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the right to bodily autonomy and self-preservation is paramount. The author's choice to terminate the pregnancy without the boyfriend's knowledge might be seen as a necessary act to prevent a far worse outcome. However, some might argue that the boyfriend had a right to know, especially since he was involved in the relationship and possibly the pregnancy. But given the context that the boyfriend didn't understand the severity of the author's family's reaction, there's a valid reason for not sharing the information. The author thought the boyfriend wouldn't support the abortion, which could have led to conflict or even endangering both of them by revealing the pregnancy.\n\nAlso, considering the cultural context where honor killings are a real threat, the author's decision might be viewed as a necessary measure to survive. The boyfriend's potential reaction (not wanting an abortion and being happy about the baby) is valid, but the author's own safety takes precedence in such a scenario. The author's mental and emotional state is also important\u2014they felt disgusted and guilty, which shows they're struggling with the decision, but the circumstances are extreme.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, lying to the boyfriend was a way to protect both their lives. The boyfriend might feel betrayed, but the author's survival is a critical factor. Different cultures and ethical systems can weigh these factors differently. From a human rights perspective, the right to life and safety is fundamental, so the author's decision to protect themselves against a lethal threat would be justified.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author made a difficult choice to prevent a horrific outcome. While the decision to not inform the boyfriend could be seen as a breach of trust, the context of imminent danger and the belief that the boyfriend wouldn't support the abortion makes it a complex situation. The author is not in the wrong because their actions were primarily to protect their own life and safety, which is a higher priority.\n"
