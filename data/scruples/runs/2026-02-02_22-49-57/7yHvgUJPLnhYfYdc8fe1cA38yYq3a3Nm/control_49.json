I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is complex. She had an accident where the condom broke, didn't take Plan B, got pregnant, and decided to have an abortion to avoid being killed by her family for an honor crime. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she knew her parents wouldn't accept it and would take violent action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's decision was based on self-preservation and protecting her boyfriend. Her family's extreme views and history of violence against women for dating are significant factors. She felt that revealing the pregnancy would put her life in danger and her boyfriend's as well. \n\nOn the other hand, she didn't consult her boyfriend, who was supportive of having children. He might have felt betrayed because he was ready to take on the responsibility. However, the author believed he underestimated the severity of her family's reaction. There's a conflict between her safety and the boyfriend's wishes. \n\nLegally, abortion laws vary, but in this case, she had a medical abortion, so it's presumably legal. The moral question is whether her actions were justified given the life-threatening situation. She chose to protect herself from a potential honor killing, which is a serious issue in some cultures. \n\nHer mental state is also important. She felt disgusted and conflicted, which shows the emotional toll. The decision wasn't made lightly; she weighed the consequences of each option. Given that her life was at risk and her boyfriend's safety too, her choice to act alone might be seen as necessary. \n\nThe boyfriend's position is understandable, but his lack of awareness of the severity of her family's threats is a key point. The author had to act to save herself, and she believed that telling him would lead to him opposing the abortion, which would put them both in danger. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's decision was made to prevent her own murder and protect her partner. While it's a tough choice and withholding information caused guilt, the alternative was much worse. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
