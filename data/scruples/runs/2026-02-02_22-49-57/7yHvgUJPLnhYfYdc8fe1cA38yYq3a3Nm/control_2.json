I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who had an abortion without telling her boyfriend is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the woman and her boyfriend had sex, and the condom broke. She didn't take Plan B because she has PCOS and was told it might be hard to conceive, so she was more worried about STDs. Then she found out she was pregnant. She's from a conservative family where honor killings are common. She's afraid that if her parents found out, they would kill her and maybe her boyfriend too. She mentions her cousin was beaten for dating someone. \n\nShe and her boyfriend had discussed what they'd do if she got pregnant. He wanted to be there, get a job, an apartment, and thought it would be a blessing. She told him about her family's potential reaction, but he didn't think it'd be that bad. She knew he wouldn't let her get an abortion if he found out. So she decided to have a medical abortion at nine weeks without telling him. Now she's feeling guilty and is questioning if she did the right thing.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break it down. Legally, abortion laws vary, but the question is more about moral or ethical wrongdoing rather than legal. Ethically, she made a decision based on her safety and life. Her family's violent potential is a real threat. She also didn't want to risk her boyfriend's life. She might have lied or withheld information to protect him. However, she didn't consult him, which could be seen as a breach of trust. But given the context of her family's danger, maybe her choice was necessary for survival. \n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is that he would have wanted to keep the child and support her. But his view might not account for the actual danger they're in. The woman's decision was to prevent a life-threatening situation. In such cases, self-preservation is often considered morally justified. Also, the psychological impact of being forced into a situation that could lead to death outweighs the ethical dilemma of making a decision without full consent. \n\nSo, considering the severity of the threat from her family, her decision to act unilaterally might be seen as protecting her own life and her boyfriend's. Therefore, she's not in the wrong because her actions were necessary to prevent harm. Answer B.\n"
