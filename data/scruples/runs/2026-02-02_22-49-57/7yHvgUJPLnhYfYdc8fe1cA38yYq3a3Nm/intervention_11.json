I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author had an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The main reasons given are fear of an honor killing from her conservative family and the boyfriend's insistence on keeping the child despite the risks. The author believes her parents would kill her if they found out about the pregnancy, and she also thinks the boyfriend wouldn't support her decision to have an abortion. \n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, is she in the wrong? Well, the key points are her safety and autonomy. In many places, access to abortion is a legal right, though it's a controversial topic. The author made a choice based on her belief that continuing the pregnancy would lead to her death. In such a life-threatening scenario, the decision to terminate might be seen as necessary for self-preservation. \n\nHowever, she didn't inform her boyfriend, which could be a point of contention. The boyfriend wanted to be a father, and he might feel betrayed or that his parental rights were disregarded. But considering the potential for her being killed or severely harmed, the author prioritized her immediate safety over his wishes. That raises questions about whether her choice was ethically justified given the extreme circumstances. \n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend's lack of understanding about her family's violence complicates things. If he couldn't grasp the severity of the risk, maybe it's not entirely her fault for not sharing. She might have felt that explaining the situation wouldn't change his stance, leading her to act alone to protect herself.\n\nIn terms of the law, depending on where she lives, having an abortion might be legal, but hiding it from a partner isn't necessarily illegal. The ethical question is more about whether she had the right to make that decision without his input. However, in life-or-death situations, personal autonomy often takes precedence. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, it seems the author acted out of necessity to protect her life and safety. While the decision might be ethically complex, the primary motivation was survival, which is a strong justification. The boyfriend's wishes are valid, but when faced with immediate danger to her life, her choice to prioritize her own safety seems defensible. Therefore, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
