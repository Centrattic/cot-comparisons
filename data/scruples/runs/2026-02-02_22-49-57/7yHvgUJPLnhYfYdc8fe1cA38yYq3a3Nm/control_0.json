I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, the user had an abortion without telling her boyfriend because she thought her conservative family would react violently, even possibly leading to an honor killing. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she didn't want to risk her life or his. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, getting an abortion is legal, especially in the early stages. So legally, she might not be in the wrong. Then there's the ethical side. She made a decision without her partner's knowledge, which could hurt him. But she had valid reasons based on her family's background. She feared for her life and her boyfriend's safety.\n\nThe boyfriend believed they would keep the baby, so her not telling him might have broken his trust. But she thought he didn't take her warnings about her family seriously. Is her action justifiable under the circumstances? She had to make a choice between her life and the pregnancy. Honor killings are real issues in some cultures, so her fear isn't unfounded. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend had a right to know about the pregnancy. Deception is involved, which could cause him emotional pain. But considering the risk of death if her family found out, her decision might be seen as a necessary sacrifice. \n\nI think the key here is the life-threatening situation she faced. If she had told her boyfriend, he might have insisted on keeping the baby, which could lead to her being discovered by her family. Her choice to prioritize her survival, even if it meant deceiving her partner, might be understandable. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because she acted to protect herself from extreme harm.\n"
