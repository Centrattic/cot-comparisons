I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an abortion done secretly from the boyfriend due to the risk of honor violence from her family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is in a conservative family where honor killings are a real concern. Her parents wouldn't accept her being pregnant out of wedlock. She mentions her cousin was beaten for associating with a boy, so the threat is serious. The boyfriend was supportive and wanted to keep the child, but she didn't think he understood the danger from her family. She got the abortion to protect herself and possibly her boyfriend from her family's reaction.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angles. The main points are her safety, her family's extreme views, and her decision to not tell the boyfriend. On one hand, she made a life-altering decision without consulting her partner, which could be seen as dishonest. On the other, the alternative was risking her life and her boyfriend's. The decision was made in a context of life-threatening pressure from her family.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally, abortion is a complex issue, but morally, it's about her survival. She weighed the risks and chose the option that saved her life. The boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but he didn't realize the danger. Her choice to protect herself from certain death might outweigh the betrayal in the relationship.\n\nAlso, considering her health and PCOS, the pregnancy could have health risks. But the main issue here is the cultural context and survival. The user might be looking for an answer that balances the moral dilemma between the decision to abort and the secrecy involved. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, self-preservation is a priority. The boyfriend's support is important, but if sharing the news would lead to him being targeted too, her decision to act alone was necessary. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the alternative was far more severe consequences. The secrecy was a result of her assessing the situation as life-threatening, so she acted to prevent that.\n"
