I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. First, I need to consider the context she provided. She's in a conservative family where an honor killing is a real threat if they found out about the pregnancy. Her parents wouldn't accept her dating or having a child out of wedlock. She mentions her cousin was beaten for just hanging out with a boy, so the danger is significant.\n\nShe had an accidental pregnancy, and even though she and her boyfriend had discussed being ready for kids, she knew he would want to keep the baby. She feared that revealing the pregnancy would put both her and her boyfriend in danger. So she decided to get an abortion secretly. Now she's struggling with guilt and wondering if she did the right thing.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, assuming this is in a country where abortion is legal, she had the right to make that decision. Her main motivation was self-preservation and protecting her partner from her family's violence. The boyfriend didn't understand the severity of the situation, which led her to act alone. \n\nEthically, this is complex. While the boyfriend's desire to parent is valid, her safety and life are paramount. Withholding information was to protect both of them. Honesty is important in relationships, but in life-threatening situations, survival might override that. She didn't want to risk her life or his for a pregnancy she couldn't realistically carry to term given her family's extremism.\n\nThe key points here are the threat to her safety, the knowledge that her partner wouldn't support the abortion, and the life-threatening consequences of revealing the pregnancy. These factors likely mitigate her responsibility for not being honest with her boyfriend. So, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
