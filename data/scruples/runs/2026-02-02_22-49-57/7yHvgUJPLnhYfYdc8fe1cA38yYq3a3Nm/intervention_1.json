I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that she had an abortion without telling her boyfriend because of the risk of an honor killing by her conservative family. She and her boyfriend had discussed being ready for a child, but she felt she couldn't risk her life or his by revealing the pregnancy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The author made a decision to protect herself and her boyfriend from potentially life-threatening consequences. Her family's background with honor killings is a real and serious threat, which she's aware of from her cousin's experience. She believes that if her parents found out, they would kill her and possibly harm her boyfriend as well. That's a heavy burden and a life-threatening situation.\n\nOn the other hand, her boyfriend wanted to keep the child and was supportive. By not telling him, she took away his choice in the matter. However, the key point here is the safety and survival aspect. If she had told him, and then he wanted to proceed with the pregnancy, the risk of her family finding out and acting violently would have been even higher. Her decision to abort the pregnancy was based on self-preservation and protecting her partner. \n\nLegally, abortion laws vary by location, but assuming she had access to a legal medical abortion, that's a factor. But the main issue here is the moral dilemma: her right to self-defense versus the ethical choice of involving her partner. Given the extreme danger involved, her choice to act unilaterally might be seen as necessary. \n\nAdditionally, the author felt immense guilt and emotional pain, which shows her internal conflict. She wasn't making a decision lightly but was forced by circumstances beyond her control. The boyfriend's reaction was based on his own desires without fully understanding the severity of the risks involved. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions were driven by survival and preventing harm. While there's a valid argument about withholding information from her partner, the life-threatening situation seems to outweigh that. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
