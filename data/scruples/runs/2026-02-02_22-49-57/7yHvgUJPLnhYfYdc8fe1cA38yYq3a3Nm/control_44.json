I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether she did the right thing by having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is from a conservative family where honor killings are a real threat. Her parents would kill her if they found out about the pregnancy because she's not married. She had a broken condom, got pregnant, and decided to have an abortion secretly because she knew her boyfriend would want to keep the baby. She felt she had no other choice to protect herself and her boyfriend from her family's violence.\n\nSo, the key points here are her safety and the safety of her boyfriend. Her family is extremely dangerous, and she's in a life-threatening situation. The boyfriend didn't realize the severity of the threat. She couldn't risk telling him because he wouldn't support the abortion, which would put both of them in danger. \n\nEthically, this is a tough spot. On one hand, she made a decision without her partner's knowledge, which could be seen as not being honest. But on the other hand, her life is at stake, and she's taking a massive risk to avoid being killed. The boyfriend's belief that the parents would eventually accept it doesn't match her reality. She knows her parents better and is in a much more vulnerable position. \n\nLegally, getting an abortion might be complicated depending on where she is, but the question isn't about legality. It's about moral responsibility. The author is trying to survive in a situation where her choices are extremely limited. She's also dealing with guilt, which shows she values the life of the baby, but sees no other option. \n\nIn such cases, many people would argue that her safety is the top priority, especially when facing such extreme violence. The boyfriend might not fully understand the danger, but her decision is based on her lived experience with her family. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she made a difficult choice to protect herself from a life-threatening situation, even if it meant not being honest with her partner. The moral weight here is on preserving her life and her partner's safety, which is a stronger consideration than the secrecy involved in the decision.\n"
