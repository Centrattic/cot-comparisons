I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is she had an abortion without telling her boyfriend because she's worried about her conservative family's reaction, which could lead to an honor killing. Her boyfriend didn't know and he would have wanted to keep the baby. She's feeling guilty about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Her family's background is really strict, and she's at risk of being killed if they find out. That's a serious threat. She also mentions her cousin was beaten for dating a boy, so this isn't hypothetical for her. She felt that keeping the baby would endanger both her life and her boyfriend's. \n\nHer boyfriend wanted to be a father and support her, but he didn't understand the severity of her family's reaction. She thought he would try to protect her, but she knew her parents would not let it go. So she made a decision to have the abortion to protect them both.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, in many places, abortion is legal, so she's not breaking the law. But morally, the boyfriend's side might argue that she didn't include him in the decision, which could be a breach of trust. However, her main motivation was survival and preventing violence. She was in a life-threatening situation if she had told anyone. \n\nOn the other hand, she did take away his choice in the matter. He wanted to be a father and support them. But considering her knowledge of her family's extreme reactions, she might have felt that revealing the pregnancy would lead to unavoidable violence. \n\nThis is a complex ethical dilemma. Her action was to prevent immediate harm to herself and her boyfriend. In such situations, some might argue that her self-preservation is justified, especially when the alternative is death or severe violence. Others might focus on the importance of shared decision-making in a relationship. However, given the context of her family's threats, her decision was made under extreme pressure to avoid life-threatening consequences. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because her actions were to protect herself from a dangerous situation, even though it involved keeping the pregnancy a secret.\n"
