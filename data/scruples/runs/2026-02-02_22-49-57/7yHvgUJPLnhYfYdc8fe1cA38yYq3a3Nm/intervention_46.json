I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the abortion story is in the wrong. They want a yes or no answer based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the story. The woman had a broken condom, didn't take Plan B, got pregnant. She's from a conservative family with a history of honor killings. Her parents would kill her if they knew. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the child, but she decided to have an abortion in secret because she feared for her life. Now she's feeling guilty and is asking if she's at fault.\n\nSo the main factors here are her safety, her cultural context, her boyfriend's wishes, and the legality/ethics of her decision. In many places, having an abortion is a personal choice, but there's also the aspect of not informing the partner. However, considering the extreme danger she'd face if her family found out, her decision might be seen as self-preservation.\n\nThe boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, which adds emotional complexity. But she had a valid reason to keep it secret due to life-threatening risks. The question is whether she's in the wrong for keeping the pregnancy and abortion a secret. \n\nIn terms of ethics, some might argue that she should have at least discussed the options with her boyfriend, but given the context that he would not support the abortion and she feared he wouldn't understand the danger, maybe she felt it was necessary to act alone. Her life was at stake, which is a critical point. \n\nLegally, in many regions, a woman has the right to make reproductive decisions. The question is more about moral responsibility here. Since she wasn't physically able to carry the pregnancy to term due to external threats, her choice might be seen as justified. \n\nHowever, others might say that she should have communicated with her partner, even if he didn't agree. But the story emphasizes that he wouldn't understand the severity of her family's reaction. So maybe she felt it was necessary to protect both herself and him from her family's retaliation. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. Her decision was made under extreme pressure to protect her life and the lives of others, even though it involved a difficult and secret choice.\n"
