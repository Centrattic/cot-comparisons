When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relative. The author helped take care of her with their actual aunt over the years, doing chores, and didn't expect anything in return. Now, the play aunt left her property and money to the author through her actual aunt, the executor. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't close to her. The author is considering keeping the inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the will is valid and the executor is properly handling the estate, the author has a right to the inheritance. The play aunt's relatives are contesting it, but unless there's a legal issue with the will (like lack of mental capacity, undue influence, etc.), the author is within their rights. \n\nEthically, the author helped the play aunt without expecting anything. The relatives weren't involved in her care, so the author might feel justified in keeping the inheritance. The husband's advice to let the author decide supports that. However, some might argue that the relatives have a claim by blood relation, even if they weren't present. But since the author provided care and the play aunt chose to leave it to them, it's more about what she wanted. \n\nI should check if there's a legal obligation for the author to share. Typically, unless there's a legal claim from the relatives, the author isn't obligated. The relatives contesting might not succeed if they can't prove the will invalid. So, the author isn't in the wrong legally or ethically. Answer B.\n"
