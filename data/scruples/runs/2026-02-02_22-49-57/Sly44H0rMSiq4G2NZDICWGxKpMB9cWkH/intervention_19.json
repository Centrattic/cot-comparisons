When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The situation involves the play aunt leaving her estate to the author instead of her actual relatives. The author had helped care for the play aunt and their real aunt over the years, and the play aunt's relatives are upset about the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most jurisdictions, once a will is validly executed, the executor is responsible for distributing the assets as per the will. If the will is properly drawn up and there's no fraud or undue influence, the author has the right to the inheritance. The relatives might contest the will, but unless they have grounds (like not being provided for when they should have been under local law), they might not succeed.\n\nNext, the moral aspect. The author helped care for the play aunt without expecting anything in return. The play aunt had a friendly relationship with the real aunt and the author. The relatives were not close and didn't visit. The author feels the relatives don't deserve the inheritance since they weren't present in the play aunt's life. Morally, if someone is close and provides care, it's reasonable they receive the inheritance over distant relatives who weren't involved.\n\nThe husband's advice is to let the author decide. The author is conflicted because the relatives might contest, but they haven't approached the author directly. The author's annoyance is justified if they feel the relatives were neglectful. \n\nI should also consider if there's any obligation to share the inheritance. Generally, once it's legally yours, you aren't obligated to share unless there's a legal or moral obligation. Since the relatives were not close, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping it. The answer would be B, No.\n"
