When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relative. The author's actual aunt is the executor and informed them they were left the property and money. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't been around much. The author is considering keeping the inheritance, not giving anything to the relatives.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will was properly executed and the play aunt had the legal right to leave her assets to whomever she wanted, then the author has a legal claim. In many jurisdictions, you can leave your estate to anyone, regardless of family ties. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong if the will is valid.\n\nThen there's the moral or ethical aspect. The relatives weren't close, and the author's family took care of the play aunt. The author might feel they were fairly compensated through the bequest, especially since the relatives were distant. The husband's opinion supports the author's right to decide. The author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement is understandable given the lack of prior contact.\n\nHowever, some might argue that not considering the relatives could be seen as harsh, even if legally justified. But given the circumstances, the author's family contributed significantly, and the play aunt chose to reward them. The key points are the validity of the will and the prior relationship dynamics. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
