When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relation. The author and their actual aunt helped the play aunt with tasks like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn for years. The author didn't expect any payment for that. Now, the play aunt left her property and money to the author through her actual aunt, the executor. The play aunt's relatives are upset and considering contesting the will, but they haven't been around for years. The author is considering keeping the inheritance, as they were close and the relatives weren't involved.\n\nFirst, legally, if the will is valid and the author is named as a beneficiary, then they have the right to the inheritance. The relatives haven't approached the author directly, so maybe there's a misunderstanding or a valid claim they're considering. But since the author wasn't expecting any compensation for the help, it's more about the will's validity and the relatives' claims.\n\nMoral-wise, the author helped the play aunt a lot, and the play aunt clearly wanted to thank them by leaving her inheritance. The relatives were distant, and the play aunt spent more time with the author's family. The author might feel it's their right to accept the inheritance as per the will. The husband's advice to decide themselves also supports that.\n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or social expectation to share with distant relatives? However, the relatives weren't involved in her life, so expecting them to inherit might be unreasonable. The key points are the validity of the will, the closeness of the relationship, and the relatives' lack of involvement. If the will is legally sound and the author was a close friend, then the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
