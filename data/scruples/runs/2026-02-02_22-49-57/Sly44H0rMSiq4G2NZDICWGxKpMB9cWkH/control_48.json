When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by summarizing the scenario. \n\nSo, the author is talking about their \"play aunt,\" who isn't a blood relative. This play aunt was friends with their actual aunt. The author and their family helped take care of the play aunt by doing chores like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn because she was near their actual aunt's house. They didn't expect any payment for it. The play aunt passed away, and her actual relatives (blood relatives) aren't close. The author's actual aunt, who is the executor of the estate, told the author that the play aunt left her property and money to them. However, the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is annoyed because these relatives are involved now but weren't around for years. They consider giving family pictures but not the money or property. The husband says it's up to the author to decide. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they just take the inheritance as per the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if a will is valid and properly executed, the wishes of the testator (the person who made the will) should be followed unless there's a valid reason to contest it, like undue influence or lack of capacity. The play aunt's relatives are upset, but if they haven't successfully contested the will in court, the author has a legal right to the inheritance. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nEthically, this is trickier. The author's family helped care for the play aunt for years without expecting anything in return. The play aunt, being grateful, left them the inheritance. The relatives weren't involved in her care, yet they're now upset. The author might feel justified in taking the inheritance since they provided support over the years. However, some might argue that the relatives, being blood relations, might have an expectation of receiving the inheritance. But since they weren't involved in her life, the author could counter that their contributions were significant and recognized by the play aunt.\n\nAnother angle is the intent of the testator. The play aunt chose to leave her assets to the author's family, possibly as a gesture of gratitude. If the will is valid, the author is honoring her wishes by accepting it. The relatives contesting the will might not succeed if there's no legal basis, so the author isn't violating any ethical duty by not giving up the inheritance.\n\nThe author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement is understandable given their lack of presence in the play aunt's life. The author's husband's advice to decide for themselves also suggests that the decision is personal. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say the author should share the inheritance with the relatives out of fairness, but the author didn't owe them anything. The play aunt had the right to leave her assets to whomever she chose. The relatives not being part of her daily life might reduce their claim.\n\nIn conclusion, legally the author is not in the wrong as long as the will stands. Ethically, it's a close call but leans towards the author being justified in accepting the inheritance as a reward for their care. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
