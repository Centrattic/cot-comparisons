When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about inheriting from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't blood-related. The main points are that the person and their actual aunt helped the play aunt with chores because she lived nearby, and they didn't expect payment. Now, the actual aunt is the executor and says the play aunt left everything to them. The relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid and the play aunt clearly stated she wanted the person to inherit, then legally the person is in the right. The relatives contesting might not have grounds if the will is properly executed. But maybe there's a legal reason they could challenge it, like if she was of unsound mind or under duress. But the scenario doesn't mention that.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The person helped the play aunt for years without expecting anything. The relatives weren't around, so it's possible the play aunt felt they didn't deserve the inheritance. The author is annoyed that the relatives are now involved. The husband says it's up to them to decide if they want to give anything, but the question is about whether they're in the wrong if they don't.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if the play aunt made her wishes clear in the will, then obeying her wishes is respecting her autonomy. The relatives weren't part of her life, so it's reasonable she left it to someone who was there for her. However, if there's a cultural expectation or if the relatives have a legal claim that's being ignored, maybe there's a different angle. But the scenario doesn't suggest that.\n\nThe author's actions are based on the play aunt's wishes and their family's care for her. The relatives not being around could mean they didn't contribute to her well-being. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The key is whether the will is valid and if the author is upholding the deceased's intentions. Since the will is valid, the answer is probably B.\n"
