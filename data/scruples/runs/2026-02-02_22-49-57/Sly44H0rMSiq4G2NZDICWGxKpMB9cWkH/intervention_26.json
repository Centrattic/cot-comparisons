When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relation. The author helped take care of the aunt along with their actual aunt, and now the play aunt left them her property and money. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but the author feels justified in keeping the inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will was properly executed and the author is a named beneficiary, then legally they have a right to the inheritance. The relatives haven't taken legal action yet, so maybe there's no legal issue here. The executor, the actual aunt, supports the author keeping it, which adds weight to the legitimacy.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author helped care for the play aunt for years without expecting anything in return. The play aunt's relatives weren't around, so the author and their family were the ones providing support. The relatives aren't close, so the author might feel they deserve the inheritance more. The husband's opinion is that the author can decide, which suggests he supports her choice.\n\nThe key points are: the will's validity, the care provided by the author, the lack of involvement from the relatives, and the executor's endorsement. The author isn't legally obligated to give anything to the relatives unless there's a court challenge. Morally, it's about the intentions of the deceased and the circumstances of the beneficiaries.\n\nSince the play aunt chose to leave everything to the author and the relatives haven't proven any legal grounds to contest, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
