When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the WIBTA scenario) is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author helped an \"aunt\" (not blood related) over the years, doing chores like snow shoveling and yard work. The real aunt is the executor and informed the author that the play aunt left her property and money to them. The relatives of the play aunt are upset and might contest the will. The author is considering keeping it because the relatives weren't around much, and they did the work for years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will was properly executed and witnessed, the author is entitled to the inheritance unless there's a legal challenge. The relatives haven't gone to court yet, so legally, the author is in the right to take the inheritance as per the will.\n\nEthically, it's trickier. The author helped the aunt for years without expecting anything, but the aunt chose to reward them. The relatives weren't involved much, so maybe the author's contribution justifies keeping the inheritance. The question is whether the author is being selfish or justified in following the will's terms.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the relatives haven't been around, and the aunt spent time with them. The husband says it's up to them to decide if they want to give anything. The author isn't being mean for keeping it; they're following the will's instructions. The relatives' potential contest is their issue, not the author's.\n\nIn legal terms, unless there's a valid claim against the will, the author is within their rights. Ethically, since the author contributed to the play aunt's well-being, the inheritance might be seen as a recognition of that support. The key points are the validity of the will and the context of the author's contributions versus the relatives' lack of involvement.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because legally and ethically, the author has a valid claim based on the will and their actions.\n"
