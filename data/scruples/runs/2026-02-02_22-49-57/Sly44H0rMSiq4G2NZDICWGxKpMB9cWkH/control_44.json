When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong regarding accepting an inheritance. The key points are:\n\n1. The deceased is referred to as a \"play aunt,\" not a blood relative. The writer and their actual aunt helped this play aunt with chores over the years. They didn't expect payment, just doing it as a favor.\n\n2. The play aunt's actual relatives aren't close\u2014they didn't visit much and weren't close. The executor (the writer's actual aunt) informed the writer that the play aunt left the estate to them. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't approached the writer directly.\n\n3. The writer is conflicted. They feel justified in keeping the inheritance because the relatives were absent, and the play aunt spent time with them. The husband says it's up to the writer. The main question is whether the writer is an asshole for keeping the inheritance as per the will.\n\nFirst, legally, if the will is valid and the relatives haven't officially contested it, the writer has a right to the inheritance. The relatives not being close and not being involved in the play aunt's life recently might support the writer's stance. However, morally, there's a consideration of whether it's fair to the distant relatives, even if they weren't close. The writer might feel they contributed care, which the play aunt appreciated, hence the bequest as a token.\n\nThe relatives' potential contest is a legal issue, but the writer isn't in a position to know if they'll win. If the will is valid, the writer isn't obligated to give anything. The fact that they didn't expect compensation before might make the bequest a personal appreciation. So, the author isn't in the wrong if the will is valid. The answer is B.\n"
