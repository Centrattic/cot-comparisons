When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the scenario) is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the scenario. The author's \"play aunt\" isn't a blood relative. The author and their actual aunt took care of her by doing chores, which wasn't a huge extra effort. The play aunt left her estate to them, which includes a home, car, and life insurance. The play aunt's biological relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't close to her and haven't been around much. The author's actual aunt, who is the executor, supports keeping the inheritance, and the author's husband says it's up to them. The author is conflicted but feels justified in keeping it given their long-term care and the relatives' lack of involvement.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the author is named as the beneficiary, then they have a right to the inheritance. The relatives contesting might not have grounds if the will is properly executed. The author's actions were based on a long-term relationship of support, which the play aunt likely appreciated. The relatives' lack of involvement over the years is a key point; the play aunt spent more time with the author's family. The author isn't obligated to share unless there's a legal or moral obligation, which doesn't seem to be the case here. The husband's advice supports the author's autonomy in the decision.\n\nEthically, it's about whether the author's actions are morally right. Since they provided care and the play aunt expressed her wishes in the will, the author isn't in the wrong. The relatives' potential contest is their legal challenge, but that doesn't make the author at fault. The author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement is understandable given their history.\n\nSo, putting it all together: legally, the author has a right to the inheritance. Morally, considering the care provided and the relatives' lack of presence, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
