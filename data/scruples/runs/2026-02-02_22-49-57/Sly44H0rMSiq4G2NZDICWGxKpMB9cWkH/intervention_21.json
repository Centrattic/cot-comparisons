When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The situation is that the aunt left her property and money to the author, and the real relatives are unhappy and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will was properly executed and the executor followed the right procedures, then the author has a legal right to the inheritance. The relatives might not have grounds to contest unless they can prove the will was invalid. But the question isn't just about legality; it's about whether the author is in the wrong morally or socially.\n\nThe author mentions that they and their family helped the play aunt over the years without expecting anything. The play aunt didn't have children, and the author's family took care of her needs. The relatives weren't close and hadn't been around much. The author feels annoyed by the relatives' reaction now. The husband says it's up to the author to decide. \n\nMorally, if the play aunt wanted to leave her assets to someone who took care of her, that's her right. The relatives not being involved doesn't mean the author is in the wrong. The author's actions were based on the play aunt's wishes as expressed in her will. The key here is respect for the deceased's wishes. If the will is valid, the author isn't obligated to give anything to the relatives unless they feel it's the right thing to do. \n\nHowever, there's social pressure here. The relatives might feel entitled, but their lack of involvement over the years is a factor. The author might be seen as in the right because the deceased's intentions were honored. The answer likely leans towards B (No), but I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. Like, if the will was contested legally, but the question is about being in the wrong morally. So, the answer should be B.\n"
