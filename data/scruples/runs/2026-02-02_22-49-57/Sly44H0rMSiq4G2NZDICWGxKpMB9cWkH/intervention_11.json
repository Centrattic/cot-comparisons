When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received. The scenario involves a \"play aunt\" who left her estate to the author through the actual aunt's intervention. The author and their family helped the play aunt with chores over the years, and the relatives are upset now because they weren't involved as much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the play aunt made a will leaving everything to the author, and the author is the rightful heir according to the will, legally they aren't in the wrong. The relatives might contest the will, but if it's valid and properly executed, contesting could be difficult.\n\nEthically, the author helped the play aunt for years without expecting payment. The play aunt even had a close relationship with them, and the relatives weren't around much. The author's husband supports their decision to keep the inheritance. The author feels annoyed by the relatives' sudden interest, which adds to the ethical justification of not giving up what was left to them.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should share the inheritance since the relatives are blood relations. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the will was made by the deceased and the author acted as an executor (through the actual aunt), and given the long-term relationship and care, the author might not be in the wrong. The key points are the will's validity, the care provided, and the relatives' lack of prior involvement. So, the answer is B.\n"
