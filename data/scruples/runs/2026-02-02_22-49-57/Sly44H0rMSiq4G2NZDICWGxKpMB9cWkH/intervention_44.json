When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nSo, the author is referred to as \"Play Aunt,\" but she's not a blood relative. The author's actual aunt is the executor of the estate. The Play Aunt had been receiving help from the author and their family for years, like shoveling snow and cutting grass, which wasn't too much extra work. The Play Aunt was nice to the author as a kid and helped with their kids' college letters. The author didn't expect compensation for that help. Now, the Play Aunt left her property and money to the author. The real aunt says to keep everything, but the Play Aunt's relatives are unhappy and might contest the will. The author feels annoyed that the relatives are involved, since they weren't around much. The husband says it's up to the author to decide. The author is conflicted about keeping the inheritance or giving some of it to the relatives.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by keeping the inheritance. The user thinks the author isn't at fault, but wants confirmation. \n\nFirst, legally, if the will is valid and the author is named as the beneficiary, then they have a right to the inheritance. The relatives wanting to contest the will would have to go through legal channels. Unless there's evidence of undue influence or the will being improperly executed, the author is within their rights to keep it. \n\nMoral considerations: The author and their family helped the Play Aunt for years, and she seemed to appreciate them. The relatives weren't around, so maybe the Play Aunt felt closer to the author's family. The author isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless they feel ethically bound. However, if the relatives can prove the Play Aunt intended to leave them something, there might be a case, but the author isn't in the wrong unless there's a legal issue. \n\nEmotionally, the author is annoyed that the relatives are involved, which adds to the complexity. The author might feel it's unfair after all their help. The husband's stance is supportive. \n\nIn summary, legally and morally, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The key points are the validity of the will, the intentions of the Play Aunt, and the effort the author put in. If the will is valid, the author is justified in keeping the inheritance. The relatives' potential contest is a separate issue. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
