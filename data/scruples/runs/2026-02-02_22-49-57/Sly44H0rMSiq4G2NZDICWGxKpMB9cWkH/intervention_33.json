When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author received an inheritance from a \"play aunt,\" who wasn't a blood relative. The author and their actual aunt helped take care of the play aunt by doing chores for her, like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn. The play aunt left her property and money to the author, and the author's actual aunt, who is the executor, is telling them to keep everything. However, the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they feel they didn't expect any compensation for the help they provided, but they also don't want to give the inheritance to the distant relatives who weren't around much. The husband says it's up to the author to decide, and the author is wondering if they're an asshole for just following the play aunt's wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. If the will was properly executed and the play aunt had the legal right to leave her assets to the author, then the author is within their rights to keep the inheritance. Since the relatives are considering contesting the will, the author should check if the will is valid. If the will is valid, then the author isn't in the wrong legally.\n\nEthically, the author might feel conflicted. The relatives might argue that the play aunt didn't properly consider them, but the author and their family were actively taking care of her. The play aunt's actions during her life (like being helpful to the author's kids) might support the argument that the author was a close and caring figure. The fact that the relatives weren't around much could weigh in the author's favor ethically, as the play aunt chose to spend time with the author's family.\n\nAlso, the author didn't expect any compensation for the chores, which were minimal extra work. So the inheritance might be a gesture of gratitude rather than a payment. The author isn't taking advantage but accepting a gift the deceased intended for them.\n\nHowever, there's the aspect of family dynamics. The relatives might feel slighted, even if they weren't close. But the author's actions are in line with the deceased's wishes, so ethically, they're respecting the play aunt's final wishes. \n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" the author isn't doing anything malicious. They're following the will's instructions and haven't ignored the relatives' feelings, but they're choosing to honor the deceased's decision. The key point is that the author isn't obligated to give the inheritance to the relatives unless the will is invalid. Since the author is not acting out of greed but in accordance with the play aunt's desires, they're probably not in the wrong.\n"
