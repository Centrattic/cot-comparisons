When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from the \"play aunt.\" The play aunt wasn't a blood relative but was close to the author and their actual aunt. The author and their family helped take care of the play aunt by doing chores like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn. The play aunt left her estate to the author, and the relatives are upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will was properly executed and the author is the named beneficiary, then legally, they have a right to the inheritance. The relatives might contest the will, but unless there's a legal reason to invalidate it, the author isn't doing anything wrong.\n\nEthically, the situation is a bit more nuanced. The author helped the play aunt out, and the play aunt clearly valued them by leaving her estate to them. The author didn't expect compensation for the chores but was still given the inheritance. The relatives weren't involved much, so it's possible the play aunt intended for them to not get anything. However, the author might feel conflicted because the relatives are upset. But the play aunt's wishes should take precedence, especially if she had the legal right to do so.\n\nThe husband's advice that it's up to the author to decide is important. The author isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless there's a legal requirement. Since the play aunt's will is the main document, the author isn't in the wrong for following her wishes. The relatives' potential contest might not hold up legally, so the author is justified in keeping the inheritance.\n"
