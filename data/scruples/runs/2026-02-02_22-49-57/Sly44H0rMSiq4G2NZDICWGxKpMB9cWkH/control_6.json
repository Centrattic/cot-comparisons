When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the WIBTA question) is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance from the \"play aunt.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The play aunt isn't a blood relative but was friends with the user's actual aunt. They did chores for both aunts, which wasn't too much work. The play aunt left her property and money to the user, and her relatives are upset, considering contesting the will. The user is considering keeping it, and their husband says it's up to them. The user is conflicted because the relatives weren't around much, but they might be challenging the will.\n\nSo, the key points here are the validity of the will, the intentions of the play aunt, and the ethical considerations. The user was not expecting compensation for helping, and the play aunt had a close relationship with them. The relatives are distant and haven't been involved. \n\nLegally, if the will is valid (which we don't know), the author has a right to the inheritance. Ethically, since the play aunt was closer to the user and the relatives were neglectful, the user might have a good case for keeping it. The relatives' potential contest might depend on their legal standing and the will's validity. But the user isn't in the wrong if they follow the will's terms. However, if the will is contested and found invalid, then the distribution might change. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong now. Since the play aunt's wishes are clear (as per the will, and the relatives weren't involved), the author isn't in the wrong for following those wishes. The answer would be B, No.\n"
