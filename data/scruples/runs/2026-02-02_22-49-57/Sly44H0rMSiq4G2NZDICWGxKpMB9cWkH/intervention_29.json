When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author, referred to as \"I\" in the scenario, is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance from the \"play aunt.\" \n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: The author and their actual aunt took care of the play aunt for years, doing chores like shoveling snow and cutting grass. They didn't expect payment because of their relationship and the play aunt's kindness. The play aunt's relatives, who weren't close, are upset about the inheritance and might contest the will. The author's own aunt (executor) says to keep everything, and the husband thinks it's up to the author's decision.\n\nSo, the main issues here are legal and ethical. Legally, if the will is valid and the play aunt explicitly left everything to the author, then the author is within their rights to keep it. The relatives haven't actually taken legal action yet, just talking about contesting. Unless the will was signed under duress or is invalid, the author is protected.\n\nEthically, the author might feel conflicted because they're not blood relatives, but the play aunt chose them as the beneficiary. The care provided wasn't for payment, which might have been a mutual understanding. The author also mentions that the relatives weren't around, so the play aunt's choice reflects her actual relationships. \n\nThe relatives' dissatisfaction is a common issue in inheritances, especially when non-blood relatives benefit. But the author isn't obligated to give up what was legally left to them. The husband's advice supports that it's up to the author. \n\nPotential arguments against the author: Maybe the play aunt didn't fully understand what she was doing, or there was some expectation of reciprocity. However, the scenario doesn't mention any such factors. It seems the play aunt made a deliberate choice.\n\nIn conclusion, legally and ethically, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the wishes of the deceased as expressed in the will, and the relatives haven't proven any illegality. The author's annoyance is understandable, but not a reason to be in the wrong.\n"
