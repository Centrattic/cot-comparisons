When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance left to them by their \"play aunt.\" The scenario involves a non-blood relative, referred to as a \"play aunt,\" who left her estate to the author. The author's actual aunt, who is the executor, informed them about the inheritance. The play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't been close to her for years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most jurisdictions, if a will is valid and properly executed, the testator's wishes are followed unless there's a legal reason to contest it. The relatives mentioned might have a case if they were dependents or if there was lack of mental capacity, undue influence, or forgery. However, the author states that the relatives weren't close and didn't visit much. So, legally, the author might be in the right to keep the inheritance as per the will.\n\nNext, the moral aspect. The author and their family provided care and assistance over the years, which the play aunt appreciated. The author didn't expect compensation but felt it was a mutual arrangement. The relatives' annoyance seems to stem from not being close, which the author feels justifies keeping the inheritance. The husband's opinion supports the author's right to decide, which adds to the moral justification.\n\nAlso, the author's annoyance at the relatives' sudden interest posthumously is understandable. The play aunt spent her holidays with the author's family, indicating her preference in life, which should carry weight in how her estate is handled.\n\nHowever, there's a possibility that the relatives could legally challenge the will. If they do, the author might need to defend the will's validity. But unless there's evidence of wrongdoing in the will's creation, the author is likely protected.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted according to the play aunt's wishes as expressed in her will. The lack of prior involvement from the relatives and the care provided by the author's family support the author's decision. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
