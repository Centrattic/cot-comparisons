When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance from their \"play aunt.\" The situation involves a non-blood relative who left her estate to the author through the executor, their actual aunt. The play aunt's relatives are upset and considering contesting the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since the play aunt's will was properly executed and the executor (the actual aunt) is handling it, unless the relatives can prove the will was invalid, the author is legally entitled to the inheritance. The relatives' potential contest isn't a strong indicator of illegality unless there's evidence of undue influence or lack of capacity.\n\nEthically, the author provided care and support to the play aunt over the years without expecting compensation. The aunt was close to them and chose to leave the inheritance as a gesture of gratitude. The relatives haven't been involved, so there's a moral argument that the author was the one maintaining a relationship and helping out. \n\nThe author feels annoyed that the relatives are now involved after years of absence. The husband advises it's their decision. The key here is whether the author is obligated to share the inheritance. Since the play aunt explicitly willed everything to the author, the author isn't in the wrong for following the will's terms. The relatives' possible contest is speculative and not confirmed. \n\nAlso, the author didn't expect compensation for their help, which was a voluntary act. Accepting the inheritance is a form of acknowledgment for the support provided. There's no indication of fraud or coercion. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping the inheritance as per the will. The answer is B.\n"
