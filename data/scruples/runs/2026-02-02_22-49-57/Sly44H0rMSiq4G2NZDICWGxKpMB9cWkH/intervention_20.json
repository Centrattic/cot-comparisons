When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be A Total Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The play aunt isn't a blood relative but was close to the author's actual aunt. The author and their family helped take care of the play aunt for years, doing chores and such. The play aunt left her estate to the author, and her relatives are upset and considering contesting the will.\n\nThe key points here are:\n\n1. **Intent of the Play Aunt**: The author believes that the play aunt intended for them to receive the inheritance as a thank you for their care and support over the years. The relatives aren't close and weren't involved in her daily life, so the play aunt might have felt more connected to the author and their family.\n\n2. **Legal vs. Moral Rights**: Legally, the will is the final authority. If the will is valid and the relatives aren't challenging it successfully, the author is entitled to the inheritance. Morally, the question is whether keeping the inheritance is fair, considering the relatives' potential feelings. However, since the relatives weren't involved in her life, the author might feel their input isn't as valid.\n\n3. **Past Actions**: The author didn't expect compensation for their help, which shows they were acting out of kindness. Now, the relatives are objecting after not being present. The author is justified in feeling annoyed that they're being dragged into this after years of absence.\n\n4. **Spousal Support**: The author's husband says the decision is up to them. This suggests that the author isn't being pressured and can make a choice based on their conscience.\n\n5. **Contesting the Will**: If the relatives contest the will, the author might have to go through legal processes, but unless the will is invalid, their claim is legal. The relatives' unhappiness doesn't override the legal document.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They were part of the play aunt's life, provided care, and the will reflects her wishes. The relatives' objections don't hold weight if the will is valid. The author isn't obligated to give them anything unless they choose to, and their annoyance is justified due to the relatives' absence during the play aunt's lifetime.\n"
