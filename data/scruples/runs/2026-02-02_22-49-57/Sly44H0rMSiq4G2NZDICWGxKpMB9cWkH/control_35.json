When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relative. The author helped care for her along with their actual aunt by doing chores, and in return, the play aunt left her estate to the author. The relatives of the play aunt are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't been involved much. The author is considering keeping the inheritance and feels annoyed by the relatives' involvement now.\n\nFirst, legally, if the will was properly executed and the executor (the author's actual aunt) is handling things correctly, then the author is entitled to the inheritance. The question is more about moral or ethical wrongdoing rather than legal. The author didn't expect compensation for the help they provided, which is a key point. They did the chores out of kindness and reciprocity, not for money. The play aunt's relatives aren't close and hadn't been involved, so the author might feel justified in keeping what was left by the deceased.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the relatives should be acknowledged or given a share, but the author's husband says it's up to them. The author's annoyance at the relatives' sudden interest after years of absence is understandable. Since the will was made by the deceased, respecting her wishes is important. Unless there's evidence the will was improperly made or the relatives have a legitimate legal claim, the author isn't in the wrong. They're honoring the play aunt's wishes as per her will, and the relatives' potential contest is their own issue. So, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
