When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt,\" who isn't a blood relative. The writer, along with their actual aunt, took care of the play aunt by doing chores for her, and now they've inherited her property and money. The play aunt's relatives are upset and considering contesting the will, but they weren't close to her. The writer's own aunt is the executor and says they should keep everything, but the writer is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid and properly executed, then the relatives contesting it would have to prove that the will was not made properly, like under undue influence or not of sound mind. Since the relatives haven't approached the writer directly, maybe they just mentioned it to the executor. The writer isn't legally obligated to give anything back unless the will is successfully contested and overturned.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The writer's family provided care for the play aunt, and she left them the inheritance. The relatives weren't around much, so maybe the play aunt felt the care they received was more deserving of the inheritance. The writer's husband supports their decision, so they might feel justified. However, the relatives are family, even if distant, and there's a sense of obligation or expectation sometimes in inheritances.\n\nBut the key points here: the play aunt's wishes were clear in the will. The relatives haven't made a formal claim or provided evidence that the will is invalid. The writer isn't the one making the will; they're just the beneficiary. The care provided by the writer's family was a mutual arrangement over years, and the play aunt appreciated their help. So, from a legal standpoint, the writer is within their rights to keep the inheritance as per the will. Morally, it's about respecting the play aunt's wishes and the care provided versus the relatives' claims. Since the relatives haven't taken legal action, the writer isn't in the wrong for following the will. The answer should be B (No).\n"
