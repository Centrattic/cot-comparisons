When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The situation is that the play aunt, who wasn't a blood relative, left her property and money to the author. The author's actual aunt, who is the executor, says they should keep it, but the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is annoyed because these relatives weren't around much, and the play aunt spent more time with them. The husband says it's up to the author.\n\nFirst, legally, if the will is valid, the author has every right to keep the inheritance. The relatives haven't formally contested it, just talked about it. So legally, no issue. The author isn't obligated to give anything away unless the will is successfully contested. \n\nMoral-wise, the author did a lot of favors for the play aunt without expecting anything. The play aunt left the inheritance as a gesture of gratitude, maybe. The relatives weren't involved, so the author's annoyance is understandable. The husband's advice to decide for themselves makes sense. \n\nThe key points are: the will's validity, the relatives' lack of prior involvement, and the author's own contributions. Since the author wasn't expecting compensation and the play aunt chose to leave it to them, it's justified. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
