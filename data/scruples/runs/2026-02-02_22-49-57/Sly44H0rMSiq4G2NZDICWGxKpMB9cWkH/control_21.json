When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The situation is that the play aunt, who wasn't related by blood, left her property and money to the author through her will. The actual aunt is the executor and thinks the author should keep it. However, the play aunt's relatives are upset because they weren't close to her and now want to contest the will. The author feels annoyed because these relatives are only showing up now and she's considering keeping the inheritance, especially since she and her family helped care for the play aunt over the years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid and properly executed, the author has a legal right to the inheritance. The relatives contesting the will would need to prove that the will is invalid, perhaps due to undue influence, lack of mental capacity, or not following proper legal formalities. If the will is valid, the author isn't in the wrong legally. \n\nThen there's the moral or ethical angle. The author helped care for the play aunt, which might be seen as a reason the aunt left her the inheritance. The relatives weren't around for years, so their absence could argue against their claim to the inheritance. The author's husband supports her decision, which suggests that within her family, there's no pressure to give it up. \n\nThe key points here are: the will's validity, the care provided by the author and her family, and the relatives' lack of involvement. If the will is legitimate, then the author isn't in the wrong for taking it. The fact that the relatives are contesting might be based on their own feelings of entitlement rather than any actual contribution. The author's annoyance at their involvement now, especially since they weren't around, adds to the argument that she's justified in keeping the inheritance. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B), as long as the will is valid and the relatives have no legal grounds to contest it. The ethical stance here leans towards supporting the author since she and her family were present and helpful when the relatives weren't.\n"
