When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance from their \"play aunt.\" So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe play aunt isn't a blood relative, but they were close. The author and their actual aunt helped her with chores over the years, which wasn't a big hassle. The play aunt left her property and money to the author via her actual aunt, who's the executor. The relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is considering keeping everything, feeling annoyed that the relatives are involved now, and the husband says it's up to them.\n\nHmm. Legally, if the will is valid, the author has a right to the inheritance. The relatives might contest it, but the question is about moral wrongdoing, not legal issues. Was the author expecting anything? They mention they didn't expect compensation because the play aunt was nice to them and helped. So they helped out of kindness, not for money. The play aunt's relatives weren't around, so maybe she felt more connected to the author's family.\n\nThe author is being asked if they're an \"asshole\" for keeping the inheritance. The key points are: the author wasn't expecting it, the play aunt left it to them, the relatives weren't involved much. The author might feel they deserve it since they provided care. Culturally, when someone leaves a gift, unless there's a legal challenge, the recipient isn't in the wrong for accepting. The relatives contesting is their issue, but the author isn't obligated to give it up unless they made a promise or there's a legal problem. Since the author isn't doing anything illegal and there's no prior agreement to share, they're probably not in the wrong.\n\nI think the answer is B. They're not in the wrong. They helped out of kindness, didn't expect money, and the play aunt's wishes should be respected unless there's a legal reason to doubt the will. The relatives' potential contest is their problem, not the author's moral fault.\n"
