When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they were left by a \"play aunt.\" The key points here are the relationship between the individuals, the context of the inheritance, and the potential legal and moral implications.\n\nFirst, the play aunt wasn't a blood relative but was close to the author's actual aunt. The author and their family helped care for the play aunt over the years, which the author didn't expect to be compensated for. The play aunt left her estate, including her home and car, to the author. Now, the play aunt's real relatives, who weren't close to her, are upset and considering contesting the will.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they feel the real relatives didn't contribute to care for the play aunt and weren't around, yet they want a share of the inheritance. The author's husband says it's up to them to decide.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the will is valid and the play aunt intended to leave everything to the author, then the author is entitled to it. However, if the relatives can contest the will successfully, maybe there's a legal challenge. But the relatives haven't approached the author directly, which might indicate they're not serious or don't know about the inheritance yet.\n\nMorally, the author has a history of helping the play aunt, who in turn provided support to the author's family. The relatives didn't contribute to her care, so the author might feel justified in keeping the inheritance. But there's also the aspect of being fair. Even if the law allows them to keep it, should they consider giving the relatives something out of goodwill?\n\nThe author's annoyance is understandable, especially since the relatives weren't around. The author's husband supports their decision, which suggests they should go with their gut. The main question is whether keeping the inheritance makes them an asshole. Since the play aunt's wishes were clear and the relatives didn't contribute, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're honoring the play aunt's wishes and the family's history of support. The answer is likely B.\n"
