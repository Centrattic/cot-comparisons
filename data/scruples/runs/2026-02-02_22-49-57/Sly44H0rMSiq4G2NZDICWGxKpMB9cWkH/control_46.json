When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Alright, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from a \"play aunt.\" The situation involves the author's actual aunt, who's the executor, and some distant relatives of the deceased play aunt who are upset about the inheritance.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the legal and emotional aspects. Legally, if the will is valid and the relatives aren't contesting it successfully, the author is within their rights to keep the inheritance. The play aunt left everything to the author, so unless there's a legal challenge that's upheld, there's no wrongdoing.\n\nEmotionally and socially, the author might feel conflicted. They mention that the relatives weren't close, and the play aunt spent more time with their family. The author also helped out with chores, which didn't expect compensation. The relatives' annoyance might stem from feeling overlooked, but they weren't involved in the care of the play aunt either.\n\nThe husband's advice suggests the decision is up to the author. The author's reasoning is that the relatives didn't contribute or visit, so they're not in the wrong for keeping the inheritance. The main factors here are the validity of the will, the relatives' lack of involvement, and the author's prior relationship with the play aunt.\n\nConsidering all that, unless there's a legal issue with the will, the author isn't in the wrong. The relatives' potential contesting the will doesn't change the author's right if the will is valid. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
