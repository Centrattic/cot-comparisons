When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from their play aunt. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the play aunt wasn't a blood relative. The author and their actual aunt helped the play aunt with tasks like shoveling snow and cutting grass. The author didn't expect any payment for this help because the play aunt was nice to them and their kids. The play aunt had relatives but they weren't close. Now, after her death, the actual aunt (as executor) told the author they inherited the play aunt's property and money. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't approached the author directly. The author is annoyed by this and is considering keeping everything, as per the will. Their husband says it's their decision.\n\nThe key points here are the relationship, the will's validity, and whether the author has any obligation to the relatives. Since the will was made by the play aunt and the author is the beneficiary, unless the relatives can prove the will is invalid (like undue influence, lack of capacity, etc.), the author is legally entitled to the inheritance. The fact that the relatives weren't close and didn't take care of her as the author's family did might also be a moral point in the author's favor. The relatives not contesting through proper channels might mean they can't. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong if the will stands. Morally, it's a gray area because the relatives might feel wronged, but the author's family did the care work. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
