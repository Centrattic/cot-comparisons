When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who left her property and money to the author. The key points here are the relationship with the play aunt, the help provided over the years, and the relatives' potential contesting the will.\n\nFirst, the author helped the play aunt and their actual aunt for years without expecting compensation. They didn't do it as a favor for the play aunt's relatives, since those relatives weren't around much. The play aunt's will leaves everything to the author, and the real aunt is the executor. The relatives are upset and might contest, but they haven't approached the author directly.\n\nThe author is conflicted but leans towards keeping the inheritance because they provided care and the relatives weren't involved. The husband says it's up to them. The question is whether they're in the wrong by accepting the inheritance as per the will.\n\nLegal standpoint: If the will is valid and the relatives haven't successfully contested it, the author has a right to the inheritance. The play aunt had the legal right to bequeath her assets as she wished, regardless of family ties. Since the relatives haven't approached the author, the author isn't directly interacting with them, which might reduce their moral obligation.\n\nMoral standpoint: The author provided significant care and support. The play aunt clearly valued them, so leaving her assets to the author makes sense. The relatives not being involved during her life might mean they don't have a strong moral claim. The author isn't obligated to share unless they feel a personal responsibility, which they don't seem to.\n\nPotential issues: If the relatives do contest the will, there could be legal challenges, but the author's position would still be protected if the will is valid. The author's annoyance is understandable given the relatives' lack of presence.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the play aunt's wishes, and the relatives' dissatisfaction doesn't negate that. The answer should be B.\n"
