When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe key points here are: The person and their actual aunt took care of the \"play aunt\" by helping with chores. The play aunt wasn't blood-related. They didn't expect any payment but were left her property and money. The relatives of the play aunt are upset and might contest the will. The person is considering keeping the inheritance, and their husband says it's their decision. The question is whether the author (the person in the scenario) is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main factors to consider are the relationship between the people involved, the expectations of the play aunt, and the legal standing of the inheritance. Since the play aunt explicitly left her estate to the author through her will, and she was the executor (her actual aunt), the author is legally entitled to it. The relatives not being close and not taking care of her might support the play aunt's decision to leave the inheritance to someone who was present in her life.\n\nHowever, there's a social aspect. If the relatives contest the will, the author might face legal challenges. But the question is about moral wrong, not legal. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong morally. Since the play aunt had the right to decide who inherits her property, and the author and their family provided care, the author might not be in the wrong. The fact that the relatives weren't involved suggests the play aunt's choice was based on who was supportive during her life.\n\nAnother angle: the author isn't being greedy; they didn't expect the inheritance. They might feel entitled to it because of their longstanding support. The husband's support in the decision also plays a role. The answer might hinge on whether the play aunt's intentions are respected versus the expectations of distant relatives.\n\nIn legal terms, if the will is valid, the author is okay. Morally, it's about whether the play aunt made a fair decision. Since the author and their family were there, it's reasonable. The relatives' possible contesting might be seen as a legal issue, not a moral one against the author. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
