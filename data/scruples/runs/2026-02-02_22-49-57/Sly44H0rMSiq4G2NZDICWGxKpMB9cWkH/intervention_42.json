When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance from the \"play aunt.\" The situation involves the author receiving property and money from someone they weren't related to, but who they helped care for along with their actual aunt. The key points are that the author and their aunt did some chores for the play aunt over the years, and now the play aunt left everything to the author. The relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the will is valid and the author is a beneficiary, they have the right to the inheritance. The question is about whether it's morally right to take it, considering the extended family's possible contestation. The author argues they didn't expect compensation for the help, which was part of a mutual arrangement. They also mention that the relatives weren't close to the play aunt.\n\nEthically, there's a gray area. The author provided help without expecting payment, but accepting a gift from someone they were close to might be seen as fair. However, the relatives' reaction adds complexity. The author's husband says it's up to them, which suggests it's a personal decision. The user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nI should consider factors like intent, the relationship dynamics, and fairness. The author's actions were based on a long-term, informal agreement to help the play aunt, not a legal contract. The fact that the play aunt left the inheritance to the author could indicate her intent, despite the relatives' dissatisfaction. If the relatives contest the will, the author might need to defend the will's validity, but if it's not contested or is upheld, the author is within their rights to keep it.\n\nMoral judgment might depend on whether the author had prior expectations of receiving something. The author says they didn't expect compensation, which could support their stance. Also, the relatives not being close might reduce their claim. However, some might argue that the author should share the inheritance since the will might not be legally sound if the relatives contest it. But if the will is valid, the author isn't in the wrong for following the deceased's wishes.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They acted based on the play aunt's wishes and the existing relationship, even if the relatives are unhappy. Unless the will is successfully contested, the author has the right to the inheritance.\n"
