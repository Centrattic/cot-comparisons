When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who isn't a blood relative. The key points are:\n\n1. The aunt did chores for both their actual aunt and the play aunt over the years. It wasn't much work, and they didn't expect payment.\n2. The play aunt left her property and money to the author. The actual aunt (executor) wants the author to keep it, but the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n3. The author is annoyed because the relatives weren't close, and the play aunt spent time with them more often. The husband says it's up to the author whether to give the relatives anything.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance. \n\nFirst, legally, if the will is valid and the author is a beneficiary, they have a right to the inheritance. The relatives' threat to contest might not hold up if they weren't close and the will is properly executed. The author didn't expect anything when helping, so there's no prior agreement about compensation.\n\nEthically, the author helped with the understanding that it was a favor, not a transaction. The relatives were absent, so the play aunt's choice to leave it to the author might be seen as a reward for their support. The author isn't obligated to redistribute the inheritance unless there's a legal challenge. \n\nThe husband's advice supports the author's autonomy. The author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement makes sense given their lack of presence in the play aunt's life. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're following the play aunt's wishes, and there's no legal or moral obligation to give the inheritance to the relatives. The answer should be B.\n"
