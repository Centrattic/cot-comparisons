When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance from their \"play aunt.\" So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe key points are: the author and their actual aunt helped the play aunt with tasks like snow shoveling and yard work over the years. They didn't expect payment because the play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped the author's kids. Now, the play aunt left her property and money to the author through the actual aunt, who is the executor. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't been close to the play aunt for years. The author is annoyed and doesn't want to give up the inheritance. Their husband says it's up to them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong to take the inheritance as per the will.\n\nFirst, legally, if the will is valid, the author is entitled to the inheritance. The play aunt clearly stated her wishes, and the executor (the actual aunt) confirmed it. The relatives haven't legally contested it yet, just expressed intentions. So legally, the author is on solid ground.\n\nMoral or ethical standpoint: The author provided help over the years without expecting payment. The play aunt reciprocated by leaving her assets to them. The relatives weren't involved in her daily life, so their claim might be weaker. The author's annoyance is justified since they had a close relationship and contributed to the play aunt's well-being. The author isn't obligated to share unless there's a legal contest, which hasn't materialized. The relatives' potential contest is speculative. The author's husband's advice to decide for themselves supports the author's autonomy.\n\nPossible counterpoints: Some might argue that the author should consider the relatives' feelings, but given their lack of involvement, that seems less valid. The author's contribution to the play aunt's life makes the bequest more justified. Also, the actual aunt, as executor, is advising the author to keep it, which adds weight to the legitimacy.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're respecting the play aunt's wishes and have a valid claim to the inheritance. The relatives might challenge it, but legally, the author is in the right. Ethically, their actions align with the play aunt's expressed gratitude and their own long-term support.\n"
