When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The scenario involves the aunt being close to the author's family, and the author and their family helping her with chores over the years. The actual aunt is the executor and told the author they should keep everything, but the relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will was properly executed and the relatives weren't included in the will, they might not have a legal standing to contest it unless they can prove undue influence or other legal grounds. The author isn't legally obligated to give them anything if the will is valid.\n\nThen, there's the moral angle. The author didn't expect compensation for helping the play aunt, so accepting the inheritance as per her will isn't necessarily wrong. The play aunt had the right to choose who she wanted to leave her assets to, especially if she wasn't close to her relatives. The fact that the relatives weren't involved in her life might support the author's stance.\n\nThe author's husband's advice that it's up to them also suggests that the decision is personal. The author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement now that there's an inheritance to be had is understandable given their lack of prior presence.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
