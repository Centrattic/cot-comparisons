When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received. The situation involves a \"play aunt,\" not a blood relative, who left her estate to the author's actual aunt, who then passed it on to the author. The key points here are the relationship between the individuals, the circumstances under which the author helped the play aunt, and the reactions of the play aunt's relatives.\n\nFirst, the author helped the play aunt with tasks like shoveling snow and cutting grass. It's mentioned that this wasn't much extra work since they were nearby, and the author didn't expect compensation. The play aunt was also nice to them as a kid and helped their children. The actual aunt, who is the executor, decided to pass on the inheritance, which the play aunt's relatives are unhappy about. The author is conflicted and considering keeping the inheritance, leading to the question of whether they're an asshole for doing so.\n\nThe main ethical considerations here are the intentions of the play aunt, the fairness of the inheritance distribution, and the obligations the author might have to the relatives. Since the play aunt explicitly left her estate to the actual aunt, who then passed it to the author, the author isn't directly responsible for the will's content. The relatives are contesting the will, but the author wasn't involved in the will's creation. The author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement is understandable given their lack of prior engagement with the play aunt.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by keeping what's left to them while the relatives contest the will. Legally, if the will is valid, the author has a right to the inheritance. Morally, the author might feel conflicted, especially since the relatives are upset. However, the author's actions were based on the play aunt's wishes and the help provided over the years. There's no indication that the author acted with malice or that the will is invalid. The relatives have their own legal recourse if they believe the will was not properly executed or if there's undue influence, but that's separate from the author's decision to accept the inheritance.\n\nThe husband's input that it's up to the author to decide suggests that there's no obligation to give up the inheritance unless the author chooses to do so. The author isn't in the wrong because they're following the deceased's wishes and aren't responsible for the relatives' dissatisfaction. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
