When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The scenario involves the aunt leaving her property and money to the author, which is causing some tension with her actual relatives.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The will was created by the deceased, and the author is the beneficiary. If the will is valid and executed properly, the author has a legal right to the inheritance. The relatives are considering contesting the will, but unless there's a legal issue with the will's validity (like undue influence, fraud, or lack of mental capacity), the author isn't in the wrong legally.\n\nNext, the moral side. The author mentions that they didn't expect compensation for helping the play aunt and their aunt over the years. They had a close relationship, and the play aunt was helpful to the author's children. The relatives weren't close, didn't visit much, and weren't around. The author's husband supports their decision to keep the inheritance. Morally, if the deceased intended to leave the inheritance to the author, then following her wishes is respectful. The annoyance the author feels towards the relatives is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nAnother angle: the relatives are upset but haven't approached the author directly. The author isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless there's a legal challenge. If the will is valid, the author isn't in the wrong for accepting what was left to them. They might choose to share out of kindness, but that's a personal choice, not a legal or moral obligation.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that since the relatives are blood relations, they should inherit by default. However, the deceased had the right to leave her estate to anyone she chose. The fact that the relatives weren't close and didn't contribute to her care might support the author's position.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. Legally, they have the right to the inheritance as per the will. Morally, respecting the deceased's wishes and the close relationship they had with the play aunt supports the author's decision.\n"
