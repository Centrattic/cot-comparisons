When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The aunt in question wasn't related by blood but had a close relationship with the person's actual aunt. The two aunts were friends, and the person helped care for the play aunt over the years. Now, the play aunt left her property and money to them, and the relatives are upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The will is the key here. If the play aunt legally wrote a will that leaves everything to the author, then legally, the author has the right to keep it. The relatives contesting the will would need valid legal grounds, like proving the will was invalid (undue influence, lack of mental capacity, etc.). Since the author mentions the relatives haven't been close and haven't visited much, maybe the will is valid, making the author not legally at fault.\n\nNext, the moral side. The author helped care for the play aunt for years, and she was nice to them as a child and helped their kids. The play aunt spent most holidays with them, which suggests a close bond. The relatives were distant and not involved in her life. The author's husband supports their decision. Morally, it could be seen that the play aunt had the right to choose her beneficiary, especially since she had a better relationship with the author and their family.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the relatives should be considered. But the key point is that the will is in place, and the author didn't know about the relatives' potential contest. The author isn't obligated to give up the inheritance unless legally required. They also offered to share family pictures, showing some gesture of goodwill, but keeping the assets aligns with the deceased's wishes.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. The will's validity is the main factor, and the author is following the play aunt's wishes, which were influenced by her closer relationship with them. The relatives' dissatisfaction doesn't override the legal and moral justification here.\n"
