When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The setup is that the author, along with their actual aunt, helped take care of the play aunt over the years by doing chores like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn. They didn't expect anything in return, but the play aunt left her estate to the author. Now, the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is considering keeping the inheritance and is asking if they're an asshole for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The will was executed properly, and the actual aunt is the executor. If the will is valid, then the author is legally entitled to the inheritance. The relatives might contest it, but unless there's something legally wrong with the will (like undue influence or lack of mental capacity), the author isn't breaking any laws by keeping it. So legally, the author is fine.\n\nMoral or ethical considerations are trickier. The author helped care for the play aunt, which might have influenced the will. The play aunt's relatives did visit occasionally but weren't close. The author feels justified in keeping the inheritance because of the care provided. The relatives haven't been involved in the care, so maybe they don't have a strong moral claim. However, some might argue that the author should consider the family's wishes or share the inheritance to avoid conflict. \n\nThe author's husband says it's up to them to decide, which suggests he doesn't see a problem. The author also mentions that the relatives haven't been around, so their absence could weaken their claim. The author isn't being greedy; they're following the will's instructions, which the play aunt set. The relatives' potential to contest the will adds legal risk, but the author isn't obligated to give up the inheritance just because they're upset. \n\nIn terms of social norms, there's a balance between respecting the deceased's wishes and family dynamics. The author acted in the way the play aunt wanted, which is a key point. The relatives' unhappiness is more about them not being included, but the author isn't at fault for that. The main factor is whether the author honored the play aunt's intentions, which they did. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the will, provided care, and the relatives aren't close. The answer should be B (No).\n"
