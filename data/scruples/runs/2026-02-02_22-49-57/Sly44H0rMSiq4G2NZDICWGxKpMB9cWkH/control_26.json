When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is being given an inheritance from their \"play aunt\" via their actual aunt as the executor. The key points here are the relationship, the context of helping out, and the relatives' reactions.\n\nFirst, the play aunt isn't a blood relative but was close to the author and their actual aunt. The author helped with tasks like snow shoveling and yard work for years without expecting payment. The play aunt had relatives who weren't close, and now they're upset about the will. They might contest it, but they haven't approached the author directly.\n\nThe author feels annoyed that the relatives are making a fuss, especially since they weren't around much. The husband says it's up to the author, but the question is whether keeping the inheritance makes the author an asshole.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the relatives can't contest it successfully, the author is within their rights. But morally, it's a gray area. The play aunt chose the author and their aunt, possibly out of gratitude for the help over the years. The relatives might feel left out, but their lack of presence complicates their claim. The author isn't obligated to give up the inheritance, especially if the will is clear. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
