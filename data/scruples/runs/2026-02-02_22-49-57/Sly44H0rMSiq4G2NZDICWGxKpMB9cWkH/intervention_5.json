When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The key points here are:\n\n1. The author and their actual aunt provided care and assistance to the play aunt over the years, like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn. The author didn't expect payment for this, considering the play aunt was nice and helpful to them and their family.\n\n2. The play aunt left her property and money to the author through her will. The actual aunt, as the executor, informed the author and suggested keeping everything. However, the play aunt's relatives, who weren't close to her, are unhappy and might contest the will.\n\n3. The author is conflicted but leans towards keeping the inheritance, feeling that the relatives weren't around when they were. The husband supports the author's decision, and the author is considering whether they're being an \"asshole\" by following the play aunt's wishes.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to agree or disagree. Let's consider legal and ethical angles. Legally, if the will is valid and the relatives are contesting it, that's a legal matter. But ethically, the author's actions seem justified. They provided long-term care, the play aunt chose to leave them the inheritance, and the relatives weren't involved. The author isn't obligated to give up something that was legally willed to them. The play aunt had the right to leave her estate as she wished. The author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement is understandable, given their lack of prior engagement. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
