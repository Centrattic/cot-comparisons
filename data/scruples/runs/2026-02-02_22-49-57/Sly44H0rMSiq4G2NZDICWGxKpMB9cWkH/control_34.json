When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the scenario is that the author, along with their actual aunt, helped take care of the \"play aunt\" by doing chores for her. The play aunt left her inheritance to the author, and now her real relatives are upset and considering contesting the will. The author is wondering if they're being an asshole by keeping the inheritance as per the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid and properly executed, then the author has a right to the inheritance. The relatives might not have a legal standing if the will was correctly made and witnessed. But the question is more about moral responsibility, not just legal. \n\nMoral-wise, the author and their aunt provided care and support for the play aunt over the years. The relatives weren't around, so maybe the play aunt felt indebted and wanted to thank them. The author might not feel obligated to share the inheritance because the relatives didn't contribute. But the relatives, on the other hand, might feel entitled as next of kin. \n\nThe author's husband says it's up to them, which adds another layer. The key here is whether the author is morally wrong for not giving up the inheritance. The author might argue they were a more deserving beneficiary, given their contributions. The relatives' anger is understandable, but maybe they didn't maintain a relationship with the play aunt, hence not expecting the inheritance. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the will reflects the play aunt's wishes, and the author's family was there for her when her own family wasn't. The relatives' reaction might be due to not being close, so the author isn't necessarily an asshole for following the will. So the answer is B.\n"
