When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who left her property and money to the author. The author's actual aunt is the executor and thinks the author should keep everything, but the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is considering keeping the inheritance despite the relatives' potential objections.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the legal aspect and the moral/ethical considerations. \n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the author is named as the beneficiary, then they have a right to the inheritance. The relatives could contest the will, but unless there's some legal issue with the will (like being made under duress or not properly executed), the author is within their rights to keep what was left to them. The author mentioned that the relatives haven't been around for years, and the play aunt spent holidays with the author's family. This might support the idea that the will reflects her true wishes.\n\nEthically, the question is whether the author should give up the inheritance despite the will. The author provided help to the play aunt over the years, though they didn't expect compensation. The play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids. The relatives' absence might be a factor in why the play aunt left everything to the author. The husband's opinion is that it's up to the author to decide, which suggests that there's no pressure from their side to share.\n\nHowever, some might argue that even if the relatives can't contest legally, it's morally considerate to at least acknowledge them or share the inheritance, given that they are blood relatives. But the author feels annoyed because the relatives weren't involved when the play aunt was alive. The author's actions align with the play aunt's wishes as expressed in the will, so if the will is valid, the author isn't in the wrong legally. Morally, it's a gray area, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not just morally but in general.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is respecting the will and the play aunt's wishes, and the legal rights are on their side. The relatives' potential contest is a separate issue, but unless the will is invalid, the author isn't wrong to keep it. The fact that the author isn't expecting compensation but is still keeping what was left seems justified.\n"
