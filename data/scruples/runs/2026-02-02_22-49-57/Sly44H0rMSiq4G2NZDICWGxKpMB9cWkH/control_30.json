When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgoing an inheritance they received from a \"play aunt.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author's actual aunt is the executor of the play aunt's estate. The play aunt wasn't blood-related but was close to the author's family. The family did chores for her over the years, which wasn't a big hassle. The play aunt left her property and money to the author, and now her relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is considering keeping the inheritance, and the husband says it's up to them. The user wants to know if the author is an asshole (in the WIBTA context) for following the will's wishes.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author had a good relationship with the play aunt, helped her out over the years, and the play aunt left her assets to the author. The relatives are upset but weren't close to her. The author is being asked if they should give up the inheritance despite the will.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid, the author is entitled to the inheritance. The relatives contesting would require proving the will was invalid, perhaps due to undue influence, lack of capacity, or fraud. Since the author isn't a blood relative, but the play aunt chose to leave her estate to them, the will's validity might be challenged. However, if the will is properly executed, the author has legal rights.\n\nMorally, it's more nuanced. The author helped care for the play aunt, and she expressed her wishes in the will. The relatives weren't involved in her care, which might justify the author keeping the inheritance. The author isn't obligated to give them anything unless there's a moral obligation they feel they have. The husband's advice to decide for themselves suggests that the decision is personal.\n\nThe author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement now after not being around shows a valid point. The play aunt spent more time with the author's family, which might reinforce the idea that her wishes were to benefit those who cared for her.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the author is okay as long as the will holds. Morally, since the play aunt made her intentions clear and the relatives weren't involved, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
