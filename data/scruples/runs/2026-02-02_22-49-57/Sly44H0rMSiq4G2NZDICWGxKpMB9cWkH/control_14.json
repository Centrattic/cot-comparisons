When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from a play aunt. The key points here are the relationship dynamics, the actions taken by the author and their family, and the legal/ethical implications.\n\nFirst, the play aunt isn't a blood relative. The author and their family helped her with chores over the years without expecting payment. The aunt left her estate to them, but her actual relatives are upset and considering contesting the will. The author is torn between honoring the will and dealing with potential family conflict.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the will is valid and the relatives haven't successfully contested it, the author isn't in the wrong. The will is a legal document, and if it's properly executed, the beneficiaries have a right to the inheritance. The relatives' dissatisfaction doesn't automatically make the author wrong unless there's evidence of fraud or undue influence.\n\nEthically, the author's family provided care and support over the years. The play aunt may have appreciated this and chosen to leave her assets to them. The relatives weren't involved in her daily life, so their absence could argue that the author was a more deserving beneficiary. However, some might argue that the relatives have a right to their share, especially if they're blood relatives. But since the author's family was more present, it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nThe author's husband supports their decision, which suggests that they're considering the emotional and practical aspects. The author isn't being greedy; they're honoring the play aunt's wishes. The relatives' threat to contest the will adds tension, but unless they win the contest, the author is within their rights.\n\nIn summary, legally the author isn't in the wrong, and ethically, given the circumstances, they're justified in keeping the inheritance as per the will.\n"
