When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance from their \"play aunt.\" Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the play aunt isn't a blood relative. She had a close relationship with the author's actual aunt and the author's family. They helped her with chores, which wasn't too burdensome. The author didn't expect anything in return, but the play aunt left her estate to the author. The relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is considering keeping the inheritance, while their husband says it's up to them.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the play aunt's wishes as stated in the will, the relationship with the author vs. her other relatives, and the potential legal contest. Legally, if the will is valid, the author has a right to the inheritance. The author's actions align with the aunt's stated wishes, which is important. The relatives not being close and not helping out could be a moral consideration too. The author might feel they did more for the aunt, so it's fair. But maybe the relatives could claim they're entitled, even if they weren't close. However, the will is a legal document, so if it's valid, the author isn't in the wrong. Emotionally, the author might feel conflicted, but legally and ethically, following the will's instructions is what they're supposed to do. Unless there's evidence of coercion or invalidity in the will, the author is probably okay.\n"
