When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The aunt left her property and money to them, and the relatives are upset but haven't contested the will. The author feels they were close, helped out over the years, and the relatives weren't around much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid and the author is a beneficiary, they have a legal right to the inheritance. The relatives talking about contesting it might be just talk if there's no legal basis. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nOn the moral side, the author helped the aunt for years without expecting anything. The aunt was nice to them growing up and helped their kids. The relatives weren't close. The author might feel that their contribution and relationship justify receiving the inheritance. The husband's advice to decide for themselves also supports the author's autonomy.\n\nThe relatives' reaction could stem from surprise or differing expectations, but they weren't involved in the aunt's life much. The author isn't required to share the inheritance unless legally obligated. Since they're not, the author's decision to keep it as per the will isn't morally wrong here.\n\nPossible counterpoints: Maybe the author should share out of goodwill, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about being generous. The author isn't obligated to do so. The key factors are the validity of the will, the relationship dynamics, and the author's role in caring for the aunt. All these factors lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
