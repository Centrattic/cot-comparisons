When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The scenario involves the author and their actual aunt helping the play aunt with tasks over the years. The play aunt left her estate to the author, and her relatives are upset about it, considering contesting the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The play aunt had the legal right to distribute her assets as she wished. Since she's not related by blood, her choice to leave everything to the author isn't automatically invalid. The relatives might have a case if they can prove undue influence or lack of mental capacity, but the author mentions that the relatives haven't been around much, and the play aunt spent most holidays with the author's family. That might weaken their legal standing.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author and their family provided care and support over the years, which the play aunt appreciated. The author didn't expect payment, but the inheritance is a testament to that relationship. The play aunt's relatives haven't been involved, so their sudden contestation might seem opportunistic. The author's husband advises it's up to them, which suggests there's no obligation to give it up unless the author feels morally compelled.\n\nThe key points are the play aunt's autonomy in deciding her estate, the author's longstanding support, and the relatives' lack of prior involvement. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong. Morally, the author isn't obligated to give up the inheritance unless they choose to out of goodwill. The relatives' potential contest is possible but not certain, and the author isn't responsible for their actions. So the answer is B (No).\n"
