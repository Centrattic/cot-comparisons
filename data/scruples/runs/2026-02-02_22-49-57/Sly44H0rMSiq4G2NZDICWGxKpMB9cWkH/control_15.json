When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received through their play aunt. The situation is that the play aunt wasn't a blood relative, but they helped her with chores since they lived nearby. The author didn't expect anything in return, but the aunt left them her estate. The relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will was properly executed and the author is a named beneficiary, then legally they are entitled to the inheritance. The relatives haven't officially contested it yet, just talked about it. So legally, the author is in the right.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author helped the play aunt out over the years, which built a relationship of mutual respect and care. The relatives weren't around, so it's understandable that the play aunt left the estate to someone who was present and supportive. The author isn't obligated to share unless there's a legal challenge. The husband's advice that it's up to them seems right. \n\nThe key points are: the will's validity, the relatives' lack of involvement, and the author's contributions. Since the author didn't do anything wrong legally or morally by following the will's instructions, they aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
