When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance from their \"play aunt.\" The situation is that the author and their actual aunt helped take care of the play aunt for years, doing small chores. The play aunt left her estate to the author, but her relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is considering keeping everything because the relatives weren't close and the play aunt spent more time with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid and the author is the rightful heir, then legally they are not in the wrong. The relatives contesting might not have a strong case if the will is properly executed. But maybe there's a question about the relatives' rights. However, the story says the relatives weren't close, which might weaken their case if they can't prove undue influence or lack of capacity in the play aunt.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author and their family provided support when needed, and the play aunt expressed her gratitude. The relatives weren't present, so morally, it's reasonable the author would accept the inheritance. The husband's comment that it's up to the author to decide also suggests that there's no obligation to give it up unless legally required.\n\nAnother point: the author mentions they wouldn't give the property and money but would share family pictures. That seems like a fair middle ground, sharing some items but keeping the assets. The annoyance at the relatives' sudden involvement after years of absence makes sense. The play aunt's wishes are clear, so respecting them is important.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: Some might say the relatives should get a share if they're next of kin. But if the play aunt chose to leave it to the author, especially since she was closer, that's her right. The relatives contesting might be seen as greedy if they weren't involved in her life.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because the inheritance was left to them by the deceased, and the relatives weren't present. Legally and morally, the author has a right to keep it unless the will is contested successfully, which it doesn't seem to be.\n"
