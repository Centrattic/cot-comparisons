When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relative. The author and their family helped care for the play aunt over the years by doing chores, which wasn't much extra work since they lived nearby. The play aunt left her estate to the author, and the relatives are upset and considering contesting the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the play aunt's will was properly executed and witnessed, then the author is entitled to the inheritance as per her wishes. The relatives might not have a legal standing if the will is valid. But if the will is contested, maybe there's a chance the relatives could get a share, especially if they are next of kin. However, the user mentions that the relatives weren't close and didn't visit much. The play aunt spent holidays with the author's family instead. That could support the intention behind the will.\n\nEthically, the author's family provided care and support over the years, so receiving the inheritance might be seen as a reward for that. The author isn't taking anything they weren't promised, just following the play aunt's wishes. The relatives' reaction could be seen as coming out of nowhere, especially if they were distant. The husband's advice that it's up to the author to decide is also a point in their favor.\n\nHowever, there's the possibility of a will contest. If the relatives do contest it, the author might need to defend the will's validity. But unless there's evidence of undue influence or the will being improperly executed, the author has a right to the inheritance. The author's annoyance is understandable given the relatives' lack of involvement. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the deceased's wishes, provided care, and the relatives' objections are based on their distance. Answer B.\n"
