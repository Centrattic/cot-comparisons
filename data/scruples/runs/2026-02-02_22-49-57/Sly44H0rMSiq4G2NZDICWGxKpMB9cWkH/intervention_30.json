When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received. The situation involves a \"play aunt\" who left her estate to the person, while her actual relatives are upset and considering contesting the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the will is valid, then the executor (the person's actual aunt) is handling the estate correctly. The author is being offered the inheritance according to the will, so legally, they have a right to it unless the relatives successfully contest the will. The relatives haven't approached the author directly, just the executor, which might mean they have some standing but haven't proven their claim yet.\n\nNext, the moral side. The author helped care for the play aunt over the years without expecting payment. The play aunt had a close relationship with them and their family, even during holidays. The relatives were not present, so the author's family provided care. The play aunt might have felt they were being taken care of by the author's family, hence leaving the inheritance. The author's actions were out of kindness and practicality, and the play aunt's decision to leave the estate to them was a gesture of gratitude.\n\nThe author is now being told by the relatives that they might contest the will, but the author isn't obligated to relinquish the inheritance unless legally required. The husband's advice supports the author's right to decide. The author isn't acting out of greed; they're following the will as it stands. The relatives' potential legal action is separate from the author's right in this scenario.\n\nAlso, the term \"play aunt\" indicates they weren't blood-related. The legal rights of the relatives depend on their relationship as per the law. If they are considered next of kin, they might have a claim, but if the will is valid and properly executed, the author's inheritance stands. The key here is the validity of the will and the intent of the deceased. Since the play aunt chose to leave her estate to someone who provided care and support, it's a legitimate decision.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're following the deceased's wishes and have no legal obligation to give up the inheritance unless the relatives successfully challenge the will. Morally, their actions align with the care they provided, and they're not being selfish by accepting what was left to them.\n"
