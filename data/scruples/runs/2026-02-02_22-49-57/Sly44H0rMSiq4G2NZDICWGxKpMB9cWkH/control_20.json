When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who left her property and money to the author. The key points are that the author and their family provided care and help to the play aunt over the years, the play aunt's actual relatives were not close, and now those relatives are unhappy about the inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the will was created by the deceased, and the author is being left the inheritance, unless the relatives can contest the will successfully, the author is entitled to it. The article mentions that the relatives talked about contesting the will but it's unclear how serious they are. If the will is valid, the author isn't in the wrong for taking what was left to them.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author didn't expect compensation but did help out, and the play aunt was nice to them. The relatives weren't around much. The author's aunt, as the executor, thinks they should keep it. The husband also says it's up to the author. The author feels annoyed that the relatives are involved now. \n\nMoral responsibility might depend on whether there's an obligation to share with distant relatives who weren't involved. However, since the deceased made a specific will, the author isn't obligated to change that. The relatives not being close might make the author's decision more justified. \n\nSo, combining legal and moral considerations, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). The author is following the deceased's wishes and the relatives' potential contest doesn't make the author wrong. The author isn't required to share unless there's a legal obligation, which there doesn't seem to be here.\n"
