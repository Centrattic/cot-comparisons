When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from the play aunt. The key points here are the actions of the writer, the intentions of the play aunt, and the reactions of the relatives.\n\nFirst, the writer mentions that they and their family helped the play aunt with tasks like shoveling snow and mowing grass. They didn't expect payment, but the play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids with college letters. So there's a history of mutual support and kindness. The play aunt left her estate, including her home, car, and life insurance, to the writer through their actual aunt, who is the executor. The relatives aren't close and haven't been involved, hence their potential to contest the will. The writer feels annoyed that the relatives are now involved after not being present during the play aunt's life.\n\nThe main issue is whether the writer should accept the inheritance as per the will. The play aunt's will explicitly names the writer, so legally, they are entitled to it. The relatives might contest it, but if the will is valid and they aren't close, the writer has a right to the inheritance. The writer's husband says it's up to them, so the decision is personal. The writer feels justified in keeping it because they provided care and support when the play aunt needed it, and the relatives were absent. \n\nMorally, the writer isn't in the wrong because the play aunt's wishes are clear, and the relatives didn't contribute to her care. The writer's actions align with the play aunt's expressed intentions. The annoyance comes from the relatives' sudden interest after being absent, which the writer has a right to feel. So, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
