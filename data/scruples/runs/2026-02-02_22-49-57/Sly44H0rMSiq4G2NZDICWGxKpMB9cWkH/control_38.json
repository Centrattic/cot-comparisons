When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, along with their actual aunt, did small tasks for the \"play aunt\" over the years, like shoveling snow or cutting grass. They didn't expect anything in return because the play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids with stuff like college letters. Now, the play aunt left her property and money to the author through her will, and her relatives are upset, maybe contesting the will.\n\nThe author is considering whether to just take everything as per the will. The main question is whether they're an asshole for doing that. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: if the will is valid and the play aunt explicitly left her estate to the author, then legally, the author is entitled to it. The relatives talking about contesting might be a hassle, but if the will is properly executed, there's not much they can do. So from a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nNext, the moral aspect. The author and their aunt did help out the play aunt, but they didn't do it for compensation. The play aunt's relatives haven't been around for years, and she spent holidays with the author's family instead. The author might feel that the relatives weren't part of the play aunt's life for a long time, so she had the right to give her assets to someone she considered family. The author's husband says it's up to them to decide. So morally, the author might not be in the wrong if they believed the play aunt intended for them to receive the inheritance.\n\nBut maybe the relatives have a claim. If they are next of kin legally, even if they weren't close, they might have some rights. However, the author's actual aunt is the executor, and she's okay with the author keeping it. The play aunt's relatives haven't spoken directly to the author about it, which could imply they're not in a position to contest. If the will is valid and the relatives can't prove undue influence or incapacity, the author is probably okay.\n\nThe author's annoyance at the relatives getting involved now might be justified if they were distant for years. The key here is whether the author was in the play aunt's will as a beneficiary, which she intended. Since the author didn't expect compensation before, this inheritance is a gesture of gratitude. The relatives might not have contributed as much, so it's the play aunt's choice.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong if they follow the will's instructions. The relatives' dissatisfaction doesn't necessarily make the author an asshole, especially if the play aunt's wishes are respected. The answer would be B.\n"
