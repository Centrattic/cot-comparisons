When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt,\" who isn't a blood relative. The author and their actual aunt took care of the play aunt by doing chores like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn. They didn't expect to be paid, just helping out because they were nearby and the play aunt was nice to them when they were a kid and helped their own kids with things like college letters.\n\nNow, the actual aunt is the executor of the estate and told the author they inherited the play aunt's property, money, car, and life insurance. The play aunt's real relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is annoyed that the relatives are coming forward now since they weren't around much, and the play aunt spent most holidays with the author's family. The husband says it's up to the author to decide if they want to give the relatives anything. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by just following the will's instructions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will was valid and the play aunt had the right to leave her assets to the author, then legally the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's a moral or ethical component here. The relatives might argue that they should get a share, especially if they were the legal heirs by blood. However, the play aunt had the right to leave her inheritance to whomever she chose, even non-relatives. The key here is whether the will was properly executed and if the relatives are legitimate heirs.\n\nThe author mentions that the play aunt's relatives \"talked about contesting her will,\" but only with the actual aunt, not the author. If the will is valid, contesting it would be their prerogative, but the author isn't obligated to do anything if the will stands. The author isn't being paid for their help, so there's no expectation of compensation, which is a point in their favor. The play aunt's own choices in terms of spending time and leaving her estate to the author's family rather than her distant relatives might indicate her true intentions.\n\nAnother angle is the relationship. The author and their family had a closer relationship with the play aunt, providing regular help and companionship. The relatives weren't around much, so maybe the play aunt felt they wouldn't have taken care of her as the author's family did. The author isn't being greedy; they're honoring the play aunt's wishes unless there's a legal challenge. If the relatives can't prove the will is invalid, the author is just following the deceased's instructions.\n\nThere's also the idea of being a \"blood relative\" versus a chosen family member. In many cultures, people can bequeath property to anyone they choose, regardless of blood ties. The author's actions are in line with what the play aunt wanted, so unless there's some legal issue with the will, they aren't in the wrong. The husband's advice that it's up to the author to decide if they give anything to the relatives supports that the author isn't legally bound but might choose to be generous.\n\nPotential issues could be if the will was made under duress or if the play aunt was of unsound mind, but the author didn't mention any such signs. Also, if the relatives are legal heirs and the will is contested, the author might need to go through a legal process. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong, not the legal outcome. Since the play aunt explicitly left the inheritance to the author, and the author had a long-standing relationship with her, providing care and support, the author is likely in the right. The answer is probably B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
