When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relative. The author was helped by their actual aunt and did chores for the play aunt, which wasn't a big hassle. The play aunt left her property and money to the author, and her relatives are upset about it.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the relationship dynamics, the service provided (like helping with chores), and the will's stipulations. The author's actual aunt is the executor and says to keep it all. The relatives are not close and haven't been around, but they might contest the will. The author feels annoyed that the relatives are now involved after being absent.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical angles. Legally, if the will is valid, the author has a right to the inheritance. The play aunt had the right to bequeath her assets as she saw fit. Ethically, the author helped her out of kindness and didn't expect payment. The relatives weren't involved in her daily life, so maybe their lack of presence makes the author's acceptance more justified. However, there's a potential for conflict if the relatives contest the will. The author might be in a tough spot if they have to fight legal battles, but that's more about the situation than their moral standing.\n\nThe author's husband says it's up to them, which adds that personal decision is involved. The author isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless there's a legal challenge. The fact that the play aunt had a close relationship with the actual aunt and the author's family might support the validity of the bequest. The author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement is understandable since they were absent for years.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the play aunt's wishes, and the relatives' potential contest is their issue, not the author's. The answer should be B.\n"
