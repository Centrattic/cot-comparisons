When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA question is in the wrong. The situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt,\" who wasn't a blood relative. The key points here are the relationship dynamics, the care provided by the writer and their family, and the conflict with the play aunt's relatives.\n\nFirst, the writer's family wasn't related by blood but had a close relationship with the play aunt. They helped her with chores, which wasn't too burdensome since they were nearby. The play aunt left her estate to the writer's actual aunt, who then passed the inheritance to the writer. The relatives are upset and might contest the will. The writer is annoyed because the relatives weren't around much, and now they're objecting.\n\nThe question is whether the writer is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance. The author's argument is that they were the ones providing care and support, and the relatives were absent. The play aunt's will was made with the knowledge of the actual aunt, who is the executor. The relatives haven't spoken directly to the writer, just the aunt.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and properly executed, the inheritance should go as per the will. The writer isn't legally in the wrong. Ethically, since they provided care and the relatives were distant, it's reasonable for the writer to accept the inheritance. The relatives might contest the will, but unless there's evidence of undue influence or the will is invalid, the writer has a moral claim based on their long-term support. The husband's opinion is that the decision is the writer's, which supports the idea that they aren't obligated to give it up. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
