When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received. The situation involves a play aunt who wasn't blood-related, and the author along with their actual aunt did chores for her over the years. The play aunt left her estate to the author, but her relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the author was named in the will, unless the will is contested successfully, they are legally entitled to the inheritance. The relatives haven't gone to court yet, so legally, the author is okay. But the question is about whether they're morally or socially in the wrong.\n\nThe author mentions that the relatives weren't close to the play aunt for years. They were the ones who provided care and support, even helping with their own kids. The play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helpful to them. So there's a sense of reciprocal benefit here. The actual aunt, as executor, thinks the author should keep it, which adds weight to the idea that it's acceptable.\n\nThe author's husband says it's up to them, which is important. The author feels annoyed that the relatives are now involved after not being present. The relatives might feel entitled, but if they weren't part of the play aunt's life, is it fair to expect them to be considered?\n\nMoral considerations: Was the inheritance left to the author intentionally? Since the will says so, it's the play aunt's final decision. The relatives not being close might mean they shouldn't expect it. However, sometimes family can claim a right regardless of closeness. But in this case, the author had a more active role in the play aunt's care, which could justify the inheritance.\n\nSocially, there's a gray area. The author might be seen as selfish if they take the inheritance without sharing, but since the will explicitly states they should have it, and the author had a closer relationship, it's more justified. The key points are the will's validity, the care provided, and the relatives' lack of involvement.\n\nSo putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong. They were named in the will, provided care, and the relatives weren't close. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
