When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received through their play aunt's will. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, let's break down the scenario. The play aunt isn't a blood relative but was close to the user's actual aunt. The user and their family helped the play aunt with chores like shoveling snow and cutting grass for years. They didn't expect payment because the aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids with college letters. The play aunt's relatives, who weren't close, are upset and might contest the will. The user's actual aunt, as the executor, told them to keep everything but the relatives are unhappy.\n\nThe user is annoyed that the relatives are now involved after not being around. They don't plan to give the money or property to the relatives, even if asked. The husband says it's up to them to decide, so the question is whether the user is an asshole for keeping the inheritance.\n\nNow, considering the factors: the play aunt made a will in their favor, which is her right. The relatives weren't around, so they might not have a strong claim. The user and their family provided support over the years, so the play aunt likely felt grateful. Legally, if the will is valid and the relatives contest it, the user might be in a legal battle, but morally, the user could argue they were treated as family and the decision was the aunt's. However, maybe the user should consider the relatives' feelings or share something, but the question is if they're in the wrong for not doing so.\n\nThe key points are the intent of the play aunt (she chose who to leave it to), the effort the user's family put in, and the relatives' lack of involvement. The user is following the play aunt's wishes, which is a strong point in their favor. The relatives contesting might be their own problem. So, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for keeping what was left to them. The answer would be B, No.\n"
