When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The situation involves a non-blood relative who left her estate to the author, and her actual relatives are upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the play aunt left her will specifying the author as the heir, unless the relatives can contest the will successfully, the author is legally entitled to the inheritance. The relatives might have a case if they can prove the will was made under undue influence, but the author mentions that the relatives weren't close and hadn't been around much. The play aunt spent more time with the author's family, so there's a question of whether she had the legal right to leave everything to the author. But unless there's a legal issue with the will, the author is within their rights.\n\nEthically, it's trickier. The author didn't expect compensation for helping out, but the play aunt left them the inheritance. The author is conflicted because they find the relatives annoying, especially since they weren't present for the play aunt's life. The husband's advice that it's up to the author suggests that the decision is personal. However, the relatives are unhappy and might contest the will. The author could face pressure to share, but if legally they're entitled, maybe they aren't in the wrong morally. The key here is the intent of the play aunt. If she genuinely wanted the author to have everything, then the author is following her wishes. The relatives not being close might mean they weren't her intended beneficiaries. \n\nAlso, the author provided care and support, which the play aunt appreciated, which could justify the inheritance. The relatives not being involved might mean they don't have a strong moral claim. However, there's a societal expectation sometimes to share with family. But in this case, since the relatives were distant, maybe the author isn't wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together: legally, the author is okay. Ethically, following the wishes of someone who was close to you and not giving to distant relatives who weren't involved might not be wrong. The answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
