When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for keeping an inheritance from a \"play aunt.\" The aunt in question isn't a blood relative but was close to them and their actual aunt. They helped out with chores over the years, and now the play aunt left her estate to them. The relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, the user's main point is whether keeping the inheritance makes them an asshole. The play aunt never had kids, and the user's family was there for her, so the will reflects her wishes. The relatives weren't around much, so the user feels justified in not sharing. Legally, if the will is valid, the user is entitled to the inheritance. But morally, is it wrong?\n\nThe user's husband says it's up to them. The key here is the play aunt's intent. If she intended for the user to receive the inheritance, then the user is just following her wishes. The relatives not being close could be a point in the user's favor. However, maybe the relatives feel entitled because they're family, even if they weren't present. But the user provided care and support, which might have been a reason the play aunt left it to them.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the user isn't in the wrong. They're honoring the play aunt's wishes and had a long-standing relationship. The answer should be B.\n"
