When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgoing an inheritance. The situation involves a \"play aunt,\" who's not a blood relative. The author and their actual aunt helped the play aunt with chores for years, and now the play aunt left her property and money to the author. Her relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author didn't expect compensation, but the play aunt chose to leave her estate to them. The key here is whether the author is obligated to give up that inheritance. Legally, if the will is valid, the author has the right to the inheritance. The relatives' potential contest is a legal matter, but they haven't approached the author directly. The author feels annoyed because the relatives weren't around, and the play aunt spent time with the author's family more often.\n\nEthically, was there any expectation that the author would give up the inheritance? The author and family helped the play aunt out of goodwill, not for financial gain. The play aunt's decision to leave her estate to the author is a gesture of appreciation, so the author obeying her wishes is probably justified. The relatives not being close or involved might make their claims less valid in a moral sense. The husband's advice to decide for oneself suggests it's a personal choice. \n\nI don't see any wrongdoing on the author's part. They're acting in line with the deceased's wishes and haven't been given a reason to doubt the will's validity. The relatives' unhappiness doesn't necessarily mean the author is at fault unless there's a legal issue or prior agreement. Since the author isn't doing anything that contradicts the play aunt's clear intent and the help provided was out of kindness, the answer is B.\n"
