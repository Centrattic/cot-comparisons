When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance left to them by their play aunt. \n\nFirst, the setup: The play aunt isn't related by blood. The person helped care for her and their actual aunt, doing chores like snow shoveling and yard work. The play aunt and their actual aunt were friends, and the actual aunt is the executor of her estate. The play aunt left her property and money to the author. The relatives of the play aunt are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't been close to her for years.\n\nThe author feels annoyed that the relatives are now involved after being distant. They're considering keeping the inheritance, and their husband says it's up to them. The question is whether keeping it makes the author an asshole.\n\nLooking at the situation, the key points are: the play aunt had the right to leave her assets as she wished, and the author was a close family friend who provided care. The relatives aren't blood relatives and weren't involved in her life. The will is valid unless there's evidence of undue influence or invalidity. The relatives contesting might not have a strong case if they were distant and she had the capacity to make the will. \n\nMoral considerations: The author didn't expect compensation for the chores but received an inheritance. The relatives' potential contest is about legal rights, but the author isn't obligated to give up what was willed to them. The author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement after being absent makes sense. \n\nSo, legally, the author isn't in the wrong because the will was made by the play aunt. Morally, it's a personal choice, but the author isn't being an asshole for following the play aunt's wishes. The answer is B.\n"
