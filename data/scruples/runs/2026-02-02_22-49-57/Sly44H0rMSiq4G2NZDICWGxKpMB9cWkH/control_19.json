When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nSo, the author, let's call them \"Person A,\" had a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relative. This play aunt and their actual aunt were friends. Neither had kids. Person A and their family did chores for the play aunt, like snow shoveling and lawn care, which were convenient since they were nearby. They didn't expect payment because the play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids with things like college letters. \n\nNow, the play aunt died, and Person A's actual aunt, who is the executor, told them they were left the play aunt's property and money. The relatives of the play aunt are upset and might contest the will. Person A is annoyed because these relatives weren't around, and the play aunt spent most holidays with their family. They're considering keeping the inheritance but are unsure if they're being an asshole.\n\nThe question is whether Person A is in the wrong. The key factors here are: Did Person A do anything to deserve the inheritance? The play aunt left her estate to them, so according to the will, they are the rightful heirs. The relatives are contesting it, but if the will is valid, Person A has a legal right to it. \n\nBut there's also the ethical angle. The play aunt wasn't a blood relative, so it's possible the relatives feel they should have been considered. However, the play aunt had a close relationship with Person A's family for years, and they provided care and support. The relatives weren't around, so maybe the play aunt's decision was based on who was actually present and helpful. \n\nPerson A's husband says it's up to them to decide if they want to give anything to the relatives. The author is conflicted. The core issue is whether following the will's terms makes them an \"asshole\" if the relatives are upset. Legally, they're not in the wrong because the will dictates the inheritance. Ethically, it's more nuanced. If the will reflects the deceased's wishes, then Person A should honor it. Unless there's evidence of undue influence or the will is invalid, Person A isn't in the wrong. The relatives contesting might be a legal matter, but unless they can prove the will is invalid, Person A is in the right to accept the inheritance. So the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
