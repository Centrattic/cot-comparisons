When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether they should keep an inheritance they were left by their \"play aunt\" or not. The play aunt wasn't a blood relative but was close to the author's actual aunt. The author and their family helped take care of the play aunt by doing chores like shoveling snow and cutting grass. They didn't expect anything in return, but the play aunt left them her property and money through her will, with the actual aunt as the executor.\n\nThe relatives of the play aunt are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't approached the author directly. The author is conflicted because they feel the relatives weren't around, and the play aunt spent most holidays with them. They don't want to give up the inheritance but are wondering if they're being an asshole by keeping it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the will is valid and the relatives haven't been notified or involved in the process, the author might be legally entitled to the inheritance. However, the relatives might have grounds to contest if they weren't properly notified, depending on the jurisdiction. But the author's actual aunt is the executor, so she probably handled the legal stuff correctly.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author and their family provided care and support to the play aunt over the years, which might justify the inheritance. The relatives weren't present, so maybe the play aunt made a conscious decision to reward those who were there for her. The author's husband says it's up to them, which suggests that there's no obligation to share unless legally required.\n\nHowever, the author is concerned about being seen as an asshole. If the relatives are contesting the will, it's possible they feel entitled, but if they weren't involved in the play aunt's life, the author could argue that the inheritance is rightfully theirs. The key factors here are the intent of the will, the relationship with the play aunt, and the actions of the relatives.\n\nIn many cases, the testator (the person making the will) has the right to leave their assets to anyone they choose. Since the play aunt chose the author's actual aunt as the executor, she likely intended for the author to receive the inheritance. The author isn't obligated to share unless legally compelled. Unless there's a legal challenge, the author isn't in the wrong for following the will's instructions. The relatives' possible contesting might not hold up if they weren't close to the play aunt and didn't provide care.\n\nSo, considering both legal and moral angles, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping the inheritance as per the will's terms. The answer should be B.\n"
