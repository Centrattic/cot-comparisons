When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for keeping an inheritance from their \"play aunt.\" The situation involves some legal and moral considerations.\n\nFirst, the author's \"play aunt\" isn't a blood relative, but they had a close relationship. The aunt left her estate to the author, and her actual relatives are upset about it. The author helped care for the aunt, like shoveling snow and cutting grass, which wasn't too much work since they were nearby. The real aunt is the executor and thinks the author should keep everything, but the other relatives are considering contesting the will.\n\nThe key points here are about the will's validity and the author's moral responsibility. Since the author is the intended beneficiary according to the will, legally they have a right to the inheritance. The relatives haven't approached the author directly, which is a bit strange. The author feels annoyed that the relatives are now involved after not being around much. The husband advises the author to decide whether to give anything to the relatives.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and properly executed, the author isn't in the wrong for taking what was left to them. The relatives might contest the will if they believe it's invalid, but the author isn't necessarily at fault unless there's evidence of undue influence or something like that. Morally, the author might feel conflicted, but they also provided care and had a closer relationship. The author isn't obligated to give up the inheritance unless they choose to. The question is whether they're in the wrong for following the will's instructions. Since the author hasn't done anything illegal or unethical beyond what the will states, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
