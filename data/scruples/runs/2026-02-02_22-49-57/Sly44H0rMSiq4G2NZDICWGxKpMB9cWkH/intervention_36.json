When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" So, first, let me parse the details.\n\nThe play aunt wasn't a blood relative but was close to the author's actual aunt. The two aunts were friends, and the author and their family helped both of them with chores like snow shoveling and gardening. The author didn't expect payment for these chores, which makes sense since they were neighbors and the work wasn't too much. The play aunt had relatives who weren't close, and after her death, they're upset about the will leaving everything to the author. The author's actual aunt is the executor and supports the will, but the relatives are considering contesting it. The author is annoyed they're involved now, especially since the relatives weren't around much.\n\nThe key points here are: the author didn't ask for the inheritance, it was the deceased's will, the relatives weren't close, and the author's family had a history of helping both aunts. The author's husband says it's up to them to decide. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by keeping the inheritance as per the will.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the will is valid and the relatives aren't contesting it successfully, the author isn't in the wrong. Emotionally, the author might feel conflicted because the relatives are upset. But legally and ethically, since the play aunt chose to leave it to them and the relatives weren't involved, the author isn't obligated to give it up. However, maybe the author could consider sharing if they feel comfortable, but it's not required. The answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
