When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author is being offered an inheritance from their \"play aunt,\" not a blood relation. They helped out with tasks for the play aunt and their actual aunt over the years without expecting payment. Now, the play aunt's actual relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nThe author is annoyed that the relatives are involved now, especially since they weren't around much. The key points here are the relationship between the author and the play aunt, the nature of the help provided, and the will's terms. The author didn't expect anything in return for the help, which suggests there's no quid pro quo. The play aunt chose to leave everything to the author, likely as a gesture of gratitude and the close relationship they built over the years.\n\nThe relatives' contest might be based on legal grounds, but the author isn't in the wrong if the will is valid. The author isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless legally required. Their annoyance at the relatives' sudden interest is understandable, given their long absence. The husband's support in the decision adds to the idea that the author is acting in good faith.\n\nSo, considering the circumstances, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the play aunt's wishes, and the relatives' reaction seems more about their own inaction and sudden interest in the estate. The author has every right to accept the inheritance as intended.\n"
