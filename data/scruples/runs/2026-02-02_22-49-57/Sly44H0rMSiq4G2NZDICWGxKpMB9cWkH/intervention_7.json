When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they were left by their \"play aunt.\" The situation involves a non-blood relative who left her estate to the author, even though she has other relatives who are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid and properly executed, the author has the right to keep the inheritance. The relatives aren't mentioned as being named in the will, so legally, the author isn't obligated to share unless the will is contested successfully. The author's aunt is the executor, and she's advising them to keep everything. If the will is valid, the author isn't doing anything illegal.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author mentions they helped the play aunt and their own aunt with chores for years without expecting payment. The play aunt was nice and helpful to the author's kids. The author feels justified in keeping the inheritance because the relatives weren't close and didn't help during the aunt's lifetime. The husband also says it's up to the author. The author isn't being greedy; they're respecting the play aunt's wishes as stated in the will.\n\nThe relatives are upset, but if they haven't been in contact for years and didn't participate in the aunt's life, their claim might be weaker in terms of moral standing. The author's annoyance is justified if the relatives never showed up. The author isn't required to share the inheritance unless the will is contested, which the relatives might not do successfully. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're following the will's instructions, and the relatives' potential contest doesn't change that. The author's actions are both legally and morally sound given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
