When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" \n\nFirst, the setup: The author and their actual aunt helped the play aunt with chores for years. The play aunt wasn't a blood relative but was close. She left her estate to the author via the actual aunt, who is the executor. The play aunt's actual relatives are upset and considering contesting the will. The author is considering keeping the inheritance.\n\nThe key points here are the intentions of the people involved and the legal standing. The play aunt clearly intended to leave her assets to the author, as she made the actual aunt the executor and communicated her wishes. The author's actions were based on their long-term assistance and the play aunt's gratitude, which might be seen as a legal will.\n\nThe relatives haven't taken legal action, which is important. Just because they're unhappy doesn't mean they have a valid case unless there's some legal issue with the will, like lack of mental capacity or undue influence. The author isn't the one making the will; they're following the deceased's wishes as stated. The husband's advice that it's up to the author to decide aligns with the idea that they aren't obligated to change the will's terms unless legally required.\n\nEthically, the author might feel guilty if the relatives were closer, but the facts state that they weren't involved much. The play aunt spent holidays with the author's family more. So, the author isn't the one creating the will's terms\u2014those were the play aunt's decisions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for following the deceased's stated wishes unless there's a legal reason to return the inheritance, which isn't indicated here. So the answer is B.\n"
