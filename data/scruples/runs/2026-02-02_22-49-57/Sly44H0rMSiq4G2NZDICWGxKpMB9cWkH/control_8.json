When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt,\" who wasn't a blood relative. The key points here are:\n\n1. The play aunt had a close relationship with the actual aunt and the person in question (the author). They did favors for the play aunt, like shoveling snow and cutting grass, which wasn't much extra work. The aunt and the author didn't expect payment but did it out of kindness.\n\n2. The play aunt left her estate (home, car, insurance) to the author. The actual aunt, who is the executor, thinks the author should keep everything. However, the play aunt's biological relatives, who weren't close, are upset and might contest the will.\n\n3. The author feels annoyed that these relatives are now involved since they weren't around when the play aunt needed help. The husband says it's up to the author to decide. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they keep the inheritance as per the will.\n\nFirst, legally, if the will is valid and the play aunt intended to leave her assets to the author, then the author is entitled to it. The relatives contesting the will would need to prove that the will was made under undue influence, fraud, or some other legal grounds. But if the relatives weren't close and didn't contribute, their claim might be weak legally.\n\nMorally, the author did help take care of the play aunt, so being named in the will could be seen as a recognition of that care. The relatives not being around might make them less deserving. The author might feel that their actions over the years justified the inheritance.\n\nHowever, there's a potential for conflict here. If the relatives contest the will and it goes to court, the author might face legal challenges. But if the will is properly executed and the author is a named beneficiary, they have a right to the inheritance. The key is whether the will is valid. If the relatives weren't included in the will, maybe they were already aware of the play aunt's intentions. The author's decision not to give them anything beyond family pictures is also a personal choice.\n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" the author isn't obligated to give up the inheritance. The play aunt's will is her final wish, and respecting that is important. The author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement is understandable, especially if they neglected the play aunt for years. The author's actions were in good faith, helping without expecting anything, and the inheritance is a result of the play aunt's gratitude.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
