When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance. The situation is that the person's \"play aunt\" left them her property and money. The play aunt wasn't a blood relative, but they had a close relationship where the person and their actual aunt helped her with chores for years. Now, the play aunt's relatives are upset and considering contesting the will.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. The will is valid, and the executor (the actual aunt) is okay with the distribution. The relatives haven't taken legal action, just expressed dissatisfaction. Legally, if the will is sound and signed properly, the author has a right to the inheritance. So legally, they're not wrong.\n\nThen the moral aspect. The author helped the play aunt for years without expecting anything. The play aunt left the inheritance, which the author didn't expect. The relatives were distant, didn't visit much, and weren't close. The author feels annoyed the relatives are now involved. The husband says it's up to them. Morally, if the play aunt intended to give the inheritance, the author is respecting her wishes. The relatives not being involved might have contributed to their exclusion. The author isn't obligated to share unless there's a legal challenge or moral obligation beyond what they had with the play aunt.\n\nSo, putting it together, both legally and morally, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
