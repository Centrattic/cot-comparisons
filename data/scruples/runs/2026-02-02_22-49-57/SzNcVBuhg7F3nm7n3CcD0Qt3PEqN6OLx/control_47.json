He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for causing their brother's vegan cake to be treated as Play-Doh.\n\nFirst, the context is a family brunch where the brother made a vegan cake. The author, seeing the cake's color and texture, joked that it looked like Play-Doh. The daughter then started treating it as such, leading the whole family to do arts and crafts with it instead of eating the cake. The brother was upset because his creation was ruined.\n\nSo, the main points to consider: Did the author's actions cause harm? The brother was proud of his dessert, and the family's actions prevented him from sharing it. The author acknowledges they've been giving the brother a hard time about veganism in the past, even if they claim to have been respectful lately. The comment was made in a family setting, maybe as a joke, but it led to unintended consequences.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, they did make a joke that led to others not eating the cake. The brother's intention was to provide dessert, which was thwarted. The author might have crossed a line by mocking the brother's effort, even if it was a joke. Also, the daughter was young, so the author's comment could have influenced her actions. The brother's feelings were hurt, which is a valid concern. However, maybe the brother's dessert's appearance was so unusual that it invited the joke. But the author's role was to recognize the effort and not undermine it. \n\nConsidering that the author felt guilty afterward, it suggests they acknowledge some wrongdoing. The key here is intent vs. impact. Even if the author didn't mean to mock, the result was that the brother's effort was wasted. In family dynamics, respecting others' contributions is important. So, the author is in the wrong because their comment led to the brother's dessert being treated as a toy instead of being eaten, disregarding his effort and feelings.\n"
