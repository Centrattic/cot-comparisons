He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-doh, leading everyone to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The brother made a vegan cake, which looked and smelled like Play-doh. The author, who has a history of teasing their brother about veganism, told their daughter it was Play-doh. That led the whole family to play with it, which upset the brother.\n\nSo, the main question is about responsibility here. The author's intention was probably a joke, but the result was that the brother's effort was wasted, and he was upset. The author does feel guilty, which suggests they think they might have done something wrong.\n\nBut is it actually wrong? Well, the brother made the cake, so he's responsible for how it was presented. However, the author's comment was the catalyst. Even if it was meant as a joke, saying it to a child might not have been the best idea. The author should have considered that the brother would be upset if his dish was treated as a toy. Also, the brother was proud of his creation, so the joke might have been in poor taste, even if the author has been respecting his choices lately.\n\nAnother angle: the brother could have explained the cake better. But the family had already started playing, so maybe the author's joke crossed a line. The key points are intent vs. impact. The author didn't mean harm, but the impact was negative on their brother. So, even if it was a joke, if it caused someone else distress, the author might be at fault.\n\nAlso, the fact that they made a four-year-old think it was Play-doh could be seen as irresponsible. Kids don't understand boundaries as well, so the parent should have been more careful. The author's actions led to a situation that the brother found amusing but ultimately hurt his feelings or efforts.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, humor is a factor, but if someone is genuinely upset, the person making the joke is often considered at fault. The author's guilt also supports that they think they're in the wrong. So probably, the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
