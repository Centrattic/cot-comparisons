He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, the context: The brother made a vegan cake, which the author found resembled Play-Doh. The author, knowing about the brother's pride in his veganism, made a joke that led the kids and the family to play with the cake. The brother was upset because his dessert wasn't eaten. The author feels guilty about the fun they had at the brother's expense.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, intention matters. The author didn't mean to be malicious but their actions led to the brother's dessert being wasted. The brother put effort into making something special, and the family's actions probably hurt his feelings. The author acknowledges they've been giving the brother a hard time before, even if they've been respectful lately. Making a joke that results in the dessert being ruined, even if it was a mistake, shows a lack of consideration for the brother's feelings and effort.\n\nAdditionally, the daughter is young and might not understand the context of veganism or the brother's effort. The author's reaction set a precedent for the rest of the family to follow, which could be seen as mocking the brother's choice, even if unintentionally. The outcome was that the brother was upset, and the family's enjoyment came at his expense. That seems unfair. The author's guilt suggests they recognize the impact of their actions, which implies that they were wrong in some way, even if not maliciously.\n"
