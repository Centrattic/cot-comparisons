He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for making their daughter think her uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother put a lot of effort into making a vegan dessert. The author, who has a history of teasing the brother about his veganism, jokingly told their daughter it was Play-Doh. This led to the entire family playing with the cake, which upset the brother.\n\nIs the author responsible? Well, they admitted they couldn't help but compare the cake to Play-Doh. But they did make the comment to their daughter, which started the chain reaction. Even if it was a joke, it had consequences. The brother was proud of his creation, and the family's actions ruined his dessert. The author later feels guilty about enjoying the joke.\n\nFactors to consider: Intent vs. impact. The author might not have meant to be malicious, just found the cake's appearance amusing. However, the impact was negative on the brother. The family's reaction was playful, but it disrespected the brother's effort. The author's role in initiating the joke is key here. Even if others joined in, the root cause was their initial comment. \n\nAlso, the brother's dietary choices were respected before, but this situation might show a lack of consideration. The author should have been more mindful of how their comment could affect the brother's feelings. \n\nIn AITA situations, the line between a harmless joke and hurtful behavior is thin. Since the brother was not amused and it ruined the brunch's vegan addition, the author's actions had a negative effect despite the humor intended. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
