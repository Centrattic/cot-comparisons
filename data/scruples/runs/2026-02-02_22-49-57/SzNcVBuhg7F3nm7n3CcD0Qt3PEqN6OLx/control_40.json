He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author made their daughter think her uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The brother was proud of his dessert, but the joke backfired and ruined the vegan addition to the brunch.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author has a history of teasing their brother about veganism but claims they've been respecting it lately. In this case, the brother made a green mung bean cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author's daughter asked what it was, and the author jokingly said it was Play-Doh. The family then used it for arts and crafts instead of eating it, which upset the brother.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The brother was proud of his creation, which was a special effort for the family meal. The author's joke led to the family not using the dessert as intended. Even if it was a joke, the author's comment directly caused the misunderstanding. The daughter is only four, so she's going to believe her parent's answer. The author's actions, whether intentional or not, prevented the brother's dessert from being eaten and caused distress. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother chose to make a cake that looked like Play-Doh. Maybe he could have presented it differently. But the author's responsibility as a parent is to correctly identify food for their child. The joke was in poor taste, even if it was accidental. The author's guilt is evident, which suggests they recognize the possible harm they caused. \n\nSo, considering the brother's effort and the family's enjoyment at the expense of his pride, the author's actions led to the situation. Even if it was a mistake, the outcome was negative for the brother. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
