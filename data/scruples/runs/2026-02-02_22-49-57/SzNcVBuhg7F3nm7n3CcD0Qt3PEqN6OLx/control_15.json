He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake, which the author thought looked like Play-Doh. The author told their daughter it was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to use it for arts and crafts instead of eating it. The brother wasn't amused.\n\nHmm. The author mentions that they've been giving their brother a hard time about his veganism in the past but have been respecting it lately. The brother was proud of his creation, but the author's joke led to the family playing with it. The key points here are intent and the consequences.\n\nThe author's action was unintentional in the sense that they didn't mean to ruin the brunch, but they did say \"It\u2019s Play-doh\" on a whim. The daughter took it literally, and the whole family followed suit. The brother's cake was ruined, and the author feels guilty. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't have malicious intent, but their comment led to the family not eating the cake and the brother being upset. The author's history of teasing might play a role here. Even if they were trying to be playful, the outcome was negative. The brother was proud of his creation, and the family's actions were disrespectful. \n\nHowever, the author might argue it was a mistake and a joke gone wrong. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. The brother prepared the cake with pride, and the author's comment undermined that. The responsibility lies with the author for making the offhand comment without considering the consequences. Even if it was a joke, it affected the brother's feelings and the event. \n\nSo, probably the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because the author's actions, though maybe not malicious, resulted in the brother's dish being treated as a toy. The author should have thought before reacting, especially considering the brother's efforts. The family's actions were a result of the author's comment, so they bear some responsibility.\n"
