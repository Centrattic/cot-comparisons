He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, the brother made a vegan cake, which the author found to look and smell like Play-Doh. The daughter asked what it was, and the author joked that it was Play-Doh. The whole family then played with the cake, which upset the brother. The author feels guilty about the fun they had at the brother's expense.\n\nI need to consider intent and consequences. The author mentioned they've been respecting their brother's veganism lately, so maybe the comment was a joke. But the brother was proud of his creation, and the family's actions ruined it. The daughter was young, so maybe the author didn't mean to mock the brother's effort, but the result was hurtful. However, it was an accident, and the author felt guilty afterward. The key points are whether the joke was malicious and if the family's actions were respectful or dismissive. Since it was a family event and the brother was not amused, maybe the author should have been more cautious. But since the comment was made to a child and the situation spiraled, it's unclear if the author is fully responsible. The answer could be B (not wrong) because it was a joke without intent to hurt, but maybe A because it led to disrespecting the brother's effort. Hmm.\n"
