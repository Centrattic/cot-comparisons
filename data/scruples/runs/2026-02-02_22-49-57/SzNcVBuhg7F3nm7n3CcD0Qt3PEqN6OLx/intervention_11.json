He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, the brother put effort into making a vegan cake for Christmas brunch. The author, despite usually respecting the brother's dietary choices, made a joke that the cake looked like Play-Doh. The daughter then took it literally and started playing with it, and others joined in. The brother was upset because the cake wasn't eaten, and the author feels guilty about having fun at his expense.\n\nI need to decide if the author is wrong. The key points here are intent and impact. The author didn't maliciously want to ruin the cake; it was an innocent comment made in a lighthearted moment. The daughter's reaction was unexpected, leading to the unintended consequence. The author respects the brother's choices but made a joke, which backfired. However, the brother might feel disrespected or his effort was undermined. But since the author didn't intend to harm, maybe it's not wrong. However, the impact was negative. Sometimes even jokes can have unintended consequences. But considering the context, it's a family gathering, and the author's comment was a playful mistake without malice. The brother might have overreacted, but the author's actions did cause the cake to be wasted. So maybe there's some fault there. On the other hand, the daughter's reaction was the catalyst, and the author didn't foresee it. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the mistake was accidental and not malicious. But I'm not entirely sure. The brother's feelings were hurt, but the author's intention wasn't to mock. So maybe B is the answer.\n"
