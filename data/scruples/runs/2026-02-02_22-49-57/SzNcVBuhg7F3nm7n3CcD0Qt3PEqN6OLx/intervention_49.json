He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-Doh. The situation involves a family brunch where the brother made a vegan dessert, and the author jokingly referred to it as Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother took pride in making a vegan dessert, which the author had previously given him a hard time about. Now, they're being respectful. The key point here is the author's intent. They said it was a joke, a blurted out comment when their daughter asked. The author didn't mean to ruin the brother's dessert on purpose. It was an accidental misunderstanding fueled by the dessert's appearance and the child's innocent question.\n\nNext, the family's reaction. Everyone joined in the arts and crafts, which might have been fun but did ruin the brother's effort. The brother wasn't amused, so there's a sense of hurt feelings. However, the author feels guilty about the fun they had. The question is whether the joke crossed a line.\n\nConsidering the brother's dietary choices and pride in his creation, the author's comment, even if a joke, led to the dessert not being eaten. But the brother had chosen to prepare a vegan dessert, which might have been a personal challenge. The author might not have intended to mock, just made a playful comment based on the dessert's resemblance to Play-Doh.\n\nHowever, the consequence was that the brother's effort was wasted. The author could be seen as dismissive, even if unintentionally, of the brother's efforts. The line between a harmless joke and being disrespectful can be thin. But since the author didn't intend to mock and felt guilty afterward, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The brother's own choice to make a dessert that looks like Play-Doh might also play a role\u2014maybe he should have considered how it might be perceived.\n\nIn family settings, humor can sometimes backfire. The author's comment led to unintended consequences. Whether it's wrong depends on intent versus impact. The impact was negative for the brother, but the intent was playful. In such cases, some might say the author is not in the wrong because it was a mistake, while others might argue that they should have been more mindful. The answer might hinge on whether the joke was inconsiderate or just a slip-up.\n"
