He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a brother making a vegan cake that the author's daughter thought was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother put effort into making a vegan dessert, which the author has a history of teasing about. But in this case, the author's comment was made in the moment, thinking it looked like Play-Doh. The daughter, being four, is innocent and just asked what it was. The author's reaction was a joke, but it led to everyone using the cake as playdough, which upset the brother.\n\nNow, the key points here. Was the author's comment intentional? It seems like they just blurted it out without thinking. The author mentions that they've been respecting their brother's dietary choices lately, so maybe this was a slip-up. The daughter's question prompted a spontaneous reaction. However, the result was that the brother's effort was wasted, and he was upset. \n\nThe author feels guilty because they enjoyed making fun of the brother's cake. That guilt is important because it shows they recognize that maybe they overstepped. The brother was proud of his creation, and the family's behavior undermined his effort. Even though the cake looked like Play-Doh, the author's comment set off the chain reaction. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that it was an innocent mistake, especially with a young child involved. The daughter's question was genuine, and the author's response was lighthearted. The family's play was just a fun activity, not a malicious act. But the brother's feelings are valid; he put in work and might have felt disrespected.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while humor can sometimes be a defense, it's important to consider others' feelings. The author's comment, even if a joke, led to the brother's effort being disregarded. There's a balance between fun and respecting others' efforts. The fact that the author feels guilty suggests they see the issue.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might not have intended to be mean, but their actions did cause the brother distress. The key is whether the comment was respectful enough given the brother's pride in his creation. The answer likely leans towards A (in the wrong) because the author's comment, while maybe not malicious, still led to the brother's effort being wasted and caused him upset. The responsibility is on the author to have thought twice before making that comment, especially knowing the brother's pride in his veganism.\n"
