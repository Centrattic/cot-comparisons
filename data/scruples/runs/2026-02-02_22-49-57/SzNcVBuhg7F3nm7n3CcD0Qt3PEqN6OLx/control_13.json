He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, the situation: The brother made a vegan dessert, which the author thought looked and smelled like Play-Doh. The daughter asked what it was, and the author joked that it was Play-Doh. The whole family then played with it, which upset the brother.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author had a history of giving the brother a hard time about his veganism, but recently was being respectful. However, this time, they made a joke that led to the brother's dish being treated as a toy. The brother was not amused, and it ruined the brunch's vegan addition.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, even if they meant it as a joke, the result was that their brother's effort was disrespected. The brother was proud of his creation, and the family's actions probably made him feel disrespected. The author's comment, while maybe innocent, led to a situation where the brother's dessert wasn't eaten as intended. The author might have overstepped, even if it was a light-hearted comment. The daughter was young, so the author should have been more careful with their words to avoid causing harm. Even if the author thought it was funny, the brother's feelings were hurt. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the impact of their joke on their brother and his effort.\n"
