He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the brother made a vegan cake, which looked like Play-Doh to the author. The author then told their daughter it was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, the brother put effort into making the vegan cake, and the author's comment caused it to be treated as a toy. The brother wasn't amused, and the family's brunch was affected. The author says they've been respecting their brother's dietary choices, but this incident might have disrespected the effort he put into the dessert. \n\nThe author's daughter is young, so maybe the comment was made in a playful way without malice. However, the intent might not matter as much as the consequence. The brother's cake was ruined, and he was upset. The author might be guilty of teasing their brother, even if it was a joke. \n\nBut on the other hand, maybe the cake actually did look like Play-Doh, and the author didn't mean harm. However, the fact that the brother was proud of his creation and the family ended up not eating it because of the joke could be seen as dismissive of his effort. \n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling guilty about the fun they had making fun of the cake, which suggests they realize it might have been wrong. The key points here are intent versus impact. Even if the intent was playful, the impact on the brother was negative. So, the author might be in the wrong because they undermined their brother's effort, even if unintentionally.\n"
