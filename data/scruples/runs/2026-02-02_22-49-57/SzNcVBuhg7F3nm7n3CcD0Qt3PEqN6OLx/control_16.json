He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake, and the author joked that it looked like Play-Doh, leading their daughter and the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it. The brother was not amused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother put effort into making a vegan cake for a family event, which is a valid thing to take pride in. The author made a joke about it being Play-Doh, which was probably meant to be lighthearted. But the daughter took it literally, and the family ended up playing with the cake. The brother ended up being upset because his creation wasn't eaten as intended.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the intention was a joke, but the result was that the brother's effort was wasted. The author admits feeling guilty about the fun they had at the brother's expense. The key points here are intent vs. outcome. The author didn't mean to humiliate the brother, but the outcome was that the brother's effort was disrespected in a way. Even if it was a joke, the daughter's literal interpretation led to the family not eating the cake.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had been respecting the brother's dietary choices before. The joke might have been in good fun, but it did cause the brother's dish to be used as a toy. The brother's feelings were hurt, which is a valid point. The author's responsibility here is whether they should have foreseen the child's reaction and the subsequent impact on the brother.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if the joke was well-intentioned, the author didn't consider the possible consequences. The brother's effort was undermined, and the cake wasn't eaten. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they made a comment that led to the brother's dish being treated as a toy instead of food, which could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the initial intent.\n"
