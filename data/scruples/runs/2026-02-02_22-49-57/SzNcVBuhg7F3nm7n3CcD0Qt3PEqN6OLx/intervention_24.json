He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is wrong for making their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, the brother put effort into making a vegan cake, which the author found visually similar to Play-Doh. The author's daughter asked what it was, and the author jokingly called it Play-Doh. This led to the family using the cake as playdough, which upset the brother and ruined the dessert. \n\nThe author mentions they usually respect their brother's dietary choices but have given him a hard time in the past. Now they're feeling guilty about the fun they had at the brother's expense.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, intention matters. The author didn't mean to be malicious, just found it funny. But did they consider the brother's feelings? They might have known the cake was important to him, yet still made a joke that led to the family not eating it. The daughter is four, so her actions were innocent, but the parent's role is to guide her. The author probably should have recognized the brother's pride and not encouraged the mistake. However, the situation was a family gathering, and maybe a bit of harmless fun is acceptable. But the brother was upset, so maybe the author should have been more mindful. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, it was a joke that went too far. On the other, it was a light-hearted moment that might be seen as a family tradition of teasing. However, the brother's effort was disregarded, leading to his disappointment. So, the author might be at fault for not respecting the brother's effort, even if unintentionally.\n"
