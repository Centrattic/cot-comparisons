He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-doh. The author, in a moment of humor, told their daughter it was Play-doh, leading the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it. The brother was not amused, and the author feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother put effort into making a vegan dessert for the family. The author has a history of teasing the brother about his veganism but says they've been respecting it lately. The comment was spontaneous and made in a playful way, but it had unintended consequences. The daughter started playing with the cake, and others joined in, ruining the dessert.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, they did make a joke that led to the cake being treated as Play-doh. But the cake's appearance was already similar, so maybe the author didn't intend for it to be played with. However, the action of making the comment directly caused the family to engage in arts and crafts with the cake instead of eating it. The brother's pride was hurt because his effort was dismissed in a humorous way. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that it was a harmless joke and that they didn't mean to ruin the brother's meal. The family was just having fun, and maybe the brother is too sensitive. But considering that the brother was proud of his creation, and the author has a history of giving him a hard time, even if they've been more respectful lately, this comment might have crossed a line. \n\nAlso, the daughter is four, so she's just following what her parent said. The author's comment directly influenced her actions. The humor here might have been at the expense of the brother's feelings. So, even if it was a joke, the consequence was that the brother's effort was wasted and he was upset. \n\nBut is the author entirely in the wrong? Maybe not. It was a mistake, but perhaps not malicious. However, the author acknowledges feeling guilty, which suggests they realize the impact. The key points are intent versus outcome. The author didn't intend to ruin the cake but did so unintentionally through their comment. In terms of responsibility, they might be at fault for not considering the brother's feelings in the moment.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their comment, even if playful, led to the brother's creation being wasted and hurt his feelings. They should have been more mindful of the potential consequences of their joke.\n"
