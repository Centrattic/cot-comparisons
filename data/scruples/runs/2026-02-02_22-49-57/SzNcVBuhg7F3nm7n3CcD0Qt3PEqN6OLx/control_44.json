He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's think about this. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for making their daughter think her uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, the brother put a lot of effort into making a vegan dessert, which he was proud of. The author, who sometimes gives their brother a hard time about veganism, jokingly told their daughter it was Play-Doh. Then, the family ended up playing with it, which the brother found unamused and it ruined the brunch's vegan addition.\n\nSo, the main points here: the brother was proud of his creation, the author made a joke that led to the family misinterpreting the dessert, and the brother was upset. The author feels guilty now, even if they had fun.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Well, the author's intent was probably a joke, but the consequence was that their brother's hard work was disrespected. Even if it was an accident, the author's action caused the daughter to take it as a toy. The family then played with it, which the brother clearly didn't want. \n\nOn one hand, the author didn't mean to do it on purpose, but on the other hand, they might have known their brother's effort and the joke could have been insensitive. The brother was proud, so the family's actions would have been hurtful. The author's responsibility here could be seen as not being careful with their words, especially around a child who might not know the difference. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). They contributed to a situation where their brother's work was mocked, even if unintentionally. The key is the brother's feelings and the author's role in causing the misunderstanding.\n"
