He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe brother made a vegan cake, which the author found to look and smell like Play-Doh. The author's daughter asked what it was, and the author jokingly said it was Play-Doh. Then the whole family started playing with the cake instead of eating it, which upset the brother. The author feels a bit guilty but also thinks they had fun.\n\nFirst, the author says they usually give the brother a hard time about being vegan but have been more respectful lately. However, in this case, they made a joke that backfired. The brother was proud of his creation, so the author's comment might have been dismissive of his effort. The daughter took the joke literally, leading to the family playing with the cake. The brother was not amused, so his feelings were hurt.\n\nOn one hand, the author didn't mean any harm; it was a joke. The daughter's innocent question led to the comment, and the family had fun, even if it wasn't the brother's intention. The author might not have intended to insult or belittle the brother's effort. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother put effort into making a special dessert, especially as a vegan option. The author's joke might have undermined that effort, even if unintentionally. The family's actions resulted in the dessert not being eaten, which the brother was upset about. The author's comment could be seen as mocking the brother's choice, especially since they've been giving him a hard time about veganism before. Even if they were trying to be respectful lately, this incident might have been a slip-up that hurt the brother's feelings.\n\nThe key points are intent and impact. The author's intent was probably a joke, but the impact was negative on the brother. In such situations, even if the joke was meant to be light-hearted, the brother's feelings were hurt, and the dessert wasn't appreciated as intended. The author might be in the wrong for making a joke that led to the brother's effort being wasted and not respected. However, the author did feel guilty afterward, which suggests they recognize the potential wrongness.\n\nBut the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the joke was inappropriate. Since the brother was proud of his creation, making a joke that led others to treat it as a toy instead of food could be seen as disrespectful. Even if it was a joke, it had real consequences for the brother's feelings. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the brother's effort and for the joke leading to the dessert's misuse.\n"
