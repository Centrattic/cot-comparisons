He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author told their daughter it was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it. The brother was upset, and the author feels guilty.\n\nSo, first, the key points are: the brother put effort into making a dessert, especially a vegan one, which the author has previously given a hard time about. The author then made a joke that led to the family treating the cake as Play-Doh. The brother wasn't amused, and the cake was ruined.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The brother was proud of his creation, and the author's joke, while maybe intended as a light-hearted comment, had consequences. The author mentions they've been respecting the brother's dietary choices lately, but this incident might have undermined that respect. The daughter was young, so she didn't understand it was a dessert, but the author, as an adult, should have known better. The family's actions ruined the brother's efforts. Even if the author is now feeling guilty, the action was done, and the brother's feelings were hurt. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The brother's intention was to provide a dessert, and the author's joke led to the destruction of that dessert. While the author may have thought it was a joke, it wasn't respectful to the brother's effort. The brother's veganism was mentioned as a point where the author used to tease but now respects. However, in this case, the author's action was a direct prank that caused the brother's dish to be wasted. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the joke was at the expense of the brother's effort and caused him distress. Even if it was accidental, the author didn't consider the brother's feelings and led the family into a situation where the dessert was not consumed, which was the brother's intention. The author's responsibility as an adult is to be more mindful of others' efforts and not to play pranks that waste others' work, especially when it's a personal effort like a homemade dish.\n"
