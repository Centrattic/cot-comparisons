He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author made their daughter think her uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The brother was proud of his dessert, but it all went wrong because of the joke.\n\nFirst, I need to consider intent. The author said they've been giving their brother a hard time about his veganism before but have been respectful lately. This time, they just couldn't help but compare the cake to Play-Doh. The key here is whether the joke was malicious or just a slip. Since the author mentions feeling guilty afterward and had fun making fun, maybe there's a mix of intention.\n\nThen, the brother's feelings. He came in beaming with pride, expecting to share his dessert. The family's reaction ruined his creation. Even if the author didn't mean to be mean, the action affected the brother's feelings. The daughter was innocent, but the author's comment triggered the situation.\n\nFamily dynamics matter. The author's brother put effort into making a vegan dessert, which might be important for personal or health reasons. Disrespecting his effort, even jokingly, could hurt him. The author's history of giving the brother a hard time adds context. Maybe there's a pattern of teasing, which could make the situation more problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that it was a harmless joke, and the family had fun. The brother's dessert was vegan, so maybe he didn't mind if it wasn't eaten? But the brother was clearly not amused, which is a key point. The author's guilt suggests they recognize the wrong, even if they enjoyed the moment.\n\nSo, considering the brother's feelings, the effort he put in, and the fact that the joke led to the dessert being ruined without his consent, the author might be in the wrong. Even if it was a joke, it disrespected the brother's effort and caused unintended harm.\n"
