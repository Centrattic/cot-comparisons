He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, the situation: the brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, in a moment of jest, told their daughter it was Play-Doh. The daughter then started playing with it, and the whole family joined in, which upset the brother.\n\nSo, the author is questioning their own actions. They mention they've been respecting their brother's vegan choices lately, but their comment caused a problem. The main issue is whether the author's actions were wrong.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. Was the comment intentional or accidental? The author says they \"blurted out\" the comment, implying it was spontaneous. But even if it was a joke, it led to the family not eating the dessert, which the brother had put effort into. The brother wasn't amused, and it ruined the vegan addition to the brunch.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought it was a harmless joke. On the other hand, the brother had put effort into making a vegan dessert, which the author had previously given him a hard time about. Even if the author meant no harm, the outcome was that the brother's effort was wasted and he was upset.\n\nThe daughter was young and innocent, so maybe the author didn't intend to mock their brother, but the result was that the brother's creation was treated as a toy. The family might not have eaten it because they thought it was Play-Doh, which could be seen as disrespectful to the brother's efforts.\n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling guilty about having fun at the brother's expense. That suggests they recognize something was wrong. Even if the joke was accidental, the author should have considered the brother's feelings and the effort he put into the dessert. They might have been dismissive of his dietary choices, even if they meant to respect them.\n\nIn terms of social norms, making fun of someone's efforts, even if it's a joke, can be hurtful. The author's comment led to a situation where the brother's work was wasted and his pride was hurt. The author's responsibility as a parent to think about the consequences of their actions for their child and others is also a factor here.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author's actions, while perhaps unintentionally malicious, did cause harm and disrespect to their brother's efforts. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
