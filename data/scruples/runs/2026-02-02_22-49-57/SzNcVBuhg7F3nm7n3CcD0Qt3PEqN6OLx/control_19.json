He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-doh. \n\nFirst, the situation: The brother made a vegan cake, which the author found resembled Play-doh. The author, who has a history of teasing the brother about veganism but claims to have been respectful lately, told their daughter it was Play-doh. The daughter and the rest of the family started playing with the cake, which upset the brother and ruined the dessert.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author's comment was a joke, but it led to unintended consequences. The brother was proud of his dessert, and the family's actions prevented him from sharing it as intended. The author might feel guilty because they enjoyed the joke but it hurt the brother's feelings.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, they had a history of teasing, but the brother had been accepted in his choices. The author's comment was a slip of the tongue, perhaps a joke, but it resulted in the brother's hard work being wasted. However, the brother's dessert choice (vegan, mung bean cake) might not be appealing to everyone, so maybe there's some context. But the key here is intent. The author didn't mean to ruin the dessert, but they knew the brother was proud. Telling a child it's Play-doh could lead to that outcome. The author should have considered the potential for the joke to backfire, especially with a child involved. The brother's effort was disregarded, even if it was unintentional. So, the author might be in the wrong for not thinking through the consequences of their joke, especially in a family setting where someone put effort into making something. They should have been more careful with their words to avoid embarrassing their brother. So, the answer is A.\n"
