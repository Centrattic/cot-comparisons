He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the family to use it for crafts instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, who has a history of teasing the brother about veganism, told their daughter it was Play-Doh. The whole family then used it for arts and crafts, which upset the brother and ruined the dessert.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intention, the context of their past behavior, and the impact on the brother. The author mentions they've been respecting the brother's veganism lately, but this time they made a joke. The brother was proud of his creation, and the family's actions made him upset.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The author might argue that it was a harmless joke and that they didn't mean to be malicious. However, the brother was clearly proud of his dessert, and the family's actions disregarded his effort and intention. The daughter is only four, so the author might not have intended any harm, but the result was that the brother's dessert was not eaten and he was upset.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the brother's choice to make a vegan dessert. Maybe the author thinks it's a silly effort, given their history of teasing. However, the brother's pride in his creation is important. The author's comment led to the family not respecting his effort, even if it was unintentional.\n\nOn one hand, the author might not be in the wrong because it was a mistake, and they didn't mean to be hurtful. On the other hand, they should have been more considerate of their brother's feelings and the effort he put into making the dessert. The impact on the brother was significant\u2014his dessert was ruined, and he was upset. The author's history of giving the brother a hard time might add to the issue, even if this time they tried to be respectful.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, did lead to a negative outcome. They should have been more careful with their words, especially knowing their brother's pride in his creation. Even if it was an accident, it's possible they are in the wrong for not foreseeing the consequences and for contributing to the brother's disappointment.\n"
