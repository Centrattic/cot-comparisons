He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake, which looked like Play-Doh. The author told their four-year-old daughter it was Play-Doh, and the whole family ended up playing with it instead of eating it. The brother was upset, and the author feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The author says they've been giving the brother a hard time about his veganism in the past but have been more respectful lately. This time, they just couldn't resist making a joke about the cake looking like Play-Doh. The daughter then took the bait and started playing with it, leading the whole family to join in. The brother was not amused, and the cake was ruined.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the brother put effort into making the cake, expecting it to be eaten. The author's joke led to it being used as a toy, which might be seen as disrespectful, especially considering the brother's pride in his creation. The author acknowledges the brother's effort and feels guilty, which suggests some self-awareness. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't maliciously try to ruin the cake. It was a spontaneous joke, possibly in good humor. The daughter was young, so maybe the author didn't foresee the consequences. However, as a parent, one might be expected to consider how their actions affect others. The brother's feelings were hurt, so there's a breach of respect there. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author has a history of teasing the brother's veganism might play a role. Even if they've been more respectful lately, this incident could be seen as a slip-up that still caused harm. The key here is whether the joke was appropriate. The author's actions, while maybe not malicious, led to the brother's effort being wasted and the family not partaking in the food as intended. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author initiated the joke that led to the family's behavior. Even if others joined in, the author's comment was the catalyst. So, there's some accountability there. The brother's feelings matter, and the author's actions, though maybe not intentional in a harmful way, did cause emotional distress. \n\nTherefore, even if the intention wasn't to hurt, the outcome was negative. The author is in the wrong because they failed to consider the brother's feelings and the effort he put into the cake, and their joke had a harmful consequence.\n"
