He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for accidentally making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to use it for arts and crafts instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, the context is a family Christmas brunch. The brother made a vegan dessert, which the author found looked and smelled like Play-Doh. The daughter asked what it was, and the author, in a moment of humor, said it was Play-Doh. The daughter then started playing with it, and others joined in, which upset the brother. The author feels guilty about not eating the dessert and making fun of it.\n\nThe key points here are intent and the impact. The author says they \"couldn't help it\" and \"blurted out,\" implying it was a spontaneous joke, not a malicious act. They also mention they've been respecting their brother's dietary choices lately. The daughter's innocent question probably triggered a reflexive response. The result was the brother's dessert being used as a toy, which he wasn't amused by, and the author feels guilty.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the joke was meant to mock or belittle their brother's effort, then yes. But the author clarifies they've been respecting their brother's choices, so this might have been a harmless, if misguided, joke. However, the joke had real consequences: the brother's effort was wasted, and the family didn't partake in his creation. The author's guilt suggests they feel responsible for the outcome, even if it was unintentional.\n\nOn one hand, the brother might feel disrespected or that his efforts were trivialized. On the other, the author's response was a momentary lapse in judgment without malice. The daughter's innocent action spiraled into a family activity, which might have been a happy accident, but it did ruin the brother's plan. The author's humor might have been inappropriate in that context, especially given the effort the brother put in.\n\nBut considering the author's intent wasn't to hurt, and the situation was accidental, some might say it's not the author's fault. However, the impact is real. The brother might feel that even a joke about his food undermines his efforts. The line between a joke and disrespect can be thin here. \n\nIn some cultures or families, teasing about food or dietary choices might be common, while in others, it's offensive. The author's brother could be sensitive about his veganism, making the joke hurtful. The author's guilt indicates they recognize the brother's feelings, which suggests they care. But whether they're in the wrong depends on the family dynamics and the brother's perspective. \n\nOverall, while the author might not have intended harm, their actions did cause the brother distress. So, there's a case for them being in the wrong for not respecting the brother's effort, even if it was a joke. Alternatively, if the family is generally playful, it might not be the author's fault. Without more context on the brother's feelings, it's hard to say, but the author's reaction shows they acknowledge the potential wrongness.\n"
