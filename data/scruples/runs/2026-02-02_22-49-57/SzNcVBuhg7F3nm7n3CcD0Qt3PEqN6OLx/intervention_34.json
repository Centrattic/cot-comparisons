He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh. The situation is that the brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh, the author joked about it, and the family ended up playing with it instead of eating it. The brother was upset because it ruined his special dish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they've been giving the brother a hard time about his veganism in the past but have been respecting it lately. This time, they joked without intending to mock. The brother was proud of his creation, so the joke might have backfired. The family's actions led to the cake not being eaten, which could be seen as disrespectful to the brother's effort.\n\nBut the author's intention was playful, not malicious. The daughter was young and just reacting. The humor might have been a way to bond with the child, but it inadvertently caused the uncle's dish to be treated as a toy. The key points are intent vs. impact. The author didn't mean to hurt the uncle's feelings, but the outcome was negative. \n\nIn such cases, cultural norms and family dynamics matter. If the family is generally playful and understanding, maybe it's a minor issue. However, the uncle put effort into making a special dessert, and the joke undermined that. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the uncle's feelings and the effort he put in, even if it was a joke. \n\nBut on the other hand, the uncle might have presented the cake in a way that looked like Play-Doh, so maybe the author's reaction was a natural one. However, the author had the responsibility to not mislead the child into thinking it was a toy. So, the guilt is partly on the author for not correcting the child immediately and allowing the family to play with the cake instead of eating it. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions had unintended consequences, but the intent wasn't malicious. However, the outcome was harmful to the uncle's feelings. So, maybe the answer is that the author is somewhat in the wrong because they didn't take responsibility for their actions, even if they were in good faith.\n"
