He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, who has a history of teasing their brother about veganism, told their daughter it was Play-Doh. The whole family then used the cake as an art material, which upset the brother. The author feels guilty because they enjoyed mocking their brother's effort.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key points here are intent, respect, and the impact on the brother. The author's comment was a joke, not a malicious intent to ruin the cake. However, they did have a history of giving their brother a hard time about his veganism. Even though they mentioned they've been respecting it lately, this incident might show they still don't take it seriously. The brother was proud of his creation, and the family's actions likely embarrassed him and made him feel disrespected. \n\nBut then again, the daughter is four years old, and the comment was innocent. The author didn't plan for the entire family to play with the cake. It might have been a well-meaning mistake, especially since they felt guilty afterward. The brother's cake was not eaten, which could be a problem if he put a lot of effort into it. However, the family's reaction was spontaneous and playful, not malicious.\n\nConsidering cultural context, teasing within families can be common, but when it comes to someone's personal efforts and values, it can cross a line. The brother's veganism is a personal choice, and the family's actions might have undermined his effort. The author's history of teasing might contribute to the brother's hurt feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that it was a harmless mistake, especially with a young child involved. They also mentioned they respected the brother's choices lately. The family's actions, while unintended, led to a fun activity, and maybe the brother could have explained the cake's purpose better. But since he was proud of it, he probably expected it to be eaten, not played with.\n\nI think the line between a joke and disrespect is thin here. The author's comment, though not malicious, led to unintended harm. The brother's feelings were hurt, and the cake wasn't used as intended. So the author is partially at fault for not considering how their joke might affect their brother. Even if it was an accident, they should have been more careful given their history.\n"
