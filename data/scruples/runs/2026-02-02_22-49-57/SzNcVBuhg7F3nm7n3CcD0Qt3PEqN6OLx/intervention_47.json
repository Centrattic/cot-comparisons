He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, who has a history of teasing the brother about veganism but has been more respectful lately, calls it Play-Doh to their daughter. The daughter then starts playing with it, and the whole family joins in, which upsets the brother and ruins his dessert.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author's comment was a joke, but it had consequences. The brother put effort into making the cake, and the family's actions prevented him from having his creation enjoyed. The author feels guilty about the fun they had at the brother's expense.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Intention is key. The author didn't mean to be malicious, just made a joke based on the cake's appearance. However, they should have considered the impact. Even if it was accidental, the result was that the brother's effort was wasted. The author's history of teasing might add context\u2014though they've been more respectful, this incident might be a slip-up.\n\nBut then again, the brother's cake looked like Play-Doh, which is a funny resemblance. The daughter was young and innocent, so the author's reaction might be seen as playful. However, the author should have anticipated that their comment could lead to the family not eating the cake. They might not be in the wrong if it was an innocent mistake, but they definitely could have been more considerate.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother is a consenting adult and chose to make a cake that resembles Play-Doh. Maybe he should have considered how it might be perceived. But the fact that he was proud of it and the family's actions ruined it suggests that the author's joke crossed a line, even if unintentionally.\n\nI think there's a mix of factors here. The author didn't mean to harm, but their action did cause harm. So there's some responsibility. But since it was a joke and not malicious, maybe they aren't entirely in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer would depend on whether the joke was inconsiderate. Since the author felt guilty, maybe they are not in the wrong, but they should apologize to make things right.\n"
