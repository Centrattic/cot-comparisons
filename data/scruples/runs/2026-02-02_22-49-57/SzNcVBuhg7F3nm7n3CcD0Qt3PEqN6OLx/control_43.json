He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the brother made a vegan cake, which he was proud of. The author, who's been giving the brother a hard time about his veganism in the past, but recently been more respectful, saw the cake and thought it looked like Play-Doh. In front of their daughter, the author told her it was Play-Doh. The daughter then started playing with it, and the whole family joined in, turning the dessert into an arts and crafts activity. The brother was upset, and the author feels guilty about it now.\n\nHmm. The author's intention might be part of this. They said they've been respecting their brother's dietary choices lately, so maybe they didn't mean to be malicious. But they still made a joke that led to the family not eating the dessert. The brother put effort into making the cake, and the family's actions probably felt dismissive or disrespectful to him, even if it was a joke. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have thought it was a harmless joke, especially since they mentioned the cake looked and smelled like Play-Doh. The daughter was only four, so her reaction was innocent. But the family's participation in using it as playdough could have caused embarrassment or frustration for the brother. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the joke was inconsiderate. The brother was trying to contribute something meaningful to the brunch. The author's initial habit of teasing about veganism might have influenced this incident, even if they've been trying to be respectful. The brother might have felt his efforts were not valued, and the author's comment led to that. So, even if it was an accident, maybe the author should have been more careful. \n\nBut maybe it was just a misunderstanding, not on purpose. The author didn't intend to make fun of the brother's veganism but just saw the cake and made a joke. Still, the outcome was negative, and the author is now feeling guilty. \n\nIn AITA situations, the key is intention vs. impact. If the author didn't mean to be mean but the action had a negative effect, they might not be entirely in the wrong. However, if the author's comment, even if not malicious, consistently pokes fun at their brother's choice, that could be seen as wrong. But the user said they've been cool with it lately. \n\nSo maybe the author is not in the wrong (B) because it was an honest mistake and the family was just having fun. But the brother was proud of his creation, so the author's comment trivialized his effort. That could make the author at least partially responsible. \n\nAlternatively, if the cake genuinely looked like Play-Doh, maybe the author's reaction was just a natural one. But the problem is the daughter believed it and others followed, leading to the uncle's dessert being ruined. \n\nIn the end, the author's guilt suggests they think they did something wrong. The family might not have intended to disrespect, but the impact on the brother was negative. So, maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong for making the comment that led to the family not respecting the uncle's effort. Or maybe B, since it was an accident. \n\nI'm a bit torn. But considering that the brother was proud and the author's comment led to the family not eating the cake, the author should have been more careful. Even if it was a joke, it's important to respect others' efforts. So maybe A is the right choice here.\n"
