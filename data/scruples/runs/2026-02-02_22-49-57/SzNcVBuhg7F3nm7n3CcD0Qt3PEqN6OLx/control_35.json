He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother made a vegan cake as a special effort for the family brunch. The author, who usually gives the brother a hard time about his veganism but has been more respectful recently, made a joke that led the family to treat the cake as Play-Doh. The brother was upset, and the cake was ruined.\n\nSo, the key points are: the brother put effort into making the cake, the author's comment led to the family not eating it, and the brother was upset. The author feels guilty because they enjoyed making fun of their brother's effort.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the brother's intention was to have the cake eaten, not played with. The author's actions, even if unintentional, prevented that. The joke was in bad taste, even if it was a mistake. The family's actions, based on the author's comment, wasted the brother's effort and hurt his feelings. The author's guilt suggests they know they did something wrong. However, the author might argue it was a harmless mistake. But considering the effort and the brother's pride, the author's responsibility is there. The answer is likely A (yes), because they caused the brother's dish to be disrespected, even if unintentionally.\n"
