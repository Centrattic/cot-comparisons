He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The brother made a vegan cake, which looked like Play-Doh. The author, who has a history of teasing their brother about veganism, joked that it was Play-Doh to their daughter. The family ended up playing with the cake, which upset the brother.\n\nThe key points here are intent and the outcome. The author didn't mean to ruin the brunch but made a joke that led to unintended consequences. The brother was proud of his creation, so having it treated as a toy instead of being eaten could be hurtful. The author admits to feeling guilty, which suggests they recognize the potential wrongdoing.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect that the author had been respecting their brother's dietary choices lately. The joke was a slip, maybe a moment of humor that backfired. But the main issue is that the author's words started a chain reaction that disrespected the brother's effort.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's action (the initial joke) directly led to the family playing with the cake. Even if it was a joke, they should have considered the brother's feelings and the effort he put into making the dessert. The fact that the family joined in doesn't entirely absolve the author, since they were the one who started it.\n\nSo, while it might not be malicious, the author's actions did cause their brother distress and disrespected his contribution to the brunch. That would make the author at least partially at fault. However, some might argue it was a harmless mistake, but given the brother's feelings, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
