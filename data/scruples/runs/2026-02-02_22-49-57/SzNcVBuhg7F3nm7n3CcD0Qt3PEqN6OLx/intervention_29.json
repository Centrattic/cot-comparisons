He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother made a vegan cake, which the author found resembled Play-Doh. The author's daughter asked what it was, and the author joked that it was Play-Doh. Then the family ended up playing with the cake instead of eating it, which upset the brother.\n\nThe key points here are intent and impact. The author didn't mean to be cruel, but their comment led to the brother's creation being treated as a toy. The brother was proud of his dessert, and the joke backfired, causing hurt feelings. The author feels guilty now.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's comment was a joke, but they should have been more considerate of the brother's feelings and the effort he put into making the cake. Even if it was a family event, the joke might have been in poor taste, especially with a young child involved. The outcome ruined the brother's contribution, which could be seen as dismissive of his efforts.\n\nHowever, the author didn't have malicious intent. They were making a light-hearted comment, and the family's reaction was unexpected. The daughter's innocence played a role, and the author might not have anticipated the extent of the brother's pride in the dessert.\n\nBut in terms of responsibility, the author's action (the joke) directly led to the situation. Even if it was a joke, they should have considered the potential consequences on their brother's feelings. So, the author might be at least partially at fault here. But maybe not entirely in the wrong. It's a tricky situation because humor can sometimes backfire.\n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole?) threads, the community often looks at intent versus the harm caused. If the harm was significant, even with good intentions, the person might still be considered in the wrong. Here, the brother was not too amused, and it ruined his addition to the brunch. The author enjoyed making fun of it, which adds another layer.\n\nThe author's defense is that they were respecting the brother's dietary choices but still made a joke. The line between respectful teasing and being dismissive can be thin. Since the brother was proud of his dessert, the joke undermined that pride.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but maybe there's some nuance. However, given the brother's effort and the outcome, the author's joke was inappropriate despite not being malicious. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
