He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother making a vegan cake that looks like Play-Doh, and the narrator's comment to their daughter leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother put effort into making a vegan dessert, which was his way of contributing to the brunch. The narrator, who usually gives the brother a hard time about his veganism but has been more respectful lately, made a joke that led the family to treat the cake as Play-Doh. The daughter started playing with it, and others joined in, which ruined the brother's dessert and his pride.\n\nThe question is whether the narrator is in the wrong. The brother might feel disrespected, especially since he was proud of his creation. The narrator's comment, even if a joke, could be seen as mocking the brother's effort. However, the narrator mentions that they usually respect the brother's dietary choices now. The family ended up having fun, but the brother was not amused.\n\nOn the other hand, the joke might not have been malicious. The narrator thought the cake looked like Play-Doh, and the daughter's innocent question led to the comment. The family's actions were playful, but it's possible that the brother's feelings were hurt. The narrator feels guilty about the fun they had at the brother's expense.\n\nI think the key here is the impact on the brother. Even if the intention wasn't to mock, the result was that the dessert wasn't eaten and the brother was upset. Respect in a family setting often involves considering others' feelings. The narrator might have overstepped by making a joke that led to the brother's dish being treated as a toy. So, the answer might be that the narrator is in the wrong because their actions, even if well-intentioned, caused the brother distress.\n"
