He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, the situation: The brother made a vegan cake, which looked and smelled like Play-Doh to the author. The author then told their four-year-old daughter it was Play-Doh, and the whole family ended up using it for arts and crafts, which upset the brother and ruined his dessert.\n\nSo, considering the context. The author mentions they usually give their brother a hard time about his veganism but have been respectful lately. However, in this case, they made a joke that led to the whole family playing with the cake instead of eating it. The brother was not amused, and the dessert was ruined. The author feels guilty about the fun they had at the brother's expense.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are intent, knowledge of the brother's feelings about his creation, and the consequences. The author did not mean to ruin the dessert, but their comment was the catalyst for the family's actions. The daughter is only four, so she wouldn't understand the significance of the dessert. However, the author should have been more aware of the brother's feelings. Even though the author has been respectful of the brother's dietary choices, making a joke that leads to the destruction of his carefully made dessert could be seen as disrespectful or dismissive of his efforts. The author's comment, while perhaps intended as a light-hearted joke, had real consequences for the brother, who was proud of his creation. The author enjoyed the situation, which might indicate a lack of empathy towards the brother's feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that it was a mistake, a momentary lapse in judgment, and that they didn't intend to cause harm. The outcome was accidental, especially with a young child involved. However, the responsibility lies with the parent to consider the impact of their words. The brother's dessert was ruined, and the family's enjoyment of the meal was affected. The author's actions, even if unintentional, led to a negative outcome, so there's some accountability here. The key is whether the author should have foreseen that the comment could lead to the dessert being ruined. Given that they made a joke about the appearance, it's plausible they didn't anticipate the family would play with it, but they should have considered the brother's feelings. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their actions, though not malicious, disregarded the brother's efforts and caused harm.\n"
