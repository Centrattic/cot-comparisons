He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, the context: the brother made a vegan cake, which the author found looked and smelled like Play-Doh. The daughter asked what it was, and the author jokingly said it was Play-Doh. The whole family ended up using it for arts and crafts, which upset the brother because it ruined his dessert.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are intent and the impact. The author admits they have a history of teasing their brother about veganism but have been respectful recently. In this case, the comment was spontaneous and made in a playful manner, not with malicious intent. However, the brother was proud of his creation, and the joke backfired, causing his dessert to be wasted. The family joined in, but the brother was not amused.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's intent was likely a joke, but the outcome caused their brother distress. Even if the intention wasn't malicious, the result was that the brother's effort was wasted. The author might be responsible for not considering the brother's feelings in the moment. However, there's also the argument that it was an innocent mistake, and the brother could be more resilient. \n\nBut in terms of accountability, the author's joke led to the family not consuming the dessert, which the brother had prepared with pride. While the author might not have intended harm, the action did cause harm to the brother's feelings. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong for not foreseeing the consequences and for not respecting the brother's effort, even if the initial comment was a joke.\n"
