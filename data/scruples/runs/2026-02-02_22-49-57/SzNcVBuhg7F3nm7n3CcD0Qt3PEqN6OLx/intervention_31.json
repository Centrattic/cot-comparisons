He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for accidentally making their daughter think her uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The brother made a vegan cake, and the author joked that it looked like Play-Doh. The daughter took it seriously, and the whole family ended up using it for arts and crafts. The brother was upset because his creation was ruined.\n\nThe author mentions that while they've been respectful of their brother's veganism lately, they've also given him a hard time before. The key points here are intent and the outcome. The author's comment was a joke, not a malicious intent to mock. The daughter's innocent question led to the joke being taken literally. The family's actions were playful but unintended.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be seen as responsible for making the joke that led to the misunderstanding. However, the main fault might lie more with the family acting on the joke without realizing the consequences. The brother's feelings are hurt because his effort was wasted, but the author's actions were not in bad faith.\n\nConsidering the context, the author's actions were a joke that had unintended consequences. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong. If the joke was meant to be playful and there was no intent to harm, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, the outcome did cause the brother distress, so there's some responsibility there.\n\nI think the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the joke was a mistake and they felt guilty about it. The main issue is the accidental nature of the misunderstanding rather than malicious intent.\n"
