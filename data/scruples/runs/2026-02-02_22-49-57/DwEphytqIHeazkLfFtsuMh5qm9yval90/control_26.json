She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a deli counter interaction where the customer ends up leaving without resolving the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee made a mistake, charging $6.98/lb instead, and gave over a pound. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee acknowledged the price error but then tried to adjust the weight by taking out meat and rebagging it. The customer was upset, left without finishing the interaction.\n\nNow, considering the actions of both parties. The employee made an error, which is understandable. But the customer's reaction was to leave abruptly without resolving it. The key points here are: did the customer handle it appropriately?\n\nThe customer did attempt to correct the error politely initially. The employee then tried to fix it by removing some meat. The customer, however, seemed to get frustrated and left. The question is whether leaving without further action is wrong. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the customer has a right to correct pricing errors and ensure they're charged correctly. However, walking out might leave the employee in a difficult spot, but the customer could have either spoken to a manager or returned later. The employee might have been overpowered by the situation, but the customer's frustration is also valid given the price discrepancy.\n\nThe main issue is whether the customer's reaction was justified. They did try to address it, but when the employee's response didn't satisfy them, they left. The employee's actions (taking out the meat, rebagging) might not have resolved the customer's concern if the final weight still didn't match the original request. However, the customer could have been more patient or found another way to resolve it rather than exiting.\n\nSo, is the customer in the wrong? They didn't attack or yell, but they walked out without resolving the issue. The answer might depend on cultural norms and what's considered acceptable. In many cases, customers are expected to handle such issues by escalating if necessary. However, the customer's frustration is understandable, and the employee's confusion could have been a factor. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (No), because the customer did attempt to address the issue, and while leaving abruptly isn't ideal, the employee's actions might have been confusing, leading to the customer's loss of patience. The customer isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to just get their correct purchase, and the employee's mistake is the root cause here.\n"
