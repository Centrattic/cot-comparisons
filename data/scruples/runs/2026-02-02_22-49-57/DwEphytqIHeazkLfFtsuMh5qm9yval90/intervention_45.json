She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused after a pricing and weight issue. The situation is a bit tense.\n\nSo, the author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of oven roasted turkey meat at $3.98 per pound, thinly sliced. The girl sliced the meat and asked if it's okay if it's a little over. The author agreed. Then the bag says 1.745 lbs at $6.98, which is way more expensive. The author points out the mistake, the employee says the price increased but the sign wasn't updated. The author then explains the weight, the employee takes out the meat, adds a few slices, then puts 2 slices and half another on the scale. The author, frustrated, puts the basket down and leaves without paying. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, the employee made a mistake in both weight and price. The author caught the weight issue because the amount was over a pound. The employee tried to correct it but maybe not accurately. The author was polite initially but got irritated. When the employee started rebagging, the author walked out. \n\nThe key points: Did the author have a valid reason to be upset? The employee was incorrect about the price and the weight. The author was within their rights to challenge the mistake. But then, when the employee was trying to fix it, the author left. Was that right?\n\nLeaving without paying could be considered wrong because the author didn't complete the transaction. Even if they were frustrated, not paying is theft. They should have either waited for the correction or left the item for someone else. \n\nOn the other hand, the employee made an error, which is the store's fault. The author was trying to correct it but got fed up. However, the action of leaving without paying crosses a line. The correct response would be to mention the error to a manager or leave the item, not take it and walk out without paying. \n\nSo, the author is probably in the wrong because they didn't pay. Even if the employee was unhelpful, they should have found a proper resolution instead of abandoning the item and leaving. Employees make mistakes, and the customer's responsibility is to address it correctly. The author's frustration is understandable, but not paying makes them the asshole.\n"
