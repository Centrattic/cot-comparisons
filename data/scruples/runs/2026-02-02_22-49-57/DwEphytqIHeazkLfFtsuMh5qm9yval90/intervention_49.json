She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without saying a word. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of oven-roasted turkey at $3.98 per pound. The deli employee started slicing and asked if it being a little over was okay. The customer agreed. Then the employee gave them 1.745 lbs but charged $6.98 per pound, which is double the price the customer thought. The customer pointed out the mistake, and the employee said the price had gone up but the sign wasn't updated. When the customer mentioned the weight being over a pound, the employee seemed confused, even asking where it says the weight. The author got irritated, and the employee then started re-slicing the meat in a way that looked rushed and inefficient, tearing slices and putting them on the scale. The author then just left without finishing the interaction.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the employee made a pricing error, possibly miscommunicated the price change, and then handled the correction in a confusing or unprofessional manner. The customer, frustrated by the employee's response and the incorrect pricing, decided to leave instead of escalating the issue.\n\nI need to consider if the customer's actions are justified. The customer was polite initially, pointed out the mistake, and the employee's response was unclear. The employee then tried to reprocess the order in a way that the customer found unsatisfactory. The customer's decision to leave could be seen as a reaction to poor service and not wanting to argue further. However, leaving without completing the transaction might be abrupt, but in some contexts, if the service is problematic, it's reasonable to walk away. The customer might also feel that the employee was not addressing the issue properly, leading to frustration and the decision to leave. \n\nOn the other hand, the customer could have asked to speak to a manager or at least informed the employee they weren't proceeding with the purchase. But given the tone of the story, the customer was already stressed and wanted to avoid conflict. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the customer isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were trying to get a correct order and were met with confusion and possibly incorrect handling. The employee's mistake led to the situation. The customer's frustration is understandable, and walking out in a stressful situation is a possible reaction. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
