She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused after a pricing and weight issue. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author goes to the deli, asks for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gives them 1.745 lbs but charges $6.98/lb. The author points out the discrepancy, the employee says the price went up but didn't update the sign. The author points out the weight is over a pound, the employee asks where it says that, and then proceeds to take the meat, cut slices, and rebag it to make it exactly the right weight. The author then leaves without saying a word.\n\nSo, the author is questioning if they were wrong to just walk out. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let's consider both sides. The employee made a mistake in pricing and weight. The author tried to correct it politely. The employee was dismissive, didn't acknowledge the issues, and then tried to fix the weight by cutting the slices, which might not be accurate. The author, frustrated, left without further confrontation.\n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, they were trying to correct the error. The employee's behavior was unhelpful. Maybe the author could have asked to speak to a manager, but they didn't want to cause a scene. Walking out to avoid conflict isn't necessarily wrong. The key points are the employee's mistakes and their dismissive attitude. The author's reaction, while abrupt, is understandable given the employee's lack of cooperation. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
