She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where there was a pricing mistake.\n\nFirst, the author went to buy 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli worker gave them 1.745lbs but charged $6.98/lb. The author pointed out the mistake and was told the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. The author was supposed to get a pound, but got almost two, so they were confused and frustrated when the worker tried to fix it by taking out the meat, using only 2 slices and half of another. The author left without saying a word, feeling angry and not wanting to deal with the employee further.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the employee made a pricing error, the author noticed and tried to correct it, the employee was uncooperative and tried to charge more, leading to the author losing patience and leaving.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author tried to resolve the issue politely at first. When the employee was unresponsive and started rebagging the product in a way the author found unhelpful, the author left. While not saying a word might be seen as abrupt, the situation was clearly a mistake. The author was justified in pointing out the error. The employee's behavior (not acknowledging the correct weight, not properly resolving the issue) likely contributed to the author's frustration. The author's choice to walk out rather than escalate to the manager could be seen as a personal choice, but not necessarily in the wrong. The store made a mistake, and the author was trying to correct it. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
