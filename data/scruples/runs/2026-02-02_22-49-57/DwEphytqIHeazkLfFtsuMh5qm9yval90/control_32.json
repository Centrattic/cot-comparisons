She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a deli counter where the customer ends up with a much more expensive and heavier package of turkey than expected. The employee made a mistake, right? The customer points out the price discrepancy and the weight being over a pound. The employee says the price increased but didn't update the sign, which is probably why the customer was confused.\n\nThe customer tried to correct the weight, but the employee didn't seem to handle it well. Then, the employee took the meat, put in only a few slices to make it under a pound, and tried to charge the higher price. The customer got really frustrated and left without saying anything else. The question is whether the customer (the author) is the asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the employee's actions. If the employee made a mistake in pricing and weight, the customer has a right to point that out. However, the employee's response seems to be that the price went up, so they might be trying to charge more, but the original order was for $3.98/lb. The customer is correct in pointing out the weight is over a pound and the price is wrong. \n\nNow, the employee starts rebagging the meat by taking only a few slices and tearing them to make it under a pound. That seems like an attempt to fix the problem by reducing the weight to match the original request, but the customer is upset that the employee is being inconsistent. The customer might feel that the employee is trying to charge them more without proper explanation, and when the employee tries to correct it, they do it in a way that's not satisfactory.\n\nThe customer's reaction was to walk out. They were irritated and didn't want to deal with it. But did they have the right to leave without resolving the issue? Technically, the customer is a paying customer and can choose to walk away, but in a situation like this, it's usually expected to either resolve the issue (like talking to the manager) or at least communicate. However, the employee's behavior might have been the main cause of the conflict. \n\nThe employee didn't handle the situation correctly. They should have apologized for the mistake, corrected the price, and maybe even offered a discount. Instead, they tried to repackage the meat in a way that might have been confusing or even deceptive. The customer, frustrated by the employee's handling, decided to leave. \n\nSo, is the customer in the wrong? Probably not. The employee made a mistake and didn't handle it professionally. The customer was within their rights to point out the error and ask for a correction. The customer's frustration is understandable given the employee's lack of cooperation. Walking out might not be the best solution, but it's a valid reaction to a stressful situation. The main issue lies with the employee's poor customer service. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
