She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused. The situation involves a pricing error and the customer's reaction.\n\nFirst, the deli employee made a mistake with the price and weight. The customer pointed out the error, which is reasonable. The employee's response, saying the price increased but the sign wasn't updated, might be a problem if it's a lie. However, the employee could be mistaken or there could be a system error.\n\nThe customer asked about the weight being over a pound, and the employee didn't correct that but instead tried to fix it by reducing the amount. The customer then left without speaking further. The key points are whether the customer had a right to be upset and if their reaction was excessive.\n\nThe customer was polite initially. The employee's actions, like tearing meat and not properly addressing the issue, might have escalated the situation. The customer's decision to leave quickly could be seen as justified if they felt the employee was being dishonest or unhelpful. However, not engaging further might be seen as abrupt. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the customer isn't at fault for pointing out the mistake. The employee's handling of the situation could be at fault. The customer's final action was to leave, which might be a valid choice if they felt their time was being wasted or the employee was being uncooperative. \n\nSo, the answer is B; the author isn't in the wrong. They tried to resolve it politely, and the employee's actions likely contributed to the customer's frustration.\n"
