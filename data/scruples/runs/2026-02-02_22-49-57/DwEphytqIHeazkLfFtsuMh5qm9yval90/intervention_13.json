She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer gets charged more than expected. \n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb of oven roasted turkey at $3.98 per pound. The deli employee started slicing and said it might be a bit over. But when the customer checked, the weight was 1.745 lbs and the price was $6.98 per pound, totaling $12.18. The customer pointed out the discrepancy, and the employee responded that the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then the customer said they wanted a pound, but the employee took the meat back, asked where it says that, and then put only a few slices into a new bag, cutting one in half to reach the weight.\n\nThe customer then left without saying anything, feeling irritated. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to figure out if the customer's actions are justified.\n\nThe employee made a mistake in pricing and weight. The customer politely tried to address it. The employee was unhelpful, didn't acknowledge the customer's point about the weight, and just tried to correct it in a way that seems confusing (putting only a few slices into the new bag, which might be a different type or price). The customer lost patience and left. \n\nIs the customer in the wrong? Well, they were a bit abrupt in leaving but they had a right to be upset. The employee was uncooperative and didn't resolve the issue properly. The customer didn't escalate to a manager, which is a valid step, but they felt it wasn't worth the hassle. The main question is if the customer was wrong to walk out. Considering the employee's unprofessional behavior and failure to address the mistake, the customer's reaction seems reasonable. They were polite, noticed the error, and left to avoid a confrontation. So, answer B (No).\n"
