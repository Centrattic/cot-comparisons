She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused and without explaining their actions.\n\nFirst, the main points: The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee tried to justify it by saying the price increased but didn't change the sign. The customer was annoyed and walked out without speaking further.\n\nSo, the key issues here are: Did the customer act appropriately when facing a pricing error? The customer tried to correct the weight and price, the employee didn't listen, and after the employee messed with the meat (tearing slices), the customer left in frustration.\n\nFrom the customer's perspective, they were being overcharged. The employee didn't correct the mistake initially and then handled the meat in a way that might have ruined it for the customer. The customer's reaction was to walk out, which can be seen as impolite, but maybe justified given the employee's unhelpful behavior.\n\nBut the question is if the customer is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no). \n\nThe employee made a pricing error, and the customer tried to address it. However, when the employee didn't correct it, the customer left. The customer didn't escalate to a manager, which might be the proper step. But the employee's actions (tearing meat, not listening) could have pushed the customer to their limit. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, people often debate whether leaving without further action is rude, especially if the employee is left confused. However, if the employee was at fault, the customer isn't necessarily in the wrong. The customer's frustration is understandable, but walking out without a word could be seen as abrupt. \n\nBut considering the employee's behavior\u2014arguing over the weight, changing the product's integrity by tearing slices\u2014it's possible the customer had enough and decided not to engage further. The customer might not be in the wrong because the employee was uncooperative and made a mess of the transaction. \n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). The employee made mistakes and was dismissive, leading the customer to leave in frustration. The customer's actions, while abrupt, are a reasonable response to the employee's handling of the situation.\n"
