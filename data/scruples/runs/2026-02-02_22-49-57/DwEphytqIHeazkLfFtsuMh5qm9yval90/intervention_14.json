She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter where there was a pricing and weight mistake. The author left without saying anything after getting a pile of meat.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee gave them 1.745 lbs but charged $6.98 per pound, which is higher. The author pointed out the mistake, the employee said the price had gone up but hadn't updated the sign. Then the employee took the meat back, tried to re-weigh and repackage it, but the author got frustrated and left.\n\nSo, the main points here are whether the author was wrong to leave without resolving the issue. The employee made a mistake, both in pricing and weight. The author was polite, pointed out the error, and the employee was dismissive. The author felt they couldn't handle the situation and left. \n\nI need to consider if the author is at fault. The author did try to resolve it politely. The employee was possibly incorrect in their handling (maybe the price didn't actually go up, or the weight was miscalculated). The author's reaction of losing patience and leaving might be seen as impolite, but given the employee's dismissive attitude, maybe it's understandable. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I should check if there's any obligation to stay and escalate the issue. The author could have asked to speak to a manager, but they didn't want to be a problem. However, leaving without saying anything might leave the employee in a worse spot, but the author's frustration is valid. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the error was on the store's side. The author was a customer being overcharged. The employee's response was unhelpful. The author's reaction, while abrupt, is not entirely wrong because they were trying to get their due. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
