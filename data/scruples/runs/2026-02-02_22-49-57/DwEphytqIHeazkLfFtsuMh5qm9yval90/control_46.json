She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict at a deli counter where a price discrepancy occurs.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave 1.745 lbs but charged $6.98/lb. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee initially denied it, then tried to fix it by cutting the meat into smaller slices. The customer left in frustration without resolving it.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The customer is justified in noticing the price difference and pointing out the error. The employee made a mistake, maybe in pricing or weighing. However, the customer left abruptly without trying to resolve it further. Was that wrong?\n\nThe customer didn't get the correct amount or price they were promised. The employee's response was unhelpful and incorrect. The customer's frustration is understandable given the employee's confusion and incorrect actions. However, leaving without completing the transaction might be seen as not giving the employee a chance to correct it properly. But considering the employee's actions (like cutting slices and reweighing), maybe the customer felt it was hopeless. \n\nLegally, the customer has a right to the correct price. Ethically, the customer might not be in the wrong for standing up for themselves. The employee's mistake was significant, and the customer's frustration is valid. So, the answer is probably B, the customer isn't in the wrong.\n"
