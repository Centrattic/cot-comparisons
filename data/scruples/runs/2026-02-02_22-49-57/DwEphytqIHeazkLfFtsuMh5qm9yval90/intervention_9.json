She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused with the meat. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745 lbs at $6.98/lb. The author noticed the discrepancy, pointed it out, and the employee was confused. The employee then tried to fix it by taking the meat, but the author left in frustration.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is correct in pointing out the price discrepancy. The employee might have made a mistake, either in pricing or in the amount given. The author's frustration is understandable because they were charged more than the listed price and got more meat than requested. \n\nWhen the employee starts rebagging, the author is described as \"looking through her dead eyes\" and walking out. The author admits to losing patience and not wanting to deal with the manager. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did point out the mistake politely at first. The employee might have been confused or made an error. The author's reaction of walking out could be seen as abrupt. However, the employee was already causing confusion and the author was stressed. \n\nBut maybe there's a way to handle it more calmly. Instead of walking out, perhaps they could have asked to speak to a manager or left the items there. But the author did return the item and left it with the employee, so the employee was left with the pile. \n\nThe employee might have been in a tough spot, but the author's actions could have been more patient. However, the situation was frustrating, and the author did attempt to resolve it before leaving. \n\nSo, considering the employee's mistake and the author's attempt to correct it, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But their method of leaving without a word might be seen as rude. However, given the confusion and the employee's own mistakes, maybe the author's actions are justified. \n\nThe answer is B.\n"
