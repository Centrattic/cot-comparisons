She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without saying a word. The story is about a customer who goes to the deli to get 1 lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee gives them 1.745 lbs but charges $6.98 per pound, which is way more expensive. The customer points out the mistake, the employee gets defensive, and the customer leaves in frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the customer acted appropriately. The key points here are the price discrepancy and the employee's response. The customer asked for a specific amount and price, and the employee provided a different amount and charged a higher rate. The customer politely pointed out the mistake, but the employee didn't immediately correct it and instead asked where the mistake was, leading to the customer's irritation. The employee then tried to repackage the meat with only a few slices, which might not add up to the correct weight or price.\n\nThe customer's reaction was to leave without saying anything else. They mention they were irritated and didn't want to escalate by asking for a manager. The question is whether this response is acceptable or if the customer was wrong to walk out. \n\nFrom a consumer rights perspective, the customer was right to notice the pricing error. However, the appropriate action usually involves trying to resolve the issue, like speaking to a manager. The employee's behavior seems unhelpful and possibly incorrect in their job duties. The customer might have felt that the employee was not addressing the issue properly, leading to their frustration. \n\nBut was the customer in the wrong by leaving without further communication? Walking out can be seen as abrupt and possibly impolite, even if the employee was at fault. The customer might have been justified in their frustration, but not addressing it could leave the employee confused and the store with an incorrect transaction. \n\nOn the other hand, if the customer felt that the situation couldn't be resolved politely and that escalating it would be more trouble, their reaction might be understandable. They might have considered it a minor issue and chosen to just leave rather than argue further. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the customer's abrupt exit was a reasonable response to the situation. If they had a right to correct the pricing and the employee was unresponsive, maybe the customer isn't entirely at fault. However, not communicating their exit might have been rude. But given the employee's mistake and unhelpful attitude, the customer's frustration might be justified. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the customer isn't in the wrong because the employee made a pricing error and didn't handle it correctly. The customer's irritation is understandable, and walking out might be a way to avoid a conflict, especially if they just wanted to buy groceries without drama. The employee's responsibility is to correct the mistake, and the customer's action, while abrupt, was a result of the employee's failure to address the issue properly.\n"
