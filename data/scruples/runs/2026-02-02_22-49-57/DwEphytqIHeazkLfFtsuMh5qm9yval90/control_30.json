She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused after a pricing and weight dispute.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author ordered 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli employee gave them 1.745lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The author pointed out the mistake, the employee claimed the price had increased but didn't change the sign. The author got frustrated when the employee didn't acknowledge the weight discrepancy and eventually left without paying the extra amount.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, the author noticed a pricing error and tried to correct it. The employee was inconsistent, first saying the price was up but then not acknowledging the weight. The author's frustration is understandable because they were being overcharged. However, the employee's actions\u2014rebagging and altering the product to make it fit the new price\u2014might have been part of a routine, but the author didn't want to engage further.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have a right to leave without paying? The correct price should be $3.98 for 1lb, but the employee tried to charge $6.98 for 1.745lbs. The author's correct calculation is that the total should be around $6.96 (1.745 * 3.98), but the employee was charging $6.98 for the same weight, which is actually a slight increase but perhaps due to rounding. However, the original issue was the price per pound. The author was supposed to pay $3.98/lb but was charged $6.98/lb. The employee's excuse about the price increase not being updated on the sign is the main problem here. \n\nThe author's reaction: They tried to correct the error, the employee was dismissive and didn't address the weight correctly. The employee started rebagging, but the process was confusing and unsatisfactory. The author walked out, which could be seen as leaving without resolving the issue. However, the author wasn't trying to steal; they recognized a mistake and wanted to pay the correct amount but couldn't get the employee to cooperate. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they left without paying the amount they thought was correct (the original $3.98 for 1lb), then they might be at fault. But if they left because the employee refused to honor the original price, then they might not be. The employee's job is to resolve the discrepancy, not to make the customer feel ignored. The author's frustration is justified if the employee was uncooperative. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the employee confused. The author didn't steal; they left without completing the transaction. However, the employee might have overcharged them. The author's right to leave is debatable. If the author left the items behind, the store would have the product, but they didn't pay the correct amount. So, if the author left the items without paying the correct price, that could be considered theft. But if they left because the employee refused to correct the price, then it's a different scenario. \n\nIn this case, the author said they wanted to pay the correct amount but couldn't get the employee to do so. Leaving without paying the amount they believed was correct (the original $3.98) would be an issue. But the employee was charging $6.98 for 1.745lbs. If the correct price is $3.98/lb, then the correct total would be around $6.96 for 1.745lbs. The employee charged $6.98, which is almost correct, but the author was confused because they were told the price had gone up. However, the original item was supposed to be $3.98/lb. If the price actually increased to $6.98/lb, then the employee might have made a mistake in not updating the sign and in the initial transaction. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. The author's main issue is that the employee didn't address the weight and price discrepancy properly. The employee tried to rebag the product but didn't resolve the pricing issue. The author left because they couldn't get the employee to cooperate. The author might be in the wrong if they left without paying the correct amount, but if the employee was overcharging, then the author is justified in seeking a resolution. However, leaving without paying is problematic. \n\nBut the author didn't take the product; they left it with the employee. So the store would have the product, but the author didn't pay. That could be considered theft. However, the employee's error in pricing might have been the store's fault. The correct action would be to either pay the correct amount or leave the product behind and not take it. The author left the product without paying, which is an issue. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they left the product without paying the correct amount, even if they thought the employee was making a mistake. The proper action would be to either pay the correct amount or leave the product and not take it. By leaving the product without paying, they are in the wrong.\n"
