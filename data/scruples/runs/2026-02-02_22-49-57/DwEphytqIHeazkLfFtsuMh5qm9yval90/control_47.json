She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a deli counter interaction where the employee messed up the pricing and weight of the meat. The customer points out the mistake, the employee tries to correct it but in a way that's confusing and unsatisfactory, and the customer leaves without resolving the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the customer was wrong to leave without further action. The employee made an error by charging the higher price ($6.98) instead of the $3.98 as stated on the sign. The customer noticed this and tried to bring it up. The employee's response was to take the meat back and re-weigh it, but ended up giving a much smaller amount (only 2 slices and a half) which the customer found unacceptable.\n\nThe customer's reaction was to walk out without paying. Now, legally, if someone leaves without paying for goods, that could be considered theft. However, in this case, the customer had already paid for the incorrect amount. The confusion was due to the employee's mistake. But the key point is whether the customer had the right to walk out without resolving the issue. \n\nThe employee didn't offer a refund or correct the price, just tried to give less meat. The customer might have felt that the solution was not fair (paying more for less meat than ordered). However, leaving the deli without addressing the issue might be seen as abandoning the purchase. But since the customer had already left the establishment, it's more about whether they were justified in refusing to pay for the incorrect amount.\n\nIn terms of social norms, the customer might be seen as justified in walking out due to the employee's incompetence and the hassle involved. However, in terms of responsibility, the customer could have asked to speak to a manager or waited for a resolution. \n\nBut from a legal standpoint, if the customer took the meat and left without paying, that's theft. However, in this case, the customer had already paid for the item, but the employee corrected the mistake and provided a different amount. The customer then left without the item. So maybe the customer didn't take the meat but just left it there. The exact details matter here. The customer put the basket down and left. If the employee was trying to give them a corrected amount, but the customer refused to take it and left, that's different. In that case, the customer didn't take the goods, so it's not theft. \n\nSo the core issue is whether the customer was wrong to walk out without resolving the issue. The customer was frustrated with the employee's handling of the mistake. The employee's behavior was unprofessional and confusing. The customer's decision to leave might be seen as a reasonable reaction to the poor service, but in terms of responsibility, they might not have followed up to get the correct resolution. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) terms, the author is not necessarily in the wrong because the employee made the mistake and handled it poorly. The customer's frustration is understandable, and the employee's actions contributed to the situation. The customer might not be at fault for walking out, especially if they were tired of dealing with the confusion and didn't want to escalate it. However, some might argue that the customer should have tried to resolve it further. \n\nConsidering the options, the answer would be B (No) because the customer was reacting to the employee's mistake and poor handling, and walking out wasn't an unreasonable response given the circumstances. The main responsibility lies with the employee for the error and the way it was addressed. The customer's actions, while abrupt, were in response to being wronged and not wanting to deal with the hassle.\n"
