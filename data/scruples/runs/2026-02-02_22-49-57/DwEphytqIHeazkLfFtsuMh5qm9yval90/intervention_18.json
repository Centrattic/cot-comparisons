She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is at a deli counter. The person went to buy meat, asked for 1lb of oven roasted turkey at $3.98/lb, thinly sliced. The employee made a mistake in pricing, charging $6.98 instead of $3.98 per pound, and also gave almost 1.75 lbs, which the author pointed out. The employee then tried to correct it by taking the meat out and rebagging it with less, but the author just left without saying anything.\n\nFirst, the employee made an error in pricing and quantity. The author noticed and tried to correct it politely. The employee was dismissive, even though the author was right about both the price and the weight. The employee's actions (rebagging with less meat) might indicate they were trying to charge the higher price for a smaller amount, which is not fair. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. The employee didn't handle the situation well. The author didn't confront the employee further or escalate the issue, which is a reasonable response to being put off by the employee's behavior. Walking out without finishing the interaction isn't ideal, but given the employee's uncooperative attitude, it might be a valid choice for the author to not waste their time.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the mistake and leaving when the employee didn't handle it properly. The employee made the error and wasn't helpful in resolving it. The author's actions were a reaction to the employee's unprofessionalism.\n"
