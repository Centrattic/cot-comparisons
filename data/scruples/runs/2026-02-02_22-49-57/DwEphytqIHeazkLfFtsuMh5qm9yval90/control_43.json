She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused. The situation is about a pricing mistake. The author ordered turkey meat at $3.98 per pound but was charged $6.98, and the weight was 1.745 pounds instead of 1 pound.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of both parties. The author asked for 1 pound, and the employee gave them 1.745 pounds. The employee initially said the price was higher because of an error in the sign. Then, when the author pointed out the weight issue, the employee tried to recut the meat to reduce the weight. \n\nThe author got frustrated and left without saying anything. The key points here are whether the author handled the situation appropriately. The employee made a mistake in price and weight. The author tried to point out the weight issue, but the employee didn't address it correctly by just removing a few slices. The author's reaction was to leave without paying, which could be seen as stealing if they didn't settle the payment. \n\nBut wait, the author did not take the second bag that the employee tried to give them. They left after putting down the basket. However, did they pay for the first bag? The initial bag was overcharged. The employee tried to correct it by recutting, but the author walked out. If the author didn't pay for the corrected amount or the original mistake, that could be an issue. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the employee confused. The author's frustration is understandable given the confusion and incorrect pricing. However, leaving without resolving the payment might be problematic. If the author left the store without paying for the correct amount, that's theft. But if they didn't take the second bag and left the basket, maybe the employee still had the item. \n\nThe employee's mistake was significant: overcharging and incorrect weight. The author tried to address it but got frustrated. The employee's handling was poor, but the author's response was to leave. In terms of responsibility, the store made a mistake, and the author is a customer trying to get the correct service. However, walking out without settling the payment could be considered in the author's wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if the author didn't take the product and left, maybe they intended to not buy it and not pay. But the store had already given them a product. So if they didn't pay anything, that's theft. But the user's story doesn't mention them taking the bag. The employee was trying to correct it, but the author left the basket. So maybe the author didn't take the product, so they aren't stealing. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, the author could have asked to speak to a manager. But they chose to leave because they didn't want to be \"that guy.\" The employee's behavior was unprofessional, and the author's frustration is valid. However, the act of leaving without resolving the issue might be seen as not taking responsibility. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The store made a pricing error, and the employee mishandled it. The author tried to point it out but got frustrated. Leaving without paying for the product would be wrong. However, if the author didn't take the product and left the basket, maybe they didn't take anything. \n\nThe key here is whether the author intended to pay. They didn't take the corrected product, but the original product was given by the store. If they didn't pay for the original, that's theft. But the story says they were handed the incorrect product and then the employee tried to correct it. The author left the basket, so maybe they didn't take the first bag either. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. If the author didn't take any product and left, then they might not be at fault. But if they took the first bag and then left without paying for it, that's wrong. The story says they were handed the incorrect product, then the employee tried to correct it. The author put the basket down and left, implying they didn't take the product. \n\nIn that case, the author might not be in the wrong for leaving, as they were trying to get the correct service. The employee's mistake was significant, and the author's frustration is understandable. However, the author could have asked for a manager instead of leaving. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because the store made the mistake, and the employee handled it poorly. The author's reaction, while abrupt, was due to the employee's errors, and they didn't take the product without paying. However, the line between frustration and responsibility is thin here.\n"
