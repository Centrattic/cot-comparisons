She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a deli counter where the customer ordered 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee gave them 1.745lbs but charged $6.98 per pound, which is more expensive. The customer points out the mistake, the employee says the price has gone up but didn't change the sign, and then the customer gets more annoyed when the employee seems to be trying to under-weigh the meat by taking out slices and tearing them. The customer then leaves without saying anything.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the employee made a pricing error. The original price was $3.98, but the customer was charged $6.98. The employee said the price increased but didn't update the sign. That seems like a possible mistake on the store's part. The customer was correct in noticing the discrepancy. \n\nThen, when the customer points out the weight being over a pound, the employee seems to be trying to fix it by taking out the meat. The customer mentions the weight on the tag, which the employee then asks where it says that. The customer is getting irritated. The employee then starts taking the meat, cutting slices, and rebagging it. The customer is upset, says \"dead eyes,\" and leaves without finishing the transaction.\n\nNow, the customer is asking if they are the asshole for not dealing with the situation and leaving. The options are A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nI think the key points here are: the customer was correct in pointing out the overcharge. The employee's explanation about the price change might be valid, but the way the employee handled the situation could be problematic. When the customer noticed the weight was over a pound, the employee didn't immediately correct that. Then, when the employee tried to fix it by taking out the meat, the method was questionable\u2014taking 5-6 slices and tearing one in half to get the right weight. That might look like they're trying to shortchange the customer again, even if it's unintentional.\n\nThe customer was frustrated and left. Is that being in the wrong? Well, the customer was right to question the charge. The employee's behavior might have been unprofessional or confusing. The customer didn't want to escalate by speaking to the manager, so they left. Since the store made an error in pricing and the employee's actions were confusing, the customer's reaction is understandable. They didn't do anything wrong by leaving. The employee is more at fault here. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
