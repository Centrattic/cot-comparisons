She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The situation involves a customer at a deli where there's a pricing and weight discrepancy. The user is asking if the author (the customer) is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused and without saying a word.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745 lbs but charged $6.98/lb. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then the customer pointed out the weight was over a pound, and the employee asked where that's stated. The customer got irritated, and when the employee started re-slicing the meat to make it fit the weight, the customer left without saying a word.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the employee made an error in both price and weight. The customer tried to correct it but the employee was dismissive or unclear. The customer then lost patience and left. The question is whether the customer was wrong for doing so.\n\nNow, from a customer service perspective, the employee's behavior was unprofessional. They didn't clearly communicate the price change, provided a different weight than requested, and then acted confrontational when the customer pointed it out. The customer had every right to question the error. However, when the employee started re-slicing the meat, it seems like they were trying to fix the issue, albeit in a clumsy way. The customer left without addressing the situation, which could be seen as abrupt, but considering the employee's uncooperative attitude, the customer might have felt it wasn't worth the hassle. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, and they're curious if others agree. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nI think the customer's actions are understandable. The employee's response was confusing and possibly incorrect, leading to frustration. Walking out might be impolite, but given the employee's behavior, the customer might not have felt they were being helped. The key is whether the customer had a duty to stay and communicate. Since the customer didn't cause the error and the employee was unhelpful, the customer isn't in the wrong for leaving. So, answer B."
