She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario involves a deli counter interaction where the customer ended up leaving without resolving the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745lbs, but charged at $6.98/lb, which is more expensive. The customer pointed out the discrepancy, the employee initially denied it, then tried to fix it by taking out the meat and rebagging it. The customer then left without finishing the interaction.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The customer noticed the price discrepancy and tried to address it politely. The employee made a mistake in pricing and then seemed to be defensive. The customer, after repeated issues, lost patience and left. \n\nThe question is whether the customer is in the wrong. From the description, the customer was trying to correct an error. The employee might have been incorrect in applying the price, leading to overcharging. The customer's frustration is understandable, especially if they found the employee's handling of the situation unprofessional. Leaving without resolving it could be seen as abrupt, but the alternative of escalating to a manager might have been more effective. However, the customer's main issue was being overcharged, and they did point that out. The employee's actions (changing the weight and price) were part of the problem. \n\nSo, the customer's actions of leaving might be seen as a reaction to the employee's incorrect handling. They might not be in the wrong because they were trying to correct a mistake and couldn't handle the situation any longer. The employee's behavior (denial, incorrect weighing) contributed to the problem. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
