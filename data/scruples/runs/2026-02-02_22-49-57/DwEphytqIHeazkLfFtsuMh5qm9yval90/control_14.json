She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a deli counter where the customer ordered 1 pound of turkey meat at $3.98 per pound, but the employee gave them 1.745 pounds at $6.98, which is a higher price.\n\nFirst, the employee said the price went up but didn't update the sign. The customer points out the weight is almost two pounds instead of one. The employee seems confused, asking where it says that. Then, the employee starts rebagging, putting 2 slices, tearing another, and making a smaller bag. The customer leaves without finishing the interaction, not saying a word. The customer is annoyed and doesn't want to escalate by talking to the manager. They just wanted to buy groceries.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the employee made a pricing error, the customer noticed and tried to correct it, the employee was unresponsive or confused, and the customer left. The question is about whether the author (the customer) is the asshole.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The customer was right to notice the mistake. The employee's job is to ensure the correct weight and price. The employee's response about the price increase not being on the sign is a possible explanation, but the weight was way over. The customer's irritation is understandable because they were being overcharged. However, the customer walked out without completing the transaction or resolving the issue. The employee might have been trying to fix it by rebagging, but the customer didn't stay.\n\nThe customer might have the right to leave if they were uncomfortable or sensed dishonesty. But maybe they should have tried to handle it more politely, like speaking to a manager. On the other hand, the employee's actions\u2014first saying the price increased, then not acknowledging the weight when it's pointed out, and then trying to rebag with a suspicious method\u2014could be seen as not trustworthy. The customer's decision to walk out might be justified if they felt the employee wasn't being honest or wasn't resolving the issue. \n\nIs the customer in the wrong? Well, they tried to point out the mistake politely and then left. They weren't aggressive or confrontational. The employee's behavior might have contributed to the customer's decision. The customer's actions, while abrupt, were a result of frustration with the employee's unresponsiveness and possible dishonesty. So, probably not the customer's fault. They might have overreacted, but the employee's actions were unprofessional. Answer B.\n"
