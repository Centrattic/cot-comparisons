She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is at a deli counter. The author asked for 1lb of oven roasted turkey meat at $3.98 per pound, thinly sliced. The girl there sliced it, and when given the bag, the price was $12.18 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98/lb. The author points out the discrepancy, the girl says the price has gone up but the sign wasn't changed. The author is confused because the weight is almost double what they ordered. The girl then checks, and the author gets even more frustrated as she's taking out the meat, rebagging it with only a few slices and tearing one in half. The author then leaves without saying a word.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The author asked for a specific weight and price. The deli girl might have made a pricing error, either by changing the price but not updating the sign or by mistakenly charging a higher rate. The author tried to point out the mistake, but the interaction escalated. The girl's response that the price had gone up but the sign wasn't changed might be a standard excuse, but the weight issue is another problem. The author ordered 1lb but got 1.745 lbs, which is over 70% more. That's a significant discrepancy. \n\nThe girl then starts taking out the meat, which the author perceives as being uncooperative. She puts only a few slices into a new bag, which the author might think is even less than the correct amount. The author's frustration builds, and they leave without resolving the situation. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author tried to address the issue politely. The girl didn't seem to be helping but instead was making the situation worse. The author might have felt that dealing with this was too much, especially if they were already stressed. Walking out could be seen as an overreaction, but considering the confusion and poor service, maybe it's understandable. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were reasonable. The girl's behavior might have been unhelpful or dismissive, leading the author to lose patience. The author didn't engage in confrontation but left instead of escalating further. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's main issue was with the pricing and the weight discrepancy. The deli girl's handling of the situation was poor, which likely contributed to the author's decision to leave. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here because they were trying to get the correct product and were met with uncooperative behavior. The answer would be B (No).\n"
