She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving a confused deli girl holding the meat without saying a word. The situation involves a pricing discrepancy and some frustration from the customer.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1 pound of turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli employee gave them 1.745 pounds priced at $6.98/lb. The customer points out the mistake, and the employee claims the price has increased but hasn't updated the sign. Then, the employee asks if it's okay if it's a bit over the pound, which the customer agrees to. However, the customer is confused because the weight is almost double what they requested. The employee then rebags it, using only a few slices and tearing one to meet the 1-pound weight. The customer gets fed up and leaves without resolving the issue.\n\nNow, considering the customer's actions, they did try to point out the mistake politely. The employee's response seems incorrect because the price per pound was higher than the sign indicated. The customer's frustration is understandable, especially when the employee starts rebagging in a way that seems haphazard (tearing slices, etc.), which could be seen as dismissive or incorrect. The customer's decision to leave might be due to the stress and time they don't want to spend, especially if they just want to buy groceries. \n\nHowever, the customer didn't follow up by talking to a manager or resolving the issue. They left the employee in a confusing situation. While the employee might have made a mistake, the customer could have handled it more constructively. Walking out might be seen as abrupt, but given the situation's stress and the employee's apparent confusion, maybe the customer's reaction is understandable. \n\nSo, the key points: Did the customer have a valid reason to leave? Yes, as they were being overcharged and the employee's actions were confusing. But did they handle it appropriately? Possibly not. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Considering the employee's error and the customer's attempt to address it, the customer might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B, No.\n"
