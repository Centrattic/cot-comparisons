She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli employee who messed up the pricing and weight of the meat the author purchased.\n\nFirst, the author went to the deli and asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee said it might be a bit over, which the author agreed to. But when the author checked, the weight was 1.745lbs and the price was $6.98 per pound, making it $12.18. The author pointed this out politely, and the employee claimed the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then, the author mentioned the weight discrepancy again, the employee took it back, removed some meat, weighed it again, and tried to give it back. The author then left without saying a word, feeling irritated but not wanting to escalate to talking to a manager.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the employee made a mistake in both price and weight. The author tried to address it politely, the employee corrected the weight but not the price (since the sign was wrong). The author got frustrated and left. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the employee's initial error was in the price and the weight. The author was correct in pointing out the weight was over a pound, and the employee adjusted that. However, the price was still wrong because the sign wasn't updated. The author might have felt double-charged, but the employee corrected the weight. The author's reaction was to leave without a word, which could be seen as rude, but given the confusion and frustration, maybe it's understandable. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is the asshole. The employee's behavior was unprofessional, not correcting the price even after the weight was fixed. The author tried to correct it but lost patience. However, by walking out without paying, the author could be accused of stealing if they didn't return the item or clarify the charge. But the employee was in the process of recalculating the weight and price, so maybe the author was just done with the interaction and left, assuming the issue would be resolved. \n\nWait, the employee took the meat back, rebagged it, and tried to give it back. The author didn't complete the transaction, so maybe they didn't pay the adjusted price. If the author left without paying, that's theft. But the employee might have intended to adjust the charge. The author's silence might have been an attempt to avoid confrontation, but if they took the product without paying, that's wrong. However, the original price was $3.98, and the employee tried to charge $6.98 per pound for the original request. The author's confusion is valid. \n\nSo, the employee's mistake was in both price and weight. The author pointed out the weight issue, the employee corrected the weight but not the price. The author got fed up and left. The employee's job is to handle these discrepancies, but maybe the author isn't at fault for being frustrated and not wanting to argue further. Alternatively, the author should have either paid the correct price for the adjusted weight or insisted on the correct price. \n\nIf the author left the deli without paying for the meat (even if it was corrected in weight), that's not okay. But if they left the meat behind (as implied by putting the basket down and walking out), then maybe they didn't take it. However, the description says \"I looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\" So they abandoned the basket with the meat? That could mean they didn't take the meat, so they wouldn't be charged. But the employee was trying to rebag it, so maybe the author left the basket there, implying they didn't take the meat, thus not paying. In that case, the author is in the wrong because they left the item and didn't complete the transaction. \n\nBut the original problem was the employee overcharging. The author was correct in pointing out the weight was over a pound, which the employee acknowledged. The employee then adjusted the weight by removing some slices, which would mean the final weight is less than 1lb. The author might have thought they were overcharged for the weight and the price. However, the author left before finalizing the purchase. So, the author didn't take the meat, hence no theft, but the employee was still wrong. But the question is about the author's actions. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but the way they handled it\u2014abandoning the basket and walking out\u2014could be seen as rude. However, if they didn't take the meat, maybe they just left it there. But the employee was in the process of recalculating. The author might have been in the right to leave because the employee was being uncooperative. Alternatively, the author should have either waited for the correct price or walked away without the meat. \n\nHmm. So, the author tried to be polite, the employee made mistakes, and the author left in frustration. The author didn't explicitly state they left without paying, but the context implies they didn't take the meat. So maybe the author is not in the wrong because they didn't pay for something that was overpriced and over-measured. However, the act of leaving the employee with a pile of meat and not saying a word could be seen as not taking responsibility. \n\nIn some cases, if you leave an item behind, the store might charge you. But the author's basket was with the meat. So the employee would have to notice the basket was abandoned. But the author's intention was to not complete the purchase, so they left. That's their right, but the way they did it\u2014without a word\u2014might be considered inconsiderate. \n\nSo the answer depends on whether the author actually paid or not. If they left the meat and didn't pay, they might be in the wrong. But if they just left without taking the meat (assuming the employee was handling it), then maybe not. The description is a bit unclear. The author says they put the basket down and walked out. If they left the basket there, maybe the employee would have to handle it. But the author's silence could be seen as not being responsible. \n\nAlternatively, the author's frustration is justified, and their actions were a result of the employee's incompetence. So the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the employee was at fault for the incorrect price and weight. The author tried to correct it, but the employee was uncooperative. The author's frustration is valid, and leaving without a word is understandable in that context. They didn't take the meat, so no theft. The employee is in the wrong for not handling the mistake properly. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole.\n"
