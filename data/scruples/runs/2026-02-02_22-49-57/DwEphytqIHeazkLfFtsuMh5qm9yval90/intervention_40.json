She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who left the deli girl confused and holding meat without saying a word is in the wrong. The scenario is that the customer asked for a pound of turkey meat at $3.98 per pound, but the deli girl gave them a much pricier 1.745 lbs at $6.98, and then when the customer pointed it out, the girl took the meat back and tried to weigh it improperly by just putting a few slices on the scale. The customer then left without finishing the interaction.\n\nHmm, first, the customer's actions. They noticed the price discrepancy and tried to address it politely. The deli girl's response was that the price had gone up, but the sign wasn't updated. Then the customer tried to point out the weight issue, and the girl started re-weighing by taking slices and tearing them, which seems incorrect. The customer got frustrated and left, not wanting to escalate to the manager.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the customer had a valid reason to question the price and weight. The deli girl's actions were confusing and possibly incorrect in how she handled the weight discrepancy. The customer's reaction was to leave, which might be seen as abrupt, but perhaps justified given the situation.\n\nIs the customer in the wrong? Well, they did attempt to correct the mistake and were polite initially. The deli girl didn't acknowledge the weight issue properly, just focusing on the price. The customer's irritation is understandable, especially when the girl was taking out the meat and trying to repackage it in a way that might not be accurate. Walking out might be a bit harsh, but if the customer felt that the employee wasn't addressing the issue correctly and didn't want to argue further, maybe it's not their fault.\n\nOn the other hand, not speaking to the manager could be seen as not following up. However, the customer mentions they didn't want to be the \"Can I speak to your manager?\" guy, which is a common trope. They might have felt it wasn't worth the hassle. The confusion from the deli girl might also be due to a mistake on her part, either in pricing or in handling the customer's request.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the customer isn't in the wrong. They tried to resolve the issue but gave up when the employee was unhelpful or incorrect. The deli girl's actions contributed to the situation, and the customer's decision to leave, while abrupt, was a response to being frustrated and not wanting to deal with it further.\n"
