She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a deli counter incident. The user went to get some turkey meat. They asked for 1lb of oven roasted turkey at $3.98 per pound. The deli girl gave them a package that weighed 1.745 pounds and charged $6.98 per pound, totaling $12.18. The user pointed out the discrepancy, and there was some back and forth where the deli girl tried to adjust the weight by taking out slices and rebagging it. The user then left without saying a word.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The user asked for a specific product at a certain price. The deli employee either made a pricing mistake or misread the sign. When the user noticed the error, they politely pointed it out. The employee then tried to correct the weight by removing slices but didn't address the pricing discrepancy. The user felt frustrated and walked out.\n\nNow, considering the user's actions: they did mention the issue politely initially. When the employee tried to rebag, the user didn't engage further and left. The user didn't escalate to a manager, which some might say is avoiding conflict, but others might see it as a reasonable response to poor service.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, they didn't confront the employee aggressively. They tried to resolve the issue but when the employee didn't fix the pricing error and instead focused on the weight, the user left. The user's frustration is understandable because they were overcharged. However, leaving without completing the transaction might leave the employee confused, but it's not necessarily wrong. The user's main issue was being overcharged, and they didn't resort to confrontation. So, the answer is B, No, the user isn't in the wrong here.\n"
