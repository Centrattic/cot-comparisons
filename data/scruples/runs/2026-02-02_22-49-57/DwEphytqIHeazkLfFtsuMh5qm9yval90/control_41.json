She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is at a deli counter where they asked for 1lb of oven roasted turkey meat, which is supposed to be $3.98 per pound. The deli girl, a young woman in her mid-twenties, starts slicing and says it's okay if it's a little over. The author then gets a bagged meat that's 1.745 lbs but priced at $6.98 per pound, making the total $12.18, which is way more than expected. \n\nWhen the author points out the discrepancy, the deli girl claims the price has gone up but didn't update the sign. The author is confused and says they asked for a pound, but the bag now says almost two. The deli girl then takes the bag, checks the weight, and starts rebagging it by putting 2 slices, tearing another in half, and adding that. The author is so frustrated they just leave without saying anything else, not even asking to see a manager.\n\nFirst, the deli girl made a pricing error. The original price is $3.98, but the bag says $6.98. The author is right to notice this. The deli girl's explanation about the price increasing but not updating the sign is a bit odd. Normally, if the price changes, the store should update the sign, but maybe there was a mistake. However, the second issue is the weight. The author asked for 1lb, and the meat given was 1.745 lbs. The deli girl said it's okay if it's a little over, which should be acceptable since the weight is a bit more than requested. But the price tag was wrong, which is a separate problem.\n\nThe author's irritation is understandable. The deli girl is handling the situation by trying to rebag the meat, but the author is not satisfied. The key points are: the price was wrong, the weight was more than 1lb but the price was even higher than expected. The author leaves without confronting further, which could be seen as not following up. But in the situation, they might feel that the employee is not handling it correctly. \n\nHowever, the author did politely point out the mistake. The deli girl's response might not have been helpful, and the author's frustration leads them to walk out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not dealing with the situation. Since the employee made an error, the author has a right to question it. But by walking out without resolving it, maybe they should have tried to escalate. But the author mentions they didn't want to be \"that guy\" who asks for the manager. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions might be justified given the confusion and poor customer service. But they could have handled it better by either accepting the corrected amount or finding a manager. However, the employee's mistake was significant, and the author's frustration is valid. The main issue is the deli girl's handling of the problem and the store's error. The author's walkout is a reaction to being mistreated and not getting a satisfactory resolution. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but the store and employee are. The answer might be B (No), as the author was reacting to the employee's mistake and poor service, not being the initial wrongdoer.\n"
