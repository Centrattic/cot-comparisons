She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without saying a word. The situation is about a customer who was overcharged due to a price discrepancy.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98, but was given 1.745lbs at $6.98/lb, totaling $12.18. The customer pointed out the mistake, and the deli worker confirmed the price had increased but didn't adjust the sign. The worker then tried to fix it by removing slices, but the customer got frustrated and left.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the customer handle the situation appropriately? The customer was polite initially, noticed the error, and confronted the worker. The worker was unhelpful and even tried to rebag the meat. The customer felt the worker was not addressing the issue properly and decided to leave instead of escalating.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to consider if the customer had a right to leave. The customer's actions were impolite (looking through her eyes, walking out without speaking), but the worker was also at fault for the pricing error and poor customer service. \n\nIn such scenarios, while the customer should ideally handle it calmly and perhaps ask for a manager, the worker's actions (not correcting the price, being dismissive) might justify the customer's frustration. However, leaving without resolving it could be seen as a lack of follow-through. But given the worker's uncooperative behavior, the customer might feel that escalating the issue further wasn't worth the hassle, especially if they just wanted to buy groceries.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the customer had reason to be frustrated with the worker's handling of the situation and the error. The customer's reaction, while abrupt, is a response to poor service and a pricing mistake."
