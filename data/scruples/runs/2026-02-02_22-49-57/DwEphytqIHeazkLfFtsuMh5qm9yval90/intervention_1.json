She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused after a pricing error. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The author noticed the discrepancy and pointed it out. The employee initially denied the mistake, citing a price change but not the sign. Then she tried to fix it by taking out the meat, but only put 2 slices and part of another, leading to a smaller weight. The author then left without saying a word.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the employee made a pricing error, possibly due to an outdated sign. The author tried to correct it, the employee was dismissive, and the author lost patience and left. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were trying to be polite, checked the weight and price, and when the employee didn't correct it properly, they walked out. Their frustration is understandable because they were overcharged and the employee didn't resolve it effectively. However, leaving without resolving the issue or involving a manager might be seen as avoiding conflict. But considering the employee's unhelpful response, maybe the author had enough and didn't want to escalate it with a manager. \n\nOn the other hand, the employee might have made a mistake, but the author could have at least tried to speak to the manager instead of just leaving. However, the customer might feel that the employee wasn't cooperative, so walking out is a way to avoid further hassle. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here because they were trying to address the issue, the employee wasn't helpful, and the author's frustration is justified. They didn't act aggressively, just walked out. So the answer should be B.\n"
