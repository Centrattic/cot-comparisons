She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter where the customer got overcharged. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745lbs but charged $6.98/lb, which is way over the initial price. The customer pointed this out, and the employee said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. The customer was then told about the weight being over a pound, and the employee tried to fix it by taking out meat and weighing slices. The author left without saying anything, feeling irritated.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author act wrong by leaving without addressing the issue further?\n\nFirst, the employee made a mistake in pricing and weight. The customer tried to correct it, but the employee was dismissive or not clear. The customer got frustrated and left. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did confront the employee politely first. The employee's responses might have been confusing or incorrect. The customer didn't escalate to a manager, which they could have done. However, the situation might have been stressful, and the customer might have felt that dealing with it further was not worth their time. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's action of leaving without paying was a breach, but the context is there was a pricing error. However, the customer still owed the correct amount. By leaving, they didn't pay anything, which could be seen as theft if they took the product without paying. But the employee was the one who made the mistake. \n\nSo, maybe the author should have either paid the correct price they were quoted initially or asked to speak to a manager to resolve the discrepancy. Since they left the deli employee holding the bag (literally), that's where the problem is. The customer didn't follow up properly. Even if the employee was wrong, the customer still needed to address it correctly. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't properly resolve the issue. They should have either paid the correct amount or sought assistance from a manager. Leaving without paying is not acceptable, even if the employee made a mistake.\n"
