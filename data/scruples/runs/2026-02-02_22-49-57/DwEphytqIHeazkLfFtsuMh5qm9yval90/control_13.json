She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a deli girl who overcharged the author for turkey meat.\n\nFirst, the author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98, and the girl said it might be a bit over. The author agreed. But when the author checked the price tag, it was $12.18 for 1.745lbs at $6.98. The author pointed out the mistake, the employee said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then the author got more irritated when the employee took out the meat, which was very thick, and tried to rebag it by adding only a few slices and even tearing one. The author left without saying a word.\n\nSo, the key points here: the employee made a pricing error, didn't inform the customer about the new price, and then tried to correct the weight by removing slices. The author felt the employee was not being honest and lost patience.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were charged more than expected. The employee first said the price was higher but didn't mention the weight was over a pound. Then, when the author challenged the weight, the employee tried to adjust by cutting the meat, which seems counterintuitive because the meat was thick. The author might think the employee is trying to make up the weight without transparency.\n\nThe employee's actions: They didn't correct the weight when the price was changed. The author pointed out both the price and weight discrepancy. The employee then tried to rebag, but instead of adding more slices to reach 1lb (if the price is now higher per pound), they took out slices, which makes the weight less. That\u2019s confusing because if the price increased, the amount should stay the same unless the customer wants less. But the customer initially wanted 1lb, and the employee said it would be a bit over. Now the price per pound is higher, so the total cost should be more if the weight is the same. However, the employee tried to reduce the weight to lower the cost, but the customer probably expected to pay the correct price for the 1lb they ordered, not an overage. \n\nThe author's reaction: They were polite when pointing out the mistake but then lost patience. The employee's behavior was uncooperative and confusing, leading the author to leave. The author didn't escalate to a manager, which some might argue is part of the problem because the manager could have resolved it. However, the employee's actions suggest they might not be trustworthy. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong: The employee made a mistake in pricing and didn't handle the situation well. The author has a right to question the discrepancy and might have been in a stressful situation. Walking out could be seen as abrupt, but if the employee was not being helpful and the author was fed up, it might be understandable. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were trying to get a fair charge and the employee wasn't clarifying the situation properly. The key is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the employee's response. Since the employee tried to correct the weight by reducing it, which might not be the right approach, the author's frustration is valid. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
