She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl without saying a word. The situation is about a pricing and weight discrepancy.\n\nFirst, the user bought meat, was given a weight and price that didn't match what was on the sign. The employee said the price had increased but didn't update the sign. The user pointed out the weight was over a pound, but the employee didn't seem to acknowledge that. The user got frustrated and left without finishing the interaction.\n\nI need to determine if the user was wrong here. The key points are: Did the user act unreasonably? The employee made a mistake in pricing and weight. The user tried to correct it politely, then became irritated when the employee didn't address the weight issue. The employee then tried to fix the weight by removing slices, but the user was still upset and left.\n\nIs walking out without resolving the issue wrong? Well, the user was a customer trying to get the correct product. The employee's behavior was unprofessional\u2014arguing with a customer, not properly fixing the weight. The user's frustration is understandable. While ideally, one might speak to a manager, the user felt they couldn't handle the situation. Leaving in that context might be seen as the user's way to avoid further conflict, especially if the employee was unhelpful. So, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
