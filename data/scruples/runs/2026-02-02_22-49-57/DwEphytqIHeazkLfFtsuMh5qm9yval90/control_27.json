She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a deli employee who made a pricing mistake, and the author's reaction to it.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee made a mistake, charged $6.98/lb for 1.745lbs. The customer pointed out the error. The employee corrected it by cutting the meat into slices, but the customer was frustrated and left without a word.\n\nThe key points here are the customer's actions and intentions. The customer was polite initially, pointed out the mistake, and the employee tried to correct it. However, the customer felt disrespected by the employee's approach (tearing slices) and left without completing the purchase. The customer didn't confront the manager or cause a scene, just walked out.\n\nThe employee's mistake was in pricing and possibly miscommunication. The customer's frustration is understandable given the price discrepancy and the employee's method of correction. The customer's decision to leave might be seen as a personal choice, especially after trying to resolve it politely. There's no indication of harassment or intentional harm. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for leaving after a frustrating encounter. The employee's error and handling contributed to the situation. The customer's actions were a response to the service they received. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
