She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee made a mistake, charged them almost double, and then when confronted, the employee was dismissive and tried to fix the weight by cutting meat slices. The author got frustrated and left without saying anything.\n\nFirst, the employee made a pricing error. The customer pointed it out politely. The employee initially denied the mistake, then tried to adjust the weight. The problem is that the customer was right to notice the mistake, and the employee's response was unhelpful. The customer was being patient but eventually lost their temper. However, walking out without resolving the issue might be seen as a problem. But considering the employee's behavior, the customer might feel justified. The key is whether the customer's reaction was reasonable given the employee's actions. Since the customer tried to communicate and the employee was uncooperative, the customer isn't entirely at fault. So the answer is B.\n"
