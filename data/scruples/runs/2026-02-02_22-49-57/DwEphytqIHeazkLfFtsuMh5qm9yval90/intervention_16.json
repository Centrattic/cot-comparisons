She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without saying a word.\n\nSo the situation is the author goes to the deli, asks for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gives them 1.745 lbs but charges $6.98/lb. The author points out the mistake, the employee says the price increased but didn't update the sign. Then the author is told they asked if it's okay if it's a little over. The employee then takes the meat, removes most of it, and gives back a smaller amount. The author gets frustrated and walks out without saying anything else.\n\nFirst, the employee made a pricing error. The author is correct in pointing out the discrepancy. The employee's response that the price has gone up but the sign wasn't updated\u2014that's on the store's end, not the customer's. The customer was told the price was $3.98, so they were reasonable in expecting that price.\n\nThen the employee takes the meat back and starts cutting it down. The author is confused because the weight was almost double what they asked for. The employee's actions might have been trying to fix the problem, but the way they did it (tearing slices, etc.) might have been unprofessional or confusing. \n\nThe author's reaction: they put the basket down and left. They didn't yell, didn't argue, just walked out. They mention being \"audibly irritated\" but then losing patience. The key is whether their response was appropriate. \n\nIn retail, it's common for employees to make mistakes. The author tried to address it politely. The employee's explanation about the price change might be true, but the original price the customer was quoted was $3.98. If the new price is $6.98, the employee should have informed the customer upfront. \n\nThe author might have been in a hurry, frustrated by the employee's response, and the way the employee tried to fix it (taking out most of the meat) could have made the customer feel like they were being shortchanged or treated disrespectfully. \n\nThe author's decision to walk out could be seen as impolite, but considering the confusion and the employee's actions, maybe it's understandable. The question is whether the author was wrong. The employee was at fault for the pricing error and the way they handled the correction. The author's frustration is reasonable, and walking out might not be the best approach, but it's not necessarily them being in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the employee made the mistake and handled the resolution poorly, leading to the customer's frustration. The customer's actions, while abrupt, were a response to a confusing and possibly rude interaction.\n"
