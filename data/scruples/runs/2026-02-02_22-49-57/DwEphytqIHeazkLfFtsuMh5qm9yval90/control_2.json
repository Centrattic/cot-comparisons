She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without speaking to a manager. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author asked for 1lb of oven roasted turkey at $3.98/lb, thinly sliced. The deli employee gave them 1.745lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The author noticed the discrepancy, pointed it out, and the employee first said the price was increased but the sign wasn't changed. Then the author noted the weight was almost double, and the employee became dismissive, leading the author to leave without resolving it.\n\nSo, the key points here are the pricing and the weight. The employee might have made a mistake in charging the wrong price or giving more than the requested weight. The author tried to handle it politely but got frustrated. The employee's response about the price sign changing but the sign not being updated could be a valid point, but the weight issue is separate. The author was charged for 1.745lbs, which is more than the 1lb they asked for. The employee offered to rebag it, but when the author pointed out the weight, she didn't seem to address it properly. \n\nNow, the author's actions: They left the deli girl holding the meat and walked out. They didn't confront the manager, which is a common way to resolve such issues. The question is whether the author is right to do that or if they should have been more patient.\n\nFrom a customer service perspective, the employee might have been in error. The author's frustration is understandable given the situation. However, walking out without clarifying the issue could be seen as not taking the proper steps to resolve it. The AITA community often values taking the appropriate channels, like speaking to a manager, especially when there's a clear financial discrepancy. \n\nBut the employee's behavior was problematic too. She was dismissive and didn't immediately correct the issue. The author might have felt that escalating it further wouldn't help, given the employee's response. However, the author's choice to leave without addressing it could be seen as not giving the store a chance to correct the mistake, which might be expected in a typical situation. \n\nSo, the author's decision to walk out might be justified due to the employee's uncooperative attitude, but technically, they might have been in the wrong for not following up with a manager. The employee's error could be a valid reason for the price difference, but the weight was over 1.7lbs, which is a significant amount. The author's irritation is clear, but the best course of action would be to inform a manager. However, the author didn't do that. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, even if the other party is at fault, the person who didn't take the proper steps (like speaking to a manager) might still be considered the asshole. But the employee's behavior in not acknowledging the weight issue after the author pointed it out is also a problem. The author could have argued that the weight was more than they asked for, even if the price had increased. Maybe the employee was charging the higher price but still overcharged by giving more weight than requested. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the higher price was for a different product. The author was supposed to get 1lb at $3.98, but the employee gave them 1.745lbs at $6.98. If the higher price is for a premium product, then the weight might be part of that. But the author's request was specific to the product they wanted. \n\nIn the end, the author's main issue was the unexpected higher cost and weight. They approached the employee, who was unhelpful. The author's decision to leave might be seen as standing up for themselves, but they could have escalated. However, given the employee's response, maybe the author felt it was a lost cause. \n\nThe answer likely depends on whether the author has a duty to follow through. If they just walked out without trying to resolve it, maybe they're in the wrong. But the employee's actions were also incorrect. The AITA community often looks at both sides. The author tried to be polite but was met with defensiveness. Walking out might be a reaction to the employee's behavior, so maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: The employee made a mistake and was dismissive. The author tried to address it but lost patience. The author might not be in the wrong because the employee didn't handle it properly. But if the store's policy requires a manager to handle such issues, the author didn't follow up. However, considering the employee's actions, the author might not be the asshole here.\n"
