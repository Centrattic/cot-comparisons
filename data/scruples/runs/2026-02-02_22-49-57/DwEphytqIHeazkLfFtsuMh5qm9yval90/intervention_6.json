She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking if the author (AITA) was wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without saying a word. The scenario is that the author asked for 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98/lb, but the deli employee gave them 1.745lbs at the higher price of $6.98. The author points out the mistake, the employee says the price was changed but didn't update the sign. The author is annoyed because the weight was way over what they ordered, even though the employee had asked if it being a little over was okay. Then, when the author confronts her, the employee starts rebagging by putting 2 slices, tearing another in half, and putting that on the scale. The author just leaves without resolving it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had a right to be upset. The price on the sign was $3.98, and the employee gave more than the ordered weight. The employee admitted the price had increased but didn't update the sign, so they charged the higher rate. The author probably thought they were being overcharged for both the price and the weight. The employee then tried to correct it by removing meat, but maybe that wasn't the right approach. The author's response was to leave without saying anything else.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the employee made a mistake in the weight and the price. The author pointed out the mistake, but when the employee tried to adjust, maybe the author felt it wasn't enough or was frustrated with the process. However, walking out without resolving the issue might have been rude or left the employee in a tough spot. But the employee had already started rebagging, so maybe the author just didn't want to deal with it anymore. The key is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the situation. The author was polite initially, tried to correct the mistake, but when the employee tried to fix it, perhaps the author lost patience. Since the employee was in the middle of correcting it, the author might be in the wrong for leaving without completing the transaction or providing feedback. Alternatively, the author might have felt the employee was dismissive, so leaving was a valid reaction to the frustration. I'm leaning towards B (No) because the author tried to address the issue politely and then left when the employee was handling the correction, which might have been a reasonable decision to avoid further conflict, especially if the employee was being error-prone or not handling it well. But maybe A is the answer if the author should have waited to see the correction. Hmm. Need to think more.\n"
