She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) was wrong for leaving the deli girl in confusion after a pricing dispute.\n\nFirst, the situation: The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave 1.745 lbs but charged $6.98/lb. The customer pointed out the discrepancy. The employee said the price had increased but didn't update the sign. Then, when the customer noted the weight was over a pound, the employee took the meat back, removed slices, and tried to rebag it. The customer left without saying a word.\n\nSo, the customer is upset because they were overcharged and had to deal with an employee who seems confused or not helpful. The key points here are the incorrect pricing and the employee's handling of the situation. \n\nThe customer politely pointed out the mistake and then the employee tried to fix it by taking out slices, but it seems like the process was confusing and perhaps not resolving the issue. The customer's frustration is understandable, especially if the employee wasn't clear or helpful. \n\nNow, the customer walked out without speaking to a manager. The question is whether they were wrong. In many customer service scenarios, when there's a mistake, the customer is expected to either wait for a resolution or ask to speak to a manager. However, the customer might feel that the employee wasn't capable of resolving it properly, so leaving without further action could be seen as justified if they felt it was a waste of time or if the employee wasn't addressing the issue correctly.\n\nOn the other hand, the customer could have been more patient, especially since the employee might have been making an honest mistake. But given the employee's confusion and the customer's irritation, walking out might be seen as a reasonable reaction to avoid a confrontation. \n\nThe main factors here are the employee's failure to correctly price the item and the customer's reaction. Since the employee admitted the price had changed and tried to adjust the weight, the mistake was on the store's side. The customer pointing out the mistake was correct, but leaving without resolving it could be seen as not holding the store accountable. However, the customer's frustration is valid, and sometimes people choose not to escalate the issue if they feel it's not worth the hassle.\n\nIn conclusion, the customer might not be entirely in the wrong because the store made an error. However, leaving without trying to resolve it might be seen as not following up properly. But given the employee's confusion and the customer's irritation, it's a bit of a gray area. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the mistake was the store's, and the customer's reaction was a result of that.\n"
