She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer, the author, leaves the employee with a pile of meat after a dispute over pricing and weight.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb, but the employee gave them 1.745lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The author pointed out the mistake, and the employee initially didn't acknowledge it, leading to frustration. The employee then tried to reweigh the meat by taking out slices and putting them back, but the author got so annoyed that they left without saying anything, leaving the employee with the meat.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The employee made a pricing error, which is a common issue in retail. The author correctly pointed out the discrepancy. The employee's response was dismissive, not immediately correcting the error. The author's frustration is understandable given the situation. However, the author left without resolving the issue, which could be seen as abrupt. But was it wrong?\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the store made a mistake, and the employee failed to correct it initially. The author's actions were a reaction to the employee's handling of the situation. The author didn't confront the manager or escalate the issue, which might have been a better approach. However, the author's decision to leave might be seen as understandable given the stress and the desire to just get their groceries without further conflict.\n\nPotential angles to consider: Did the author have a duty to resolve the issue? Or was it acceptable to walk away when the employee was not cooperating? The author wasn't stealing; they were trying to get the correct price. The employee's actions of removing the meat and reweighing it improperly might have been the final straw. The author's frustration is justified, but leaving the meat behind could be seen as leaving a mess for the employee. However, the employee was in the process of correcting it, so maybe the author's departure wasn't the worst response.\n\nAnother angle: The author didn't take the meat they were initially given, so perhaps they weren't trying to pay for the incorrect amount. The employee was trying to fix it, but the author's impatience led them to leave. In this case, the author might not be in the wrong because they were standing up for their correct purchase and couldn't handle the employee's response. But leaving without resolution could be seen as impolite or inconsiderate. However, given the employee's confusion and incorrect handling of the situation, the author's actions might be justified.\n\nI think the key here is that the employee made a mistake and didn't initially correct it, leading to the author's frustration. The author's decision to leave was impulsive but not necessarily wrong, considering the circumstances. The store is responsible for their pricing errors, and the employee's handling of the situation was poor. The author's reaction, while abrupt, is a common response when dealing with customer service issues and wanting to avoid conflict. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
