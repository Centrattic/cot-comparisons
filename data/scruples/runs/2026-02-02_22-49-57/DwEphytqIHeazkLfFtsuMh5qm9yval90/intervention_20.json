She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a deli counter interaction where there's a pricing and weight discrepancy. The author left without saying anything after a frustrating exchange with the employee.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb, but was given 1.745lbs at $6.98/lb. The employee initially said the price had increased but hadn't updated the sign. Then, when the customer pointed out the weight was over a pound, the employee questioned where it said that, leading to a back-and-forth. The customer then left without completing the transaction.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if that's accurate. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nSo, what's the key here? The customer noticed a mistake in both price and weight. The employee's response was unhelpful, and the customer got fed up. The customer didn't escalate the issue by talking to a manager but walked out. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, the customer's intention was to buy groceries at the correct price. The deli made a mistake, and the employee's response was dismissive or unclear. The customer had the right to question the pricing and weight. However, when the employee started rebagging and adjusting the weight, maybe the customer could have waited for the correct amount. But the employee was altering the product (tearing slices) to make it fit the price. \n\nThe customer's reaction was frustration leading to leaving. Was that appropriate? Well, the customer wasn't in the wrong for pointing out the error, but walking out without addressing it could be seen as not handling the situation properly. However, the employee's behavior might have been unprofessional, causing the customer to lose patience. \n\nFrom a consumer rights perspective, the customer is entitled to the correct price and weight. The employee's admission that the price had increased without changing the sign is a store error. The customer's right to leave the situation is understandable if the employee was uncooperative. \n\nBut in terms of responsibility, the customer might have been expected to either accept the correct amount once it was being rebagged or to escalate if there was continued resistance. However, since the employee was actively changing the product, maybe the customer felt it was too much. \n\nIn this case, the customer's actions, while abrupt, may not be wrong. The employee's handling of the situation was poor, leading to the customer's frustration. So the answer is likely B (no, not in the wrong).\n"
