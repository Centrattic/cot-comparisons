She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a deli counter where the customer is charged more than expected. The author went to get a pound of turkey meat, but ended up with over a pound and a higher price. The employee was confused and tried to correct it, but the author left in frustration.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The employee initially gave them 1.745 lbs at $6.98/lb instead of the $3.98/lb the author expected. The author pointed out the price discrepancy and the weight being over a pound. The employee said the price had gone up but didn't update the sign. Then the employee tried to take the meat back and rebag it with fewer slices. The author got so frustrated they left without saying a word.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, the employee made a mistake with the price and the weight. The author was polite in pointing it out. The employee's response was dismissive and confusing, which led to the author's irritation. The employee then tried to fix it by taking the meat back, but the author lost patience and left. \n\nThe author's actions: They didn't confront the employee further, didn't escalate to a manager, just left. The question is whether they were wrong to do so. On one hand, leaving without addressing the issue might seem abrupt. But considering the employee's confusion and the author's frustration, maybe it's understandable. The author could have left a note or something, but they didn't. However, the main issue was the employee's mistake, not the customer's behavior. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the deli made an error. The customer pointed it out. The employee was unhelpful. The author's frustration is valid. Leaving without a word might be rude, but the alternatives (arguing, waiting for a manager) might have been more time-consuming. The author's priority was to get groceries, not to engage in a confrontation. \n\nSo I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The employee made the mistake, the author tried to resolve it politely, and the frustration was justified. Leaving was a personal choice in a stressful situation, and not necessarily wrong.\n"
