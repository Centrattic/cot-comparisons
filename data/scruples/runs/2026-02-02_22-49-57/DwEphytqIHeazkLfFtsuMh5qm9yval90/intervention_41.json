She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused after a pricing and weight issue. \n\nFirst, the situation: The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave 1.745lbs but charged $6.98/lb. The customer noticed the mistake, pointed it out, and the employee tried to fix it by taking out the meat and rebagging it. The customer then left without saying anything else.\n\nSo, the key points here are the employee's actions. The employee initially said the price was $3.98 but actually charged $6.98. Then, when the customer pointed out the weight discrepancy, the employee started taking out the meat, but instead of just adjusting the weight to 1lb, she took out 2 slices, tore another in half, and rebagged. The customer felt this was incorrect and walked out.\n\nThe customer's reaction: They were polite, tried to correct the mistake, but then lost patience when the employee didn't seem to be resolving it properly. They left the meat and walked out. \n\nNow, is the customer in the wrong? Well, the employee made a pricing error and then a weighing error. The customer was trying to get the correct amount and price. When the employee didn't handle it correctly, the customer left. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the store's fault is the employee's mistake. The customer isn't obligated to stay and argue if they feel the situation isn't being resolved. The customer's irritation is understandable given the confusion and potential overcharge. The employee's method of adjusting the weight by tearing slices might not be accurate, so the customer walking out isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nHowever, the customer didn't mention the overcharge part, just the weight. But the employee might not have corrected the price either. The customer might have been right to leave since the employee wasn't being helpful. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No). The customer isn't in the wrong for leaving after the employee's mistakes and inability to resolve the issue properly.\n"
