She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a deli counter where the customer is upset about being overcharged.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee gave them 1.745 lbs but charged at $6.98 per pound. The customer pointed out the discrepancy, and the employee explained the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then the employee tried to fix it by giving less meat, but the customer left in frustration.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the employee made a mistake in pricing and weight. The customer was polite initially, then became irritated when the employee didn't address the issue properly. The employee tried to correct it by giving a smaller portion, but the customer felt wronged and left. The key points here are the employee's error and the customer's reaction.\n\nThe customer didn't escalate the issue to a manager, which could have been an option. However, the situation was frustrating\u2014price discrepancies, incorrect weight, and a dismissive employee. The customer's decision to leave might be seen as a personal choice, especially if they felt their time was being wasted. The employee's actions were unprofessional, so the customer's frustration is understandable. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for leaving, especially since they tried to resolve it politely first. The answer is B (No).\n"
