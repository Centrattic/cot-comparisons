She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer ended up with a heavier and more expensive product than expected. The customer left without saying a word to the confused deli employee. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sequence of events. The customer asked for 1 pound of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The deli girl sliced it and asked if it's okay if it's a little over. The customer agreed. Then the customer was given a package that weighed 1.745 pounds and was priced at $6.98 per pound, totaling $12.18. That's a significant increase in both weight and price.\n\nThe deli employee initially said the price had gone up but didn't update the sign. Then when the customer pointed out the weight discrepancy, the employee questioned where the weight was mentioned. The customer got irritated and the employee tried to rebag the product by removing meat. The customer then left without finishing the interaction.\n\nNow, the question is whether the customer is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The customer pointed out the mistake politely first. The employee was incorrect about the price and then had to correct the weight. The customer's patience broke, leading them to leave. \n\nFrom a customer service perspective, the employee's actions were problematic. The initial error in pricing and weight, followed by defensiveness and not properly addressing the issue, likely contributed to the customer's frustration. It's possible the employee was confused or made a mistake, but the customer was within their right to question the pricing and weight, which are important financial aspects.\n\nWhen the employee tried to rebag the product, the customer's decision to leave, while abrupt, might be seen as a reaction to the employee's handling of the situation. The customer mentioned they didn't want to escalate it by talking to a manager, so they walked out instead. \n\nHowever, walking away without completing the transaction might be seen as not giving the employee a chance to resolve the issue. The customer could have asked to speak to a manager or waited for the employee to correct the mistake. But the employee's behavior (questioning the weight, being defensive) might have made the customer feel that further interaction was unproductive.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the customer isn't necessarily in the wrong for pointing out the mistake and being frustrated with the incorrect charge. The deli employee made errors and didn't handle the situation professionally. The customer's decision to leave, while abrupt, might be a personal choice rather than a moral wrong. The customer's actions were a reaction to the employee's mistakes and unhelpful responses.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong), as the customer had valid reasons for their frustration and the employee's actions contributed to the situation. The customer was within their rights to question the pricing and leave if they felt their concerns weren't being adequately addressed.\n"
