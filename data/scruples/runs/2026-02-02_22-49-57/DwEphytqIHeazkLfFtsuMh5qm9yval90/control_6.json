She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused and without saying a word. The situation involves a pricing mistake.\n\nFirst, the author asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98, but the deli employee charged $6.98 per pound. The author pointed out the mistake, and the employee said the price had gone up but didn't update the sign. Then the author noticed the weight was over 1.7 pounds and mentioned it. The employee tried to correct it by taking out some meat and reweighing, but the author left in frustration.\n\nSo, the key points here. The employee made a pricing error. The author tried to correct it politely, then the employee was dismissive. The author then walked out without paying. But the author did point out the mistake, which shows they weren't trying to cheat. The employee's response was unhelpful and confusing. The author's actions were impulsive, but they were reacting to being overcharged. \n\nHowever, the author didn't follow through with resolving the issue. Instead of asking to speak to a manager or clarifying further, they left. That could be seen as abandoning the employee, who was just doing their job. The employee might not have known how to handle it properly, but the author's reaction was abrupt. \n\nOn the other hand, the employee's behavior was unprofessional. They didn't acknowledge the weight discrepancy and tried to resolve it by taking out meat, which the author found unacceptable. The author's frustration is understandable, but walking out without paying is not a typical response. \n\nThe deli girl might be in the wrong for the pricing and weight mistake, but the author's action of leaving without paying could be considered wrong as well. However, the author did attempt to address the issue. Maybe the right approach was to either ask for the correct charge or speak to a manager. But since the employee was incorrect about the price, the author wasn't obligated to pay the higher amount. \n\nSo, the author's main mistake was not completing the transaction. But the reason was because of the employee's error. The author could have said, \"I don't accept the incorrect price, so I'll have to cancel the purchase,\" which would be more constructive. Instead, they left the employee with the meat and walked out. \n\nIn terms of social norms, leaving without paying, even if there's a mistake, is not acceptable. However, the employee's error was significant. The author might have been within their rights to not pay the incorrect amount, but the method of doing so by just walking out could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer depends on whether their action of leaving without paying is considered acceptable. Since they didn't confront the manager or clarify, but the employee was at fault, maybe the author isn't in the wrong but their method was poor. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I think the author's actions were inconsiderate but not necessarily wrong in terms of the pricing error. However, the act of leaving without paying is definitely not okay. Wait, but the author didn't pay at all? Or did they pay the $12.18? The original story says the author walked out, so they didn't pay. So, the author didn't pay for the meat. If the price was actually $6.98, then maybe they should have paid, but if the employee made a mistake, the author could have asked to pay the correct amount. \n\nBut the key is that the author didn't communicate clearly. They just walked out, which could be seen as abandoning the employee in a difficult situation. The employee might have been confused and just wanted to do her job, but the author's reaction was extreme. However, the employee's actions were unprofessional. The author's actions were impulsive but not malicious. \n\nIn the end, the author's choice to not pay and walk out isn't the best approach, but it's not necessarily their fault. The employee was wrong. But the author's method of handling it might be seen as the problem. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would be B (No) because the employee made the mistake, and the author had a right to question it and leave if not satisfied. The author's frustration is justified, and the employee's behavior was unhelpful. The author isn't the asshole for standing up for themselves, even if the method was abrupt.\n"
