She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer ended up leaving without resolving the issue. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee gave them 1.745lbs but charged the higher price of $6.98 per pound. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee tried to correct it by removing meat, but the customer got frustrated and left.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the employee made a pricing error and a weight error. The customer noticed and tried to address it. The employee's response was to question the customer and then attempt to fix it by reducing the amount, but the method might have been abrupt or unclear. The customer, feeling disrespected or frustrated, left without finishing the interaction.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key factors are whether the customer acted appropriately when they realized the problem. The customer did point out the mistake politely, but when the employee didn't immediately acknowledge it, they got irritated. The employee then tried to repackage, which might have been confusing or unsatisfactory. The customer left, not wanting to escalate to the manager.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the customer's primary responsibility is to address the issue. Leaving without resolving it could be seen as abandoning the problem, but perhaps the customer felt it wasn't worth the hassle. However, the employee was making errors, so the customer isn't entirely at fault. The employee's job is to handle such situations professionally, which she didn't do. \n\nIs the customer wrong for not staying to resolve it? Maybe not. They were within their rights to question the charge. The employee's behavior (arguing the weight, then trying to repackage in a confusing way) might have justified the customer's frustration. So the answer might be B (No), as the customer isn't in the wrong for walking out given the employee's mishandling. But I need to make sure. The customer could have asked to speak to a manager, but they chose not to. However, the employee's actions were incorrect, so the customer's reaction is understandable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
