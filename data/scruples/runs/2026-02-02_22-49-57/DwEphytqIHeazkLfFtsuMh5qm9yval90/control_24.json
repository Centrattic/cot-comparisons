She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole in this situation. The scenario is about a deli counter interaction where the customer ends up being overcharged.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee sliced the meat and said it might be a little over, but the customer agreed. The customer was expecting a thinner slice since the price is lower. But the employee gave them 1.745lbs at $6.98 per pound. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee denied it initially but then tried to fix it by cutting the meat. The customer then left without saying anything, feeling irritated.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the employee made a pricing error, perhaps by using the wrong price for the meat. The customer noticed the mistake and tried to correct it. The employee was uncooperative at first, but then attempted to rebag the meat. The customer left, not wanting to escalate the situation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the customer did try to point out the mistake and was given an incorrect amount of meat for a higher price. The employee's response that the price had gone up but the sign wasn't changed might be an excuse. The customer might have felt frustrated because the employee was dismissive or not helpful enough. The customer didn't confront the manager, which they could have done, but their reaction was to leave without paying the higher amount. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the store made an error in pricing and quantity. The customer had a right to correct that. The employee's behavior might have been rude or unprofessional. The customer's exit without clarifying the total price could be seen as abrupt, but it's understandable if they were frustrated. The key is whether the customer was wrong to leave. Since the store was overcharging, the customer isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
