She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without saying a word. The situation is that the author asked for 1lb of turkey meat, which is supposed to be $3.98 per pound. The girl said the price went up but didn't change the sign, and the package ended up being 1.745 lbs at $6.98 per pound.\n\nFirst, the author pointed out the mistake politely, as they noticed the price discrepancy. The deli girl's response was dismissive, not acknowledging the error. Then she starts rebagging by putting 2 slices, tearing another, and adding half. The author gets frustrated, puts down the basket, and walks out. They don't want to escalate by asking for the manager.\n\nThe user's perspective is that they're not in the wrong because the deli employee made a mistake. The user emphasizes the employee's confusion and the author's lost patience. But is the author at fault here?\n\nWell, the author did point out the error. The employee's actions (rebagging with less meat but higher per-pound price) might be an attempt to fix the mistake. However, the author's reaction was to walk out without completing the transaction. The question is about whether the author acted appropriately.\n\nIn such situations, customers usually have the right to correct pricing errors. The employee might have been trying to adjust the weight and price. The author could have asked for clarification again or approached the manager if the employee wasn't helpful. Walking out might not be ideal because it leaves the employee in a tough spot, but the employee's initial mistake was a significant issue. The author's frustration is understandable, but maybe they could have handled it with more communication. However, the employee was the one who made the error and then was dismissive. The author's choice to leave might be justified as they were unhappy with the service and the error wasn't resolved. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
