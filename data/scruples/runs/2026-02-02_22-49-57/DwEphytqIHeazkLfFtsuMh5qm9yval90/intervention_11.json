She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the person went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745 lbs but charged $6.98 per pound, which is way more expensive. The person pointed out the mistake, and the employee said the price had gone up but the sign wasn't updated. Then the employee tried to measure it again, but the customer got frustrated and left.\n\nHmm, first, the employee made a pricing error. The customer noticed that the price was wrong, so they're trying to correct it. The employee's response that the price increased but the sign wasn't updated\u2014that might be the store's issue. The customer is being polite but clearly confused and upset. The employee then tries to measure the weight again, but takes out the meat, cuts slices, etc., which seems like they're trying to fix it. The customer, after being frustrated, just leaves without saying a word. \n\nIs the customer in the wrong? Well, the employee made the mistake first. The customer tried to point it out. The employee didn't handle it well. The customer left in frustration, which might be understandable given the situation. The customer didn't escalate it by asking for a manager, which they could have done, but some people just don't want to deal with the hassle. \n\nBut did the customer have the right to leave without resolving it? Maybe. They paid for the correct amount? Wait, the original request was 1lb at $3.98. The employee gave 1.745 lbs at $6.98. So the total was $12.18, which is way overpriced. The customer noticed this and tried to correct it. The employee tried to fix it but maybe not in the right way. The customer left, perhaps because they were tired of dealing with the confusion and the employee's lack of clarity. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the store is responsible for accurate pricing and weight. The customer is trying to hold them accountable. The employee's response was inadequate. The customer's frustration is justified. So leaving without resolving might be a bad customer experience, but the customer isn't the one in the wrong here. The store made the error. The customer's reaction, while abrupt, is a response to the employee's poor handling. So I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
