She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a deli counter where the customer is upset about the price and weight of the meat. The author went to get 1lb of turkey, which is supposed to be $3.98 per pound. But they ended up with 1.745 lbs priced at $6.98 per pound, making it way more expensive. The deli employee said the price had gone up but the sign wasn't changed. The author pointed out the weight discrepancy, and the employee tried to fix it by taking out meat, but the author just left in frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the author did something wrong. The key points here are the price discrepancy and the weight. The price per pound was supposed to be $3.98, but the employee charged $6.98, which is a big difference. The employee also gave more weight than requested, which is confusing. The author politely pointed out the mistake, and the employee tried to correct it, but maybe not in a way the author found satisfactory.\n\nThe author left without saying a word, which the title says they left the deli girl confused. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the customer's perspective, the employee made a mistake in pricing and weight. The author tried to correct it, but the employee's actions (like tearing a slice and rebagging) might not have resolved the issue clearly. The author was frustrated and left, which is understandable given the confusion and the time it's taking. \n\nBut is leaving without paying or without resolving the issue wrong? The author didn't mention not paying. They just left after the employee tried to fix it. If the author didn't pay, that's definitely wrong. But the story says they just walked out, possibly without completing the transaction. The deli girl might have been holding the meat, which the author didn't take, so maybe they didn't pay at all. That would make the author wrong because they left without paying for the meat. However, the original question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the employee confused. \n\nIf the author left without completing the transaction, then they didn't pay, which is wrong. But if they had already paid, then maybe not. The story is a bit unclear on whether payment was made. The author says they left the shopping basket on the ground and walked out. If they didn't pay, that's theft. If they did pay, then maybe not. The story doesn't explicitly say whether the author paid or not. \n\nAssuming they didn't pay, then the author is in the wrong. If they did pay and just left without saying thanks, maybe not. But the key part is the employee tried to correct the weight and price, and the author just walked out. The author might have been within their right to demand a correct price, but leaving without resolving it could be seen as abandoning the purchase. However, if the employee was trying to fix it and the author was just frustrated, maybe it's a situation where the author's actions were understandable but abrupt. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author left without paying, then yes. If they did pay, then no. The story says the author \"left the door\" after the employee tried to give a corrected bag. The original transaction might not have been completed. Typically, in a deli, you pay after the counter. So if the author left before paying, they didn't pay. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they left without paying for the meat. The confusion and frustration might be understandable, but not paying is wrong. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
