She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli employee who messed up the pricing and weight of the meat. The author left without saying anything, which is the main issue.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The deli girl gave them 1.745lbs but charged them $6.98 per pound, which is a higher price. The author pointed out the mistake, and the employee tried to correct it by re-weighing and cutting slices. But the author got frustrated and left without paying the correct amount.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they did notice the error and tried to address it. The employee admitted the price had increased but didn't update the sign, leading to the confusion. The author was being polite but was clearly upset by the employee's actions, like tearing up the meat and reweighing. Walking out without paying might be seen as abandoning the employee with the product, but the author might have felt that the situation was too frustrating to handle.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author intentionally leave without paying? It seems like they wanted to correct the issue but couldn't handle the employee's manner. However, leaving the meat behind without resolving the payment issue could be problematic. The employee might have expected the author to pay the correct amount, even if it was a mistake. So, the author might be at fault for not completing the transaction properly. On the other hand, the employee's actions were unprofessional, which could justify the author's frustration. But the act of leaving without paying is still a problem. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they left without settling the payment, even if the employee made a mistake.\n"
