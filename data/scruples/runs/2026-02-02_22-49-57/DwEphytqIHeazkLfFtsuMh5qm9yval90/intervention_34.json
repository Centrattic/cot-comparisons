She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the original poster (OP) is the asshole for leaving the deli girl confused. So, the situation is that OP went to the deli, ordered 1 lb of turkey at $3.98/lb, but the employee gave them 1.745 lbs priced at $6.98. OP noticed the mistake, pointed it out, and then got into a back-and-forth where the employee didn't seem to understand. Eventually, OP left without finishing the interaction.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if OP did something wrong. Let's break it down step by step. \n\nOP asked for 1 lb of turkey at a specific price. The employee sliced it, mentioned it might be a bit over, and OP agreed. But then the weight came out as almost double, and the price was higher than expected. OP pointed out the discrepancy, which is reasonable. The employee said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then OP challenged the weight, and the employee seemed confused. \n\nNow, the employee's actions: maybe she misread the price or made a mistake in weighing. But OP was polite at first, then became irritated. The employee tried to reweigh it by taking out slices, tearing one in half, and rebagging. OP then left without saying anything, which left the employee with the meat. \n\nIs OP's reaction justified? Well, OP had the right to question the price and weight. The employee's confusion might have made the situation tense. OP's frustration is understandable, especially if they felt the employee was not helping. However, walking out without explaining or returning the meat could be seen as leaving the employee in a tough spot. \n\nBut wait, OP was trying to buy groceries and got fed up. In customer service, sometimes employees are the front line, and customers might take out their frustration on them. The employee might not have the authority to fix the issue, but OP could have asked to speak to a manager. However, OP specifically said they didn't want to be that guy. \n\nSo, is OP in the wrong? The key points are: Did OP handle it appropriately? Leaving the situation without resolution might be impolite, but the employee's confusion and possible mistake could have contributed to OP's frustration. Alternatively, OP could have waited for a manager. But the question is if OP is in the wrong. \n\nIn many cases, people argue that standing up for yourself is okay if you're right. However, leaving the employee with the meat might be considered inconsiderate. But given the employee's own confusion, maybe OP's actions were a reaction to poor service. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not the Asshole) because OP was dealing with a confusing and possibly incorrect situation and chose to walk out rather than escalate. It's a matter of personal frustration, but they aren't necessarily at fault for the employee's mistake. However, maybe there's a better way to handle it, but the question is if they're in the wrong. So, probably B."
