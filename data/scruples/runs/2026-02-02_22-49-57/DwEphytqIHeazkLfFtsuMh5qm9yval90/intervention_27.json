She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused and without saying a word. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli employee gave them 1.745lbs but charged $6.98/lb. The author pointed out the mistake, and the employee said the price had gone up but didn't update the sign. Then, the author asked about the weight, which was over a pound. The employee tried to re-weigh it but ended up with 2 slices and a half, which seems like even less. The author then left without finishing the interaction.\n\nSo, the main points are: the employee made a pricing error, then a weighing error. The author tried to correct both but got annoyed and left. The question is whether the author was wrong in doing so.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were trying to get the correct price and weight. The employee was confusing and possibly incorrect in their actions. The author might have felt frustrated because the employee was not resolving the issue properly. However, the author didn't confront the manager or resolve the issue, which could be seen as not following up properly.\n\nBut the employee was also at fault for the initial mistakes. The author's irritation is understandable. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for leaving suddenly. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to consider if the author's actions were reasonable. Walking out when frustrated is a common reaction, especially if the employee was unhelpful. The author might have felt it's not worth the hassle. On the other hand, not resolving the issue could be seen as not being responsible. But given the employee's errors and the author's polite attempts to address them, the author's decision to leave might be justified. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
