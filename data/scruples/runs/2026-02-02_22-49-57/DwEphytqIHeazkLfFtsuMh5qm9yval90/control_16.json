She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer left without resolving a pricing and weight discrepancy.\n\nFirst, the author went to the deli, ordered 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745lbs but at $6.98/lb, which is way more expensive. The sign says $3.98, but the employee says the price went up. The author points out the weight is over a pound as well. The employee starts rebagging by putting 2 slices, tearing another, and putting half. The author then leaves without saying anything else.\n\nSo, I need to determine if the author is wrong for not dealing with the situation. Let's break it down. The deli employee made a mistake in pricing, charging the higher price without updating the sign. The author caught that and also noticed the weight was more. The employee is trying to fix it by reducing the amount, but maybe not in the right way. The author's actions: politely pointing out the mistake, then getting irritated, and finally leaving. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, they did address the error directly. The employee might be trying to handle it by giving less meat, but the author's main issue is the overcharge. If the employee was trying to give back the correct amount after adjusting the weight, maybe the author could have waited. But the employee was taking out the meat and rebagging, which might have been confusing. The author left because they were frustrated, but maybe not wrong. However, leaving without resolving the issue could be seen as not being a good customer. Should they have asked for a manager or clarified further? \n\nOn the other hand, the employee's actions might be unprofessional. The author was right to question the price and weight. The employee's response about the price increase not being updated on the sign is a common mistake, but they should have double-checked the correct price before charging. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if the employee was dismissive. Walking out might be impolite, but the author's intention was to deal with the issue. \n\nBut maybe the author should have handled it more calmly. However, given the situation, the author might have felt the employee wasn't taking it seriously. The key points are that the customer was correct about the price and weight, the employee made a mistake, and the customer left before the issue was resolved. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often judge based on whether the customer tried to resolve the problem respectfully. The author did point out the mistake, but left out of frustration. The employee might have been trying to fix it, but the author didn't stay to see the resolution. So the author could be seen as not giving the employee a chance to correct it properly, but the employee also wasn't handling it well. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the customer was right to question the error and left because the employee's response was inadequate. The customer's frustration is justified, and leaving without further confrontation isn't necessarily wrong. The employee is at fault for the mistake and not handling it smoothly. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
