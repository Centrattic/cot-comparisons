She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli counter without speaking to a manager after a pricing and weight issue. \n\nFirst, the scenario: The customer asked for 1lb of oven-roasted turkey at $3.98 per pound. The deli girl sliced the meat, which was very thin, and the total came out to 1.745 lbs at $6.98 per pound, totaling $12.18. The customer politely pointed out the discrepancy, and the deli girl explained that the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then the customer mentioned the weight was over a pound, and the deli girl asked where that was indicated. The customer became irritated, the deli girl took out the meat, put 2 slices in the bag, tore another and added half, then tried to give it back. The customer, upset, put the basket down and left without further interaction.\n\nSo, the key points here are pricing and weight accuracy. The customer paid for 1lb at $3.98, but got over 1.7lbs at $6.98, which is a significant difference. The deli girl's actions resulted in the customer paying almost three times the expected price. The customer tried to correct the pricing first, and then the weight. The deli girl's response to the weight\u2014asking where it says that\u2014seems dismissive. Then when she reweighs, she's cutting the slices, which might imply she's trying to adjust the weight to match the 1lb requested, but the customer left before resolving it.\n\nLegally, the store should charge according to the actual weight and the correct price. If the sign is incorrect, the store is responsible for that error. However, the customer's frustration is understandable. The total overcharge is $12.18 - $3.98 = $8.20, but since the weight was over 1.7lbs at the new price of $6.98, the correct price should be around 1.745 * 6.98 \u2248 $12.18, but the customer was expecting $3.98 for 1lb. If the price increased, the store should adjust the total accordingly. However, the deli girl might have overcompensated by giving too much meat, leading to a higher total.\n\nThe customer's reaction: They were polite initially, but after the deli girl's dismissive attitude, they left. The customer didn't escalate to a manager, which is a possible point of contention. But given the time of day (maybe busy or just wanting to finish shopping quickly), they might have felt the interaction was too stressful or time-consuming.\n\nIs the customer in the wrong? They tried to correct the price first, then the weight. If the deli girl is making a mistake, the customer has a right to question it. However, leaving without resolving the issue might leave the problem unaddressed. But the customer's frustration is valid because they were overcharged. The deli girl's behavior\u2014asking where the weight was indicated, tearing the meat\u2014could be seen as unprofessional or dismissive.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the store is at fault for not updating the price sign. However, the customer has the right to request the correct amount and price. The customer's actions were in response to the employee's unhelpful behavior, not directly at the employee. So, while the customer left without speaking to a manager, their initial request was correct, and the employee's response was the issue. Therefore, the customer isn't in the wrong for leaving in frustration, especially if they don't want to escalate the situation.\n"
