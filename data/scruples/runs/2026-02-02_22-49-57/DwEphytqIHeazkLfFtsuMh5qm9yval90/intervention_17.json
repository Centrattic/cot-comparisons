She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong for leaving the deli counter without saying a word. The situation involves a pricing and weight discrepancy.\n\nFirst, the author went to the deli and asked for 1lb of oven roasted turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli girl didn't change the price sign when the price went up to $6.98, so she charged the higher rate. The author points out the weight is 1.745 lbs instead of 1, which the deli girl acknowledges but tries to fix by removing some meat. She takes the original bag, reduces the meat to 2 slices plus a half-slice, then charges $12.18 for that. The author is upset and leaves without saying anything.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The deli girl made a mistake in pricing and weight. The author correctly points out the discrepancy, which the deli girl then tries to fix in a way that seems unsatisfactory. The author's reaction is to leave without paying, which could be seen as abandoning the transaction. But maybe they left without paying? Wait, the story says they \"just walked out the door.\" So the author didn't pay for the meat, which is now in the deli girl's hands. \n\nIf the author left without paying, that's a problem. Because even if there was a mistake, taking the product without paying is theft. The deli girl might have made a mistake, but the author's responsibility is to handle the situation properly. The author could have asked to speak to a manager, or at least left the item there and walked out. By taking the basket and just walking out, they're leaving the deli employee with the meat, which she might not have been able to return or handle. \n\nBut wait, the author says they \"left a pile of meat holding it without saying a word.\" Hmm, maybe the author left the basket with the meat? The wording is a bit unclear. The story says they put the basket down and walked out. If the basket was left there with the meat, then the author didn't take the meat. But the original meat they had was taken by the deli girl. The user says \"leaving a very confused deli girl holding a pile of meat,\" which might mean the author left, and the deli girl had the meat. But the key is the author's actions. \n\nIf the author left the meat with the deli girl and didn't pay, then they are in the wrong because they didn't resolve the issue. However, if they were walking out but didn't take the meat, maybe they just left the basket and walked away without the meat. The story says the deli girl tried to hand it to them after rebagging, and the author \"looked right through her\" and walked out. So the author didn't take the meat from her, but they had already left the original meat there. The confusion is about whether the author paid or not. \n\nAssuming the author left without paying, that's theft. But if they just walked out and didn't take the meat, they might not have paid. The deli girl might have kept the meat, but the author's responsibility is to ensure they don't overpay or underpay. The correct action would be to not accept the item and then go to the manager to resolve the issue. By leaving the situation, the author is avoiding responsibility. \n\nSo the author's error is in not following up properly. They should have either accepted the correct amount or left the meat and walked out without taking it. Since the story mentions the author left the basket on the ground and walked out, maybe they didn't take the meat. But the deli girl had already taken the original meat and was trying to adjust it. The author's action of not paying and leaving could be seen as wrong because they didn't handle the situation appropriately. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author was just frustrated and left, but the deli girl ended up with the meat. In that case, the author didn't pay and left the employee in a tough spot. Even if the price was wrong, the author should have either accepted the corrected amount or left the meat and not taken it. Not paying and walking out is not okay. The deli girl might have been confused, but the author's responsibility is to handle the transaction properly. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they left the deli without resolving the issue and without paying, which is not acceptable. They should have either paid for the correct amount or left the meat and walked away, not just left the employee with the meat and no payment.\n"
