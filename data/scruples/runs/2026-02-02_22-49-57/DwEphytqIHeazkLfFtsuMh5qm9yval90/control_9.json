She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without speaking to her. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98 per pound. The deli employee sliced it, then said the price had gone up but didn't mention the new price. The author noticed the bag was priced at $6.98 per pound for 1.745 lbs, which is way over the requested amount. When the author pointed this out, the employee tried to repackage it with just a few slices, leading the author to walk out.\n\nSo, the author is upset because the deli overcharged them. The employee made a mistake in pricing and quantity. The author tried to address it politely, got into a confusing exchange, and then left. They didn't escalate the issue to a manager, which might have been the expected course of action.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Did the author have a valid reason to leave? Did they handle the situation appropriately?\n\nThe deli employee's error is clear\u2014they gave the author over 1.7 pounds of meat at a higher price, not the 1lb at the original price. The author's irritation is understandable because they were overcharged. However, the employee's response was to repackage the meat, which might not have been the right solution. The author didn't confront the manager, which could be seen as not giving the store a chance to correct the mistake. But the author also might have felt that the employee was being dismissive or not handling it properly, leading to their frustration.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the store made a mistake, so the author isn't at fault for that. But by leaving without addressing it further, maybe the store isn't aware of the error, which could let it happen again. However, the author's main issue was being overcharged and not getting the correct amount. If the employee was uncooperative, the author's decision to walk out might be justified. The employee's actions were confusing (removing meat but adding torn slices), which might have been the last straw.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author had a valid reason to be upset and the employee made an error. The author tried to resolve it but the employee's response was not helpful, leading to the author's frustration. Walking out in that situation, especially if the employee wasn't providing a satisfactory solution, isn't necessarily wrong. The store should correct their pricing and training, but the author's actions were a reaction to being overcharged and not receiving clear communication or resolution.\n"
