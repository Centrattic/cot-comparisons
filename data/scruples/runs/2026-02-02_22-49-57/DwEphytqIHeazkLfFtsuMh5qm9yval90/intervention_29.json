She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without saying a word. The story is about a customer who goes to the deli, asks for 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98 per pound, but gets a bagged product priced at $6.98 per pound with over 1.7 pounds. The employee initially says the price went up but didn't update the sign, then gets confused when the customer points out the weight discrepancy.\n\nFirst, the customer's actions: When the customer noticed the price was much higher than expected, they politely informed the employee. The employee's response was confusing, and when the customer pointed out the weight, the employee became defensive (\"where does it say that?\"). Then the employee started re-bagging the meat, adding it in a way that seems arbitrary, maybe trying to make it fit the 1.745lbs. The customer, now irritated, put down their basket and left without further interaction. The question is whether the customer was wrong to do that.\n\nSo, the key points here are the customer's right to accurate pricing and weight, and their reaction when the employee was unhelpful. The customer was paying more than expected, both in price per pound and total weight. The employee's mistake is clear: incorrect pricing and not fulfilling the customer's original request accurately. But when the customer tried to correct it, the employee was dismissive and possibly made things worse by not properly addressing the issue.\n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, if a customer is being overcharged due to an employee's error, they're usually in the right to point it out. However, the customer walked out without resolving the issue, which could be seen as leaving the employee in a difficult spot. But considering the employee's confusion and possible lack of training, the customer might have felt that escalating to a manager would be too time-consuming or that the employee was unresponsive. The customer's decision to leave could be a reaction to frustration but also a way to avoid further conflict, especially if they felt it was a simple mistake and didn't want to be confrontational.\n\nThe customer's actions were initially polite. They tried to correct the error in a respectful manner. The employee's confusion might have been genuine, but the way they handled the customer's concern (deflecting, asking \"where does it say that?\") suggests a lack of proper communication. The customer's irritation is understandable given the situation. Walking out without a word might be abrupt, but if the employee was uncooperative or if the customer felt it was a lost cause, it's not entirely unreasonable. However, the customer could have at least informed the employee of the mistake, even if they decided not to stay. Leaving the person holding the pile of meat confused is part of the issue here.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the store is responsible for accurate pricing and weight, so the customer is justified in pointing out the mistake. The employee's response, however, was unhelpful. The customer's frustration is valid, and walking out might be seen as a justified action given the employee's confusion and the customer's desire to avoid a prolonged and unproductive interaction. The customer could have left a note or informed the manager at the register, but that's not mentioned. The main question is whether the customer was wrong for not dealing with the situation. Since the employee didn't resolve it, and the customer left, the customer isn't necessarily in the wrong. Stores usually handle such errors, but the customer's choice to walk out might be seen as avoiding responsibility, even if the employee was at fault.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the customer was being overcharged and the employee was unresponsive. The customer's frustration is justified, and leaving without further interaction isn't their fault, especially when the employee didn't properly address the issue. The customer isn't responsible for the employee's mistake, and while walking out could be seen as abrupt, the situation seems to justify it given the employee's confusion and the customer's intent to just buy groceries.\n"
