She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without saying a word. The situation involves a pricing and weighing mistake.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli employee gave them 1.745lbs but charged $6.98/lb. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee said the price increased but didn't update the sign. The customer questioned the weight, the employee took the meat, rebagged it by removing slices, but the customer then left without finishing the interaction.\n\nThe customer was polite initially but got irritated when the employee didn't acknowledge the weight discrepancy. The employee's actions of removing slices and reweighing might have been to adjust the weight, but the customer walked out instead of waiting for resolution.\n\nThe key points: Did the customer handle the situation appropriately? The customer didn't escalate to a manager, left the meat, and exited. The employee might have been confused or made a mistake, but the customer's frustration led to an abrupt exit. \n\nConsidering the customer's right to question pricing and the employee's responsibility to correct errors, the customer's impatience and leaving without resolving the issue could be seen as a mistake. However, the employee's confusing behavior and the customer's frustration might justify their reaction. \n\nIn such cases, the customer isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the abrupt exit could be seen as rude. However, the employee's confusion and the customer's right to not engage in a stressful situation might mean the customer's actions are understandable. \n\nWeighing the options, the answer would lean towards the customer not being in the wrong because the employee's behavior and the situation's stress could justify the exit, even if abrupt.\n"
