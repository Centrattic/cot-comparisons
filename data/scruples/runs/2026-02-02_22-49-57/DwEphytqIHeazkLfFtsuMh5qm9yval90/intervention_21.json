She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli worker who messed up the pricing and weight of the meat. The author noticed the error, pointed it out politely, but then the worker tried to fix it in a confusing way. The author walked out without saying anything else. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The worker overfilled it to 1.745 lbs but charged $6.98/lb, which is more than double the price. The author pointed out the mistake. The worker tried to fix it by taking out slices and weighing them, but the process was confusing. The author left in frustration.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. The worker made a mistake in pricing and weight. The author tried to address it politely. The worker's response was unhelpful and possibly incorrect. The author's frustration is understandable. Walking out without further confrontation could be seen as avoiding conflict, but maybe the right action depends on how the worker corrected the error. If the worker was trying to fix it, the author could have waited, but if the worker was just adding slices haphazardly without explaining, maybe the author had a right to leave.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they didn't want to be the guy asking for the manager, so they left. The key question is whether the author had a duty to stay and resolve the issue. But given the worker's confusion and the author's frustration, maybe leaving wasn't the wrong thing to do. The worker was already making a mistake, so the author might not be responsible for the worker's error. The author's actions were in self-defense of their patience. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
