She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer ends up leaving without resolving the issue. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the customer asks for 1 lb of oven-roasted turkey meat at $3.98 per pound, thinly sliced. The employee slices the meat and asks if a little over is okay. The customer agrees. Then, the employee bags it, and the customer notices the price is $12.18 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98 per pound. The customer points out the discrepancy, and the employee says the price increased but the sign wasn't updated. The customer is confused because the weight is more than they asked for, and the employee starts rebagging it, using very few thick slices to get the desired weight. The customer then leaves without saying anything else.\n\nSo, the main issues here are the pricing and the weight. The customer was charged a higher price per pound than the sign indicated, and received more weight than they ordered. The employee made a mistake in pricing, which the customer noticed and pointed out. The employee then tried to adjust the weight to match the customer's original request but in a way that seemed haphazard (tearing slices, putting only a few in the bag). The customer, frustrated, left without resolving the issue.\n\nNow, to determine if the customer is in the wrong. The customer tried to point out the mistake politely, but the employee didn't address it correctly. The employee might have been trying to correct it by taking out the meat and rebagging, but the method was unprofessional. The customer felt that the situation was not being resolved properly and decided to leave. Is there a responsibility to stay and insist on a resolution, like involving a manager? The customer chose not to be the \"\u70e6\u4eba\" (annoying person) and just left. However, the customer could have potentially walked away without paying for the meat, which might be a problem. But in this case, the customer left the meat behind, so maybe they didn't take the overpriced product. However, the main issue is that the customer left the employee holding the meat and didn't resolve the payment issue. If the customer left without paying, that's a problem. But according to the story, the customer put the basket down and walked out. The employee was left with the meat. If the customer had already paid, then leaving the meat might not be an issue. But if they didn't pay, then the customer is in the wrong. Wait, in the story, the customer was given the meat by the employee, noticed the price was wrong, and then the employee tried to rebag it. The customer left before the rebagging was completed. It's unclear if the customer paid for the original overpriced meat. If the customer left the meat with the employee, maybe the employee would have given a refund or adjusted the price. But the customer didn't follow through. The employee might have been trying to correct the mistake, but the customer left. So, the customer didn't pay for the meat, which could be wrong. Alternatively, if the customer was just leaving the meat and not taking it, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. The story says the customer \"put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\" So the basket was left there, implying the customer didn't take the meat. Therefore, perhaps the customer is not in the wrong for leaving the meat behind when the pricing was incorrect. The employee made a mistake, the customer pointed it out, the employee tried to fix it but in a messy way, and the customer couldn't handle the situation anymore and left. In this case, the customer might not be in the wrong because the store made the mistake, and the customer was trying to address it. The employee's behavior was unprofessional, so the customer's frustration is understandable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). However, there's a nuance here. If the customer had already paid for the meat before leaving, then leaving without it would be problematic. But in the story, it seems the customer was in the process of getting the meat rebagged and then left, so it's possible that the customer didn't actually pay for the product yet. Therefore, the customer is not in the wrong for leaving the situation without resolving it, especially if the pricing was incorrect. The store made the mistake, and the customer tried to address it but couldn't handle the employee's response. So the answer is B.\n"
