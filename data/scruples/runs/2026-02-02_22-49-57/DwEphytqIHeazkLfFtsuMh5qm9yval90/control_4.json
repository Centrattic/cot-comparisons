She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without speaking. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author bought turkey meat, but there was a pricing discrepancy. The employee initially gave 1.745 lbs at $6.98, which is way over the price the author was told ($3.98/lb). The employee tried to explain the price change but didn't fix the weight issue. The author got frustrated, put the basket down, and left.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's consider the employee's actions. She made a mistake in pricing and weight. The author pointed out the error politely. Then the employee tried to correct it by reducing the amount, but maybe not accurately. The author felt the interaction was wrong and left, not dealing with the employee further. \n\nThe key points: Did the author handle it appropriately? If they left without resolving the issue, maybe they could have asked to speak to a manager. But the author mentioned they didn't want to be that guy. However, the employee was already confused and making errors. The author's frustration is understandable, but walking out might have left the employee in a worse spot. But the main issue was the employee's mistake, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
