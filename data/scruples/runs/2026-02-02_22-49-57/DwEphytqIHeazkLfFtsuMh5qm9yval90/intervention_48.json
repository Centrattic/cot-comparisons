She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong after leaving a confused deli employee holding a pile of meat without saying a word. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee sliced it, asked if being a bit over was okay. The author agreed. But the final price was $12.18 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98 per pound. The author points out the price discrepancy and the weight being over a pound. The employee says the price was increased but the sign wasn't changed. The author is confused because the weight is more than requested, and the employee starts rebagging by removing and tearing slices to get to the correct weight. The author then leaves without saying anything, feeling irritated.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the employee made an error in pricing, possibly overcharged the author, and then tried to correct the weight. The author tried to point out the mistake but got frustrated when the employee didn't handle it smoothly. The author left without completing the transaction. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a customer service perspective, the employee made a mistake. The author tried to correct it but got annoyed when the employee wasn't cooperative. The author's frustration is understandable, especially when the employee's actions (tearing the meat, rebagging) might not be resolving the issue. Walking out might be seen as abandoning the situation without resolution. However, the author might have felt that further confrontation with the employee (or manager) was unnecessary or too stressful. \n\nIs the author responsible for the employee's mistake? Probably not. The employee's error in pricing and handling the weight is their responsibility. The author's reaction is a response to the employee's confusion and mishandling. The author's action of leaving is not malicious but a result of losing patience. \n\nIn such situations, it's common for customers to get frustrated if they feel they're being overcharged. The employee's explanation about the price change not being updated on the sign might be an internal issue, but the customer has a right to be informed of the correct price. The author's choice to leave, while not ideal, might not make them the \"asshole\" since the problem was the employee's error. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong)."
