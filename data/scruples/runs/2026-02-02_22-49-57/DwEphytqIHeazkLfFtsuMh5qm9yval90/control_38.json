She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused after she overcharged them. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98. The employee sliced it, said it might be over, but then charged $6.98 per pound for 1.745 lbs totaling $12.18. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee corrected the weight but kept the higher price, and the customer left in frustration without speaking to a manager.\n\nSo, the key points here are the pricing error and the customer's reaction. The deli girl initially said the price had increased but didn't change the sign. So the customer was right to question the price. Then, when the weight was more than requested, the employee adjusted the amount but kept adding slices in a way that seems like she's trying to make up the weight without properly accounting for the original request. The customer felt the employee was being dishonest or at least not handling it correctly, so they left without further confrontation.\n\nNow, considering the customer's actions: They did point out the mistake politely, the employee didn't handle it well, and the customer left in frustration. The user is asking if they're the asshole for not handling this more calmly. \n\nIn situations like this, customers often have the right to question overcharges. The employee's behavior here\u2014torn slices and bagging it without clear explanation\u2014might have made the customer feel disrespected or that the employee was trying to shortchange them again. The customer didn't argue or escalate, just left. \n\nThe options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). The user's reaction, while abrupt, might be understandable given the employee's confusion and possible mishandling. The customer isn't being aggressive, just walking out because they don't want to deal with the stress. The employee's mistake in pricing and the way she handled the weight adjustment could be the main issues here. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B. The author isn't in the wrong for walking out after being corrected and not wanting to deal with the situation further. They tried to address it politely and left when it wasn't resolved satisfactorily. The employee's actions might have contributed to the customer's frustration.\n"
