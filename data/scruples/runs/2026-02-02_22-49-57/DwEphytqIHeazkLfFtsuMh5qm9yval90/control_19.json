She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745 lbs but charged $6.98/lb. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then the customer mentioned the weight was over a pound, the employee asked where it said that. The employee then took the meat back, tried to rebag it by putting 2 slices and half another, making it less than a pound. The customer got fed up and left without saying anything else.\n\nFirst, the employee made a pricing error. The customer is correct in pointing out the discrepancy. The employee's response about the price increase not being on the sign is a possible explanation, but the weight was also wrong. The employee tried to correct the weight by reducing the amount, which seems like they were trying to fix their mistake but in a way that might not be transparent. \n\nThe customer's frustration is understandable. They were already confused and the employee's handling didn't help. Walking out might be impolite, but given the situation, it's a reaction to poor customer service. The question is whether the customer is in the wrong for leaving without further confrontation. The main issue is the employee's error and handling. The customer's actions, while abrupt, might be justified given the employee's unhelpfulness. So the answer is B (No).\n"
