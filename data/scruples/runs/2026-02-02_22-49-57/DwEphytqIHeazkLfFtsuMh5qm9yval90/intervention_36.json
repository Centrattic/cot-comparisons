She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking out on the deli girl without saying anything after a pricing and weight discrepancy. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author went to the deli and asked for 1 pound of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee sliced it, said it might be a bit over, but then charged $6.98/lb for 1.745 pounds. The author pointed out the mistake, the employee claimed the price had gone up but didn't change the sign. Then, when the author mentioned the weight being over a pound, the employee asked where it said that, and the author got irritated. The employee then tried to rebag the meat by taking only a few slices and tearing one in half, which led the author to walk out without dealing with her further.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the employee made a pricing error, overcharged the customer, and then tried to address the weight issue by reducing the amount, which seems like an attempt to correct the mistake but in a manner that might not have been fair. The author was polite initially, but after the employee's confusing responses and actions, they lost patience and left.\n\nNow, considering the options. If the author is in the wrong, it might be because they walked out without trying to resolve the issue, maybe without speaking to a manager or following up. However, the employee was the one who made the mistake, and the author tried to point it out but the employee was uncooperative. The author might have felt that dealing with the employee further was pointless or that they were being disrespected. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have been more patient, but given the employee's confusing and possibly incorrect handling of the situation, maybe the author's frustration is justified. The question is whether the author's reaction is unreasonable. Since the employee was the one who made the error and didn't handle it properly, the author might not be in the wrong for leaving. The answer might be B (No), as the author was trying to get a fair price and the employee's response was inadequate, leading to the author's decision to leave.\n"
