She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused with the meat. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee gave them 1.745lbs but charged $6.98 per pound, making the total $12.18. The author pointed out the discrepancy, and the employee claimed the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. The author was then told the weight was over, and the employee tried to fix it by taking out the meat and weighing only a few slices, which ended up being under a pound. The author then left without saying anything.\n\nSo, the key points here are the pricing and the weight. The original request was for 1lb at $3.98. The employee gave more weight but at a higher price. The author caught the mistake and pointed it out. The employee tried to correct it but ended up giving less, possibly trying to charge the higher rate. The author, frustrated, left without further action.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? The employee made a mistake in pricing and weight. The author tried to correct it politely but became frustrated. The employee's response was unhelpful and possibly misleading. The author left without paying for the incorrect amount, which could be seen as not paying for the overcharged item. But the employee was trying to fix it, so the author might have been trying to avoid paying the higher price. Alternatively, the author could have escalated the issue but chose not to. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the employee made the error. The author's frustration is understandable. However, not paying for the items, even if there was a mistake, might be considered wrong. But the employee was trying to correct it. The author left without saying a word, which might be considered rude, but the situation was tense. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the employee made the mistake first. The author tried to address it, but the employee's response was uncooperative. Walking out might be impolite, but given the circumstances, it's a valid reaction to an ongoing issue where the employee wasn't resolving the problem. So the answer is B.\n"
