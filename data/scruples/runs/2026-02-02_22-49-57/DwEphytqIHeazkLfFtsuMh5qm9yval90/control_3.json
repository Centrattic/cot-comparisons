She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter where they asked for 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98 per pound, but the final price was $12.18 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98. The employee said the price had gone up but the sign wasn't updated. The author was confused, pointed out the weight discrepancy, and the employee had to rebag and reweigh the meat. The author then left without saying anything else.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The customer asked for a specific amount and price. The employee initially said it would be a little over, but the customer agreed. However, the actual weight was 1.745 lbs, and the price was changed to $6.98, which is higher than the $3.98 they were told. The employee made a mistake with the price per pound and the weight. The customer tried to point out the error, the employee then took the meat, weighed only two slices plus a half of another, making the weight less. But when the employee said the price has gone up, maybe the initial weight was higher, so the customer ended up paying more than the correct price for a pound. \n\nThe customer became irritated when the employee questioned the weight. When the employee tore a slice in half and put it on the scale, the customer decided to walk out. The key points here are whether the employee made a pricing error and the customer's reaction. The customer's main issue was the price per pound and the weight. The employee initially said it would be a little over, but the actual weight was 1.745 lbs, which at $3.98 per pound would cost around $6.94, not $12.18. So the employee either applied the wrong price per pound or there was a miscommunication. The customer was trying to correct the price, which is their right. \n\nThe employee's response of not changing the sign yet is an excuse for the price increase. The customer was told the price has gone up, so the initial sign was incorrect. The customer was correct in pointing out the discrepancy. The employee then tried to rebag the meat, but the author noticed that the employee was taking the meat and splitting slices, which might have been to reduce the weight, but the actual weight was already over a pound. \n\nWhen the customer walked out, they didn't confront the manager. The question is if the customer is in the wrong for leaving without further action. They were polite initially, but the employee was being dismissive. The customer's irritation is understandable because they were overcharged. The employee should have handled the situation better, but the customer's action of leaving might be seen as not trying to resolve it. However, the customer's frustration was due to the employee's mistake and their own lack of patience. \n\nThe author didn't yell or cause a scene, just left. They might not be in the wrong for not dealing with a confusing employee, especially if they felt the situation wasn't being resolved. The employee's error in pricing and weight is on them. The customer had the right to point it out and either accept the correct price or walk away. Since they were paying more than what they were quoted, their reaction could be justified. \n\nBut maybe the customer could have been more patient and approached the manager. However, the employee didn't seem to acknowledge the mistake properly. The customer's main fault was not speaking to a manager, but the employee's fault was the initial mistake. So the customer isn't in the wrong for leaving after being corrected, but the employee is at fault. The answer would be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
