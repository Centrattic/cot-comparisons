She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without explaining. The situation is that the customer asked for 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98/lb, but the deli girl gave them 1.745 lbs at $6.98/lb. The customer noticed the price was higher and pointed out the mistake, then the employee tried to correct it by taking out the meat and rebagging it. The customer got so frustrated they just walked out.\n\nFirst, I need to assess who is at fault here. The deli girl made a pricing error. The sign was still showing the old price, but the actual charge was higher. The customer caught that mistake, which is being honest. Then, the employee tried to fix the weight by adding more meat to reach the new price. The customer, now seeing that the weight is almost double what they asked, and the employee not acknowledging the issue, decided to leave.\n\nThe key points here are the employee's error, the customer pointing it out politely, and the employee's response (saying the price went up but not the sign). When the customer questions the weight, the employee becomes defensive and starts rebagging, which causes confusion. The customer's frustration is understandable because they were initially charged more than the listed price, and then the weight is incorrect. The employee's actions might not be malicious, but they are confusing and could be seen as dismissive.\n\nThe author left without saying anything, which might seem abrupt. But considering the situation, they were trying to buy groceries quickly and found the employee's behavior unhelpful. The customer might not be in the wrong here because they were addressing a mistake and felt disrespected. However, walking out without resolution could be seen as not following up properly. Maybe the customer should have asked to speak to a manager instead. But the question is whether the author is \"the asshole.\"\n\nIn these kinds of situations, people often have different thresholds for patience. The customer's actions were a result of frustration with the employee's inconsistency and lack of clear communication. The employee's mistake led to a higher charge, and when the customer pointed out the weight, the employee's response was not helpful. The customer might not be in the wrong for leaving in frustration, but perhaps could have handled it more diplomatically. However, the main issue is the store's pricing error, not the customer's immediate reaction.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They were correcting a mistake and felt the employee wasn't cooperating, leading to their decision to leave. The employee's role in the confusion is significant here.\n"
