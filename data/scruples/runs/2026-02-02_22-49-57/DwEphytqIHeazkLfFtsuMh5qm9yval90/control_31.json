She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer left in frustration. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author asked for 1 pound of oven-roasted turkey at $3.98 per pound. The deli employee gave them 1.745 pounds but charged $6.98 per pound, which is more expensive. The customer pointed out the mistake, and the employee said the price had gone up but didn't update the sign. Then, when the customer noted the weight was over a pound, the employee questioned the weight and tried to fix it by taking the meat back, but the customer got so frustrated they left without saying anything.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is the asshole (A) or not (B). Let's consider the facts. The employee made a pricing error, but the customer is paying more than the listed price. The customer tried to correct the error, and the employee was defensive, asking where it said the weight was 1.745 lbs. The customer's patience broke, leading to them leaving.\n\nFrom the customer's perspective, they were being overcharged. Even if the employee mentioned the price had increased, the sign wasn't updated, so the listed price was still $3.98. The customer had a right to question the discrepancy. The employee's response was dismissive, which is unprofessional. The customer's frustration is understandable, but leaving without resolving the issue or speaking to a manager might be seen as not trying to resolve it properly. However, the customer was polite and tried to address it directly. The employee's actions were confusing and possibly incorrect, and the customer might have felt that continuing the interaction would be fruitless or stressful.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the employee made a mistake, but the customer had a valid reason to question it. The customer's reaction, while abrupt, was a result of the employee's uncooperative response. The customer isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to escalate the situation further. They handled it by pointing out the error and then, when the employee didn't handle it properly, left. It's possible they could have asked to speak to a manager, but that's not mandatory. The main point is that the customer's actions were a reaction to the employee's confusion and incorrect pricing. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
