She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a customer at a deli counter who ends up with an overpriced and over-weight meat that was supposed to be a pound.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1 pound of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745 pounds priced at $6.98/lb. The customer points out the mistake, and the employee claims the price increased but didn't update the sign. The employee then tries to fix it by taking out the meat, putting in less, but the customer gets frustrated and leaves without saying anything.\n\nSo, the customer's main issue is the incorrect pricing and weight. They tried to address it politely but the employee didn't handle it well. The employee's response that the price went up but the sign wasn't updated might be a store policy issue. The customer's reaction was to walk out, which seems extreme but maybe understandable given the employee's unhelpful behavior.\n\nThe question is whether the customer is in the wrong. The key points are: Did the customer have a right to be upset? They were charged more than the listed price. The employee made a mistake, but the customer's reaction was to leave. Usually, in such cases, the right thing to do is to escalate if the employee is unhelpful. However, the customer chose not to escalate and left, which could be seen as not trying to resolve the issue fully. But the employee's behavior (tearing meat, not properly addressing the weight) might have pushed them to that point.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong: The customer has a valid reason to be upset. The store made an error. The employee's handling was poor. The customer's reaction was to leave, which might be seen as abandoning the issue, but given the employee's resistance, maybe not entirely their fault. So, is the customer in the wrong? If the customer left without trying to speak to a manager, maybe they didn't follow up, but the employee's actions contributed. So, perhaps the customer isn't in the wrong, but the employee is. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the store made a mistake and the employee didn't handle it properly, leading the customer to walk out in frustration."
