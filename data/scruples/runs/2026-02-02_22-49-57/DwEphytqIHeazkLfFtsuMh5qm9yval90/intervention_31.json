She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused and without explaining. So, the situation is that the author asked for 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98 per pound. The girl said it might be a bit over, but when she gave him the meat, the price tag was $12.18 for 1.745lbs at $6.98. He pointed out the mistake, she said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then he mentioned it's over a pound, and she asked where it says that. She starts rebagging with fewer slices, and he just walks out.\n\nFirst, the author's request was specific: 1lb of turkey at a certain price. The deli employee didn't adhere to that and charged a higher price. The author is upset because he was overcharged and the meat was not as requested. He tried to politely point out the error, but the employee didn't correct it immediately. Instead, she took the meat back, but then only put a smaller amount, which he noticed was still not matching the weight on the tag. He's clearly frustrated, and instead of escalating or arguing, he left.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. From his side, he's a customer who was overcharged and given more than the requested amount. He tried to correct it, but the employee was dismissive. His reaction is to leave, which could be seen as abrupt, but given the situation, maybe it's understandable. The employee made a pricing error and didn't handle it well when confronted. The author's frustration is over being overcharged and not getting the service he expected. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, employees are expected to handle transactions correctly. If the price was indeed increased without updating the sign, that's a store error. The author's main issue is the weight and price discrepancy. He wasn't rude when he first pointed it out, but the employee's response was unhelpful. The author's decision to walk out might be seen as impolite, but given the employee's lack of cooperation, maybe it's a justified reaction to avoid further conflict. \n\nSo, the key points are: the employee made a mistake, the customer tried to address it, the employee didn't fix it properly, and the customer left. In this case, the store is at fault for the pricing error and the employee's handling. The author, while perhaps abrupt, was in a frustrating situation and might not be in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
