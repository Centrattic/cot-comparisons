She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a deli employee making a mistake with the pricing and weight of the turkey meat. The author initially asked for 1lb at $3.98, but was charged almost $12 for 1.745lbs. The employee tried to explain the price change and then tried to adjust the weight, but the author left without saying anything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The deli girl made a pricing error by charging the higher price without updating the sign. The author pointed out the mistake and tried to address it. The employee then took the meat back and started to rebag it, which the author found frustrating. The key point is whether the author overreacted by leaving abruptly without resolving the issue.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable given the situation. However, walking out without communicating further could be seen as rude, especially since the employee was attempting to correct the mistake. On the other hand, the employee's method of handling the issue\u2014tearing slices and adjusting the weight\u2014might have been unprofessional, contributing to the author's decision to leave.\n\nI need to determine if the author's actions were inappropriate. While the author had a valid reason to be upset, leaving without addressing it directly could be seen as avoiding the conflict. However, the employee's behavior might have justified the author's frustration. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for not following up or if the employee's handling of the situation was the primary issue.\n"
