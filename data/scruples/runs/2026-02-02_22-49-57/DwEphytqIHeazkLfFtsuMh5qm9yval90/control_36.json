She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is at a deli. The person asked for 1lb of turkey meat, which is priced at $3.98 per pound. The deli girl gives them 1.745lbs but charges $6.98 per pound, making the total around $12.18. The customer points out the mistake, and the employee says the price has gone up but didn't change the sign. Then the author gets into a back-and-forth, the employee starts cutting the meat into slices and trying to fix it, but the author just leaves without saying anything.\n\nFirst, let's break down the facts. The customer ordered a specific item with a price. The employee either mispriced the item or there was a sign error. The customer is paying more than the advertised price. The employee's response seems dismissive, which probably added to the frustration. The customer tried to communicate the issue, but the employee's actions (like cutting the meat into fewer slices) might not have resolved the problem correctly. The author then walks out, leaving the employee with the meat.\n\nNow, is the author at fault? Well, the main issue here is whether the customer handled the situation appropriately. The customer was polite initially, pointed out the mistake, and when the employee tried to fix it, the solution might not have been correct. The employee might have overcompensated by reducing the weight but still charging the higher price. The customer, feeling that their issue wasn't resolved and perhaps frustrated by the employee's handling, left abruptly. \n\nBut was that the right move? If the customer left without resolving the issue, maybe they should have asked to speak to a manager. However, the employee might have been in over their head, and the customer didn't want to escalate further. The customer's main goal was to buy groceries at the correct price. If the store was overcharging due to a sign error, the customer has the right to point that out. However, walking out without word could be seen as rude, especially leaving the employee with the meat. But given the employee's dismissive attitude, maybe the customer felt it was a lost cause. \n\nIn terms of the store's responsibility, if the sign is wrong, the customer can either pay the listed price or the correct price. If the employee is trying to charge more without updating the sign, that's the store's mistake. The customer is right to question that. But the employee's response and actions might have made the situation worse. The customer's frustration is understandable, and their reaction, while abrupt, might be a result of that frustration. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't confront the employee aggressively. They tried to resolve it, then left. Maybe they could have handled it better by talking to a manager, but the employee's behavior might have justified the customer's actions. The key point is whether the customer had a legitimate reason to be upset and if their response was proportionate. Since the store made a pricing error and the employee was unhelpful, the customer's actions might be seen as justified, even if abrupt. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
