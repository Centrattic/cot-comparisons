She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a deli employee who messed up the pricing and weight of the meat. The customer, the author, confronted her, and after a tense exchange, left without finishing the transaction. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, the employee made a mistake. She charged the higher price ($6.98/lb) instead of the $3.98/lb the customer was told. The customer pointed this out politely. The employee then tried to justify it by saying the price had gone up but the sign wasn't updated. Then the customer pointed out the weight was over a pound more than requested. The employee then took the meat, took out slices, and tried to repackage it, but the customer was fed up and left.\n\nSo, the author's actions: they left without saying anything. The question is whether that's acceptable. The author was frustrated and didn't want to escalate by talking to a manager. They felt they couldn't deal with the employee's confusion or mistake. \n\nFrom a customer service perspective, the employee was at fault for the pricing error and miscalculating the weight. The customer tried to address the issue but the employee was dismissive or incorrect in her responses. The customer's frustration is understandable. Walking out might be seen as abrupt, but considering the employee's response, maybe the customer felt it was a lost cause. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were trying to resolve the issue but lost patience. The employee's actions were unprofessional. The author didn't escalate to a manager, but left. Some might say the author should have tried harder to resolve it, but others might agree that after the employee's confusing behavior, it was reasonable to leave. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because the employee made the mistake and the customer was within their right to leave if the resolution wasn't satisfactory. However, the author could have tried to contact the manager later, but in the moment, they chose to leave, which is a personal choice. The primary responsibility for the error was on the employee, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
