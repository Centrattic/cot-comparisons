She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for leaving the deli counter without saying a word after realizing they were overcharged.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the sequence of events. The author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of oven-roasted turkey meat at $3.98/lb, thinly sliced. The employee sliced it and said it might be a bit over, which the author agreed to. Then, when the author looked at the price tag, it was $12.18 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98/lb. The author told the employee they thought there was a mistake and pointed out the price discrepancy. The employee responded that the price had gone up but the sign wasn't updated. \n\nThe author then points out the weight is over a pound and a half. The employee takes the meat, starts rebagging it, and the author gets irritated. The employee puts 2 slices on the scale, tears another in half, and bags it. The author got annoyed, left the basket, and walked out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n\n1. The employee initially sliced the meat thinly, which might have made the weight appear more than a pound, but the author agreed to it being a bit over. However, the price tag ended up being higher both in weight and price per pound. The original price was $3.98/lb, but the final tag was $6.98/lb, which is a significant increase. \n\n2. The employee's response about the price change but not updating the sign might be a valid explanation for the higher price per pound. However, the weight was also over what was ordered. The author pointed out the weight, the employee tried to address it by rebagging, but the author left without completing the transaction.\n\n3. The author's actions: they tried to point out the mistake, were polite, but then when the employee rebagged and tried to fix it, the author left. The employee might be making a mistake in the process, or the author might feel that the situation is not being resolved properly.\n\nNow, considering the rules of \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA), the community often looks at whether the person acted unreasonably or inconsiderately. The author did try to politely point out the mistake, which is reasonable. The employee's explanation about the price change might be legitimate, but the original order was for $3.98/lb. If the price had indeed gone up to $6.98/lb, then the new price is correct. However, the employee might have made a mistake in the quantity. The author ordered 1lb but was given 1.745lbs, which is a 74% over. That's a lot. The employee tried to adjust by taking slices out, but maybe the author felt it was too late or not handled properly.\n\nThe employee's behavior: when the author said the weight is almost two pounds, the employee took the meat and asked where the weight was stated. This might be a mistake, but the author was pointing out the weight on the tag. Then the employee started rebagging, but only put 2 slices and half of another, which might not be accurate. The author got fed up and left.\n\nSo, the author's fault could be in walking out without resolving the issue, but the employee's actions might have been confusing. The author was polite and tried to address the problem, but when the employee didn't handle it satisfactorily, they left. In such situations, it's often considered acceptable to leave if the service is not up to par, especially if the customer feels disrespected or the employee isn't addressing the issue. The employee might have made a mistake in both the price and the weight, and the author's patience was lost, which is understandable. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They tried to handle it politely, but when the employee's response was unsatisfactory, they left. The employee's actions might have been the main issue here. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
