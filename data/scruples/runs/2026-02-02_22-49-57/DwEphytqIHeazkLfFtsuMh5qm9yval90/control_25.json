She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter incident where the customer left in frustration because the employee messed up the weight and price of the turkey meat. \n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1 pound of turkey at $3.98 per pound, but the employee gave them 1.745 pounds at $6.98 per pound. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee tried to explain the price increase and the weight being over a pound. Then the employee took back the meat, but instead of just adjusting the weight, she took out most of it, put two slices, tore another, and tried to repackage. The customer then walked out without saying anything.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is the asshole. Let me break it down. The customer was polite when pointing out the error, which is reasonable. The employee's initial response was to blame the sign not being updated, which could be a problem. Then when the customer mentioned the weight, the employee started repackaging but didn't correct the weight correctly. The customer lost patience and left. \n\nThe key points here: the author tried to address the error politely. The employee made mistakes, didn't correct the weight properly, and perhaps didn't handle the situation well. The customer's frustration is understandable, especially if the employee was dismissive or didn't fix the issue. Walking out without saying anything could be seen as rude, but if the customer felt their time was wasted and the employee wasn't cooperating, maybe it's not entirely their fault. \n\nBut the customer did walk out, leaving the employee confused. The employee might have been trying to fix the mistake, even if in a clumsy way. The customer could have clarified further or approached the manager. However, the customer mentioned they didn't want to be \"that guy\" asking to speak to the manager, so maybe they were trying to avoid a confrontation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the customer's action of leaving might be justified if they felt the employee wasn't addressing the issue correctly. But they could have been more polite in their exit. However, the main error was on the employee's side for incorrect pricing and weight. The customer's irritation is part of the situation, but the employee's handling of the problem contributed to the conflict. So the author isn't in the wrong entirely. The answer is probably B, No.\n"
