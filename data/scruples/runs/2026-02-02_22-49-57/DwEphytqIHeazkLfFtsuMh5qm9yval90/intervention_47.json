She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where there was a pricing error and the employee handled it poorly.\n\nFirst, I need to break down what happened. The author asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745lbs but charged at $6.98/lb, which is way over the price they were told. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee tried to justify the price increase, then when the weight was an issue, she started taking out the meat and measuring it. She put 2 slices and half another, totaling less than a pound but charged the higher rate. The customer got fed up and left without finishing the interaction.\n\nThe key points here are the employee's actions. The initial mistake was the price being higher than the sign, and then the weight was over. The customer tried to correct both issues. The employee then tried to repackage the meat in a way that was both underweight and overpriced. The customer couldn't handle this and left. \n\nNow, the question is whether the customer is at fault. The employee made errors, which is part of the problem. The customer tried to address the issues politely but became irritated when the employee was dismissive and tried to fix it by under-serving. The customer's frustration is understandable. Walking out might be seen as not following through, but considering the employee's behavior, the customer might have felt it was pointless to confront her further or escalate. \n\nIn terms of responsibility: the store made the pricing error, and the employee handled it poorly. The customer's reaction is a result of that. The customer isn't in the wrong for pointing out the mistake and becoming frustrated with the employee's response. Walking out is a personal choice, but given the circumstances, it's a reaction to the employee's incompetence, not a deliberate wrong. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
