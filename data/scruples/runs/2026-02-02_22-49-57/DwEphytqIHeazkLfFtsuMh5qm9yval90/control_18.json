She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer ends up with a different price and weight than expected.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745 lbs but charged $6.98/lb. The customer pointed out the mistake, and the employee mentioned the price had increased but didn't update the sign. Then the employee tried to adjust the weight by taking the meat back, but the customer got frustrated and left without saying a word.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the employee make a mistake with the price and weight? The customer was polite initially. The employee might have been trying to fix the issue, but the customer left in frustration. \n\nThe customer's main complaint is about the price discrepancy. The employee admitted the price had gone up but didn't correct the weight. The customer was given more weight than requested but charged a higher price per pound. The customer tried to point this out, but the employee didn't handle it well. \n\nThe customer's reaction was to leave without finishing the interaction. The question is whether that makes them the asshole. \n\nIf the employee was at fault for not correctly applying the new price and giving incorrect weight, then the customer isn't necessarily wrong for being upset. However, walking out without resolving it might be seen as rude. \n\nBut given that the customer was polite and the employee was unhelpful, the customer's frustration is understandable. The author might not be in the wrong here. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
