She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused and not saying anything. The situation is that the author bought meat, but the price was wrong. The deli staff member told them the price had gone up and the sign wasn't updated. Then, when the author pointed out the weight was more than a pound, the employee didn't acknowledge it properly and tried to fix the weight by taking out slices. The author got frustrated and left.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what each person did. The deli girl made a mistake in pricing and then in weighing. The author noticed both the price and the weight discrepancy. The employee said the price went up but didn't correct the weight. The author was polite initially but got irritated when the employee didn't address the weight issue. The employee then tried to fix it by taking out slices, but the author just walked out.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider the expectations of the customer and the employee's responsibility.\n\nThe employee made an error in pricing first. Then, when the customer pointed out the weight, the employee didn't seem to take the issue seriously. The author was trying to get the correct amount for the price they were quoted. The employee's response to the weight issue was to take out meat, but the author might have thought that the weight was being manipulated to charge more. The author's frustration is understandable because the employee didn't seem to address their concerns properly. Walking out might be seen as impolite, but the author was trying to avoid a confrontation. However, the deli girl was the one making the mistake, and the author was just seeking a correct transaction. The author's actions could be justified as self-preservation not wanting to escalate the situation. But maybe the author should have tried to resolve it instead of leaving. The key points are the employee's errors and the customer's attempt to correct them. The author isn't at fault for noticing the mistake and trying to resolve it. The deli girl is in the wrong for not being clear and making the customer handle it. So the answer is B (No).\n"
