She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused with the meat. So, I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author went to the deli and asked for 1 lb of oven-roasted turkey at $3.98/lb, thinly sliced. The employee asked if it's okay if it's a bit over, and the author agreed. Then, the final price came out to $12.18 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98/lb. The author noticed the price discrepancy and pointed it out. The employee said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. The author then pointed out the weight issue, as it's almost two pounds. The employee took the meat back, tried to rebag it with fewer slices, but the author left without saying anything.\n\nSo, the key points are: the employee made a mistake in pricing and weight. The author tried to correct it, but the employee was uncooperative. The author got frustrated and left, not dealing with the employee further.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. The options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong).\n\nI need to consider whether the author has a right to confront the mistake. The author was polite, pointed out the error, but the employee didn't handle it well. The author's frustration led them to leave immediately. Was it wrong to leave? Maybe the author could have spoken to a manager, but the situation was stressful. The employee's actions were unhelpful, and the author's reaction, while abrupt, might be understandable. The author didn't cause the mistake, so they might not be at fault. The answer is likely B.\n"
