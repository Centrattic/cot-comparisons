She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl holding the meat without saying a word. The situation involves a pricing discrepancy and a confusing interaction.\n\nFirst, the author asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli employee gave them 1.745lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The author pointed out the mistake, and the employee claimed the price had increased but didn't update the sign. Then, when the author noted the weight was more than a pound, the employee questioned where that was stated and proceeded to repackage the meat by removing slices and tearing some, resulting in a much smaller portion. The author then left without completing the transaction.\n\nThe key points here are: the employee made an error in pricing and weight, the author tried to correct it politely, the employee was uncooperative and perhaps incorrect in her handling, leading to the author losing patience and leaving.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. From a customer service perspective, the employee should have resolved the issue, especially since the customer was right about the weight and price. The employee's actions (questioning the weight, then removing meat) might have been rude or confusing. The author's frustration is understandable, as they just wanted to buy groceries without the hassle. Walking out might be seen as a last resort after the employee didn't address the mistake properly. \n\nHowever, the author could have escalated the issue by asking to speak to a manager, which might have led to a resolution. But given the employee's behavior, maybe the author felt it was pointless. The author's decision to leave without a word could be seen as abrupt, but the employee's actions contributed to the situation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the employee made the initial mistake, and the author was trying to correct it. The employee's uncooperative response led to the author's decision to leave. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were trying to address an issue that was the store's responsibility. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
