She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is the asshole for leaving the deli counter without resolving the pricing and weight issue. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author asked for 1lb of oven roasted turkey meat at $3.98 per pound. The deli worker gave them 1.745 lbs but charged $6.98 per pound, which is significantly more. The author pointed out the mistake, the worker tried to explain the price change, then the author got irritated because the weight was over a pound and the cost was wrong. The worker then took the meat back, tried to rebag it by using only a few slices and tearing one in half. The author left without saying anything.\n\nFrom a consumer perspective, the author is justified in noticing the error. The worker initially said the price was $3.98, but then charged $6.98. The weight was also more than requested, but the author was okay with that. However, the worker's response to rebagging by reducing the weight using partial slices might be confusing. The author's frustration is understandable because of the confusion and possible overcharging.\n\nBut the author walked out without resolving the issue. They didn't ask to speak to a manager or clarify further. The worker might have been trying to correct the mistake, even if in a clumsy way. The author's action of just leaving could be seen as abandoning the worker to handle the problem alone, especially if the worker was already stressed or confused. However, the author mentions they didn't want to be the guy causing a scene. \n\nOn the other hand, the worker made a mistake in pricing and perhaps in weight. The author was polite in pointing it out. The worker's response of not changing the sign yet is a common issue in stores, but the author's main issue was the discrepancy in weight and price. The worker then tried to correct it by taking out the meat and rebagging, but maybe didn't handle it smoothly. The author's irritation is valid, and walking out might be a way to avoid conflict. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They did point out the mistake, tried to resolve it, and when the worker tried to correct it but in a confusing manner (maybe not knowing how to correctly weigh it), the author left. It's possible the worker was making another mistake, but the author didn't give her a chance to correct it properly. However, the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the worker made an error in both price and weight. The author's action of leaving might be seen as avoiding the problem, but given the situation, maybe it's not their fault. The key points are that the author was polite, the worker was possibly confused, and the author didn't escalate the situation. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author had the right to be confused and frustrated, and walking out might be a way to cut their losses without further argument. The worker's mistake was the main issue, and the author's response, while abrupt, is understandable under the circumstances.\n"
