She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author went to a deli, asked for 1lb of oven-roasted turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee gave them 1.745lbs priced at $6.98 per pound. The author pointed out the mistake, the employee initially said the price increased but hadn't updated the sign. Then the author noticed the weight was over a pound, and the employee started taking the meat apart to rebag it. The author got frustrated and left without saying anything to the employee.\n\nSo, the key points here are the error in pricing and weight. The employee made a mistake, but maybe the author didn't handle it politely. The employee tried to fix the issue by rebagging, but the author lost patience. The author didn't confront the manager or ask for a refund, just left. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the employee was at fault for the pricing error and incorrect weight. The author tried to point it out but got irritated. The employee's actions (rebagging without explanation) might have been confusing. The author's reaction was to leave, which could be seen as rude, but considering the stress of the situation, maybe understandable. \n\nThe author didn't escalate to a manager, so maybe they could have handled it better. However, the employee's behavior was unprofessional. The author's mistake was not communicating further, but the main fault lies with the employee. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). The author was a customer, and the store made the error. The author's frustration is justified, and leaving wasn't the worst thing they could do. They didn't cause harm, just left when the situation wasn't resolved properly.\n"
