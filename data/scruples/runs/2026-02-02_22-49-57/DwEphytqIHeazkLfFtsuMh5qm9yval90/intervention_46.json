She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The situation involves a deli counter worker who seems to have made a mistake with the pricing and weight of the turkey meat.\n\nFirst, the author asked for 1lb of oven roasted turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli girl said it might be a bit over, which is normal because sometimes the weight can be slightly more. But when the author checked, the bag was 1.745lbs and priced at $6.98/lb. That's a significant jump in both weight and price. The author politely pointed out the mistake, but the employee was dismissive, even asking where it said that. Then the employee took the meat, which was sliced too thick, and tried to rebag it by putting 2 slices in, tearing another, and ending up with about 1.5lbs maybe? The author then just walked out, feeling frustrated.\n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether the author was wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The employee made an error in pricing, which is the store's fault. The author tried to address it politely but the employee was unhelpful. The author walked out instead of escalating to the manager. \n\nIs it reasonable to walk away in this situation? The author was polite, noticed the mistake, tried to correct it, and the employee didn't acknowledge it properly. The employee's behavior might have been confusing or unprofessional. The author might have felt that the employee wasn't taking their concern seriously. However, maybe the author could have been more patient and spoke to the manager to resolve it. But the author's main issue was the price discrepancy and the employee's response. If the employee was mistaken and the author didn't want to be confrontational, walking away could be seen as a way to avoid an argument. \n\nIn some cases, customers are expected to check their receipts and bring up discrepancies. The employee might have been new or making a mistake. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if they felt the employee was defensive or not helpful. However, the act of leaving without resolving the issue might be seen as abrupt. But given the employee's behavior, the author might not have wanted to engage further. \n\nThe key points are: The author tried to address the issue politely, the employee was unresponsive, and the author walked out. The author isn't wrong because the mistake was on the employee's side. They didn't lash out but just left. The employee's actions (defensive response, not properly correcting the weight) might have pushed the author to leave. So the answer is B.\n"
