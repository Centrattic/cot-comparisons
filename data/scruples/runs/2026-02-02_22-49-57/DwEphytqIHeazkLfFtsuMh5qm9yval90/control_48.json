She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a deli counter where the customer gets charged a higher price and a different weight than expected. The customer confronts the employee, who seems confused and maybe makes a mistake. The customer then just leaves without saying anything else.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the customer's actions. They asked for a pound of turkey at $3.98, but they were given 1.745 lbs at $6.98. The employee said the price had increased but didn't update the sign. The customer politely pointed out the discrepancy in weight and price. The employee then tried to repackage the meat by taking out some slices and weighing again. The customer became frustrated and walked out without further action.\n\nNow, the key points here are whether the customer handled the situation appropriately. The customer did try to address the issue politely, pointing out the mistake. The employee was uncooperative and possibly confused. The customer was irritated but tried to resolve it. Then, when the employee tried to repackage, the customer gave up and left. \n\nIs the customer wrong for leaving? Well, in such situations, it's common for people to get frustrated if they feel they're not being helped. The employee's actions might have been part of the problem\u2014maybe not knowing the correct prices or handling the situation poorly. The customer could have escalated by talking to a manager, but they chose to leave instead. \n\nIs that the wrong move? Well, maybe not. If the employee was being dismissive or unhelpful, the customer might feel there's no point in continuing. However, the customer could be in the wrong if they left without ensuring the issue was resolved, but the situation might have been too stressful or the employee too uncooperative. \n\nConsidering the details, the customer tried to address the problem, but the employee's confusion and actions (like tearing the meat) might have pushed the customer over. The customer's final action was to leave, which might be seen as not following up, but in the heat of the moment, it's understandable. The employee might have been at fault for the pricing error and not handling the customer's concern properly. So the customer isn't necessarily in the wrong; the situation might have been too trying. The answer might be B, No.\n"
