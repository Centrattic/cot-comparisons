She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without saying a word. The situation involves a price discrepancy and a weight issue.\n\nFirst, the author asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli employee gave them 1.745lbs but charged at $6.98/lb. The author noticed the mistake and pointed it out. The employee defended the higher price by saying the sign wasn't updated. Then the author got irritated when the employee didn't seem to acknowledge the weight being over a pound. The employee took the meat, put 2 slices and half another, totaling about 0.5lbs, but the author walked out instead of discussing it further.\n\nSo, the author's main points: the price was higher than the sign, and the weight was more than requested. The employee didn't correct the weight but instead tried to underweight the product. The author felt the employee was being dismissive and couldn't handle the situation, leading them to leave.\n\nFrom the employee's side, maybe she's new or made an error. She might have thought the price was changed but didn't update the sign, hence the confusion. However, when the customer pointed out the weight was over a pound, she didn't offer to fix it properly. Instead, she took the meat and reduced the amount, which might be a mistake. She might have been trying to correct the weight but miscalculated, or perhaps she was dishonest.\n\nThe author's reaction: they were polite initially but when the employee didn't seem to take their concerns seriously, they lost patience. Walking out without addressing the issue could be seen as not giving the employee a chance to correct it. However, the author might have felt that the employee was not being truthful or helpful, so leaving was a way to avoid confrontation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the employee might have made an error, but the author didn't clarify or ask to see the manager. By walking out, they might have left the employee hanging. But the author's frustration is understandable, especially if the employee was dismissive and tried to shortchange them. The key points are the price discrepancy and the weight issue. The author wasn't wrong in pointing out the mistake, but maybe in not following up. However, given the employee's response, the author's actions could be justified. The answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to get a fair price and the employee wasn't helpful. But I need to make sure. The author didn't steal; they tried to correct the mistake but got frustrated. So B.\n"
