She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit of a mess. The person went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee gave them 1.745lbs, but charged $6.98 per pound, which is way over the price they expected. The employee said the price had gone up but the sign wasn't updated. Then the employee tried to fix it by taking out the meat, but ended up putting in only 2 slices and half another, which sounds like way less than a pound.\n\nSo the author was confused and frustrated. The employee was making mistakes, maybe trying to correct them but not doing it properly. The author got annoyed and left without saying a word. The key points here are: was the author wrong to leave without addressing the issue? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the employee made a pricing error. The author pointed it out politely. The employee then tried to correct the weight, but ended up giving less than requested. The author was probably stressed or fed up with the situation. Leaving without speaking to a manager or clarifying might be seen as rude, but the employee's actions were confusing and possibly incorrect. \n\nThe author's main issue was just wanting to buy groceries without the hassle. The employee's actions might have been a mistake, but the author didn't escalate it, which some might see as reasonable. Others might say that the author should have tried to resolve it, even if they were frustrated. However, the employee was already handling the issue, albeit poorly, and the author felt they couldn't deal with the situation anymore. \n\nIn the \"Am I the Asshole?\" format, the user is often in the right because the other party's actions are the problem. The employee made errors, and the author's frustration is justified. So the answer is likely B (Not the Asshole). The author wasn't wrong for walking out after the employee's confusing actions. They didn't escalate it further, which might be seen as a positive. The employee was the one causing the confusion, so the author's reaction is understandable.\n"
