She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who left the deli without saying anything is in the wrong. So, the situation is: they asked for 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98 per pound, but the deli girl gave them 1.745 lbs priced at $6.98 per pound. The customer points out the mistake, the employee says the price increased but didn't change the sign. Then the customer is confused because they were told it might be a bit over, but the weight is way more. The employee starts rebagging, puts 2 slices and half another on the scale. The customer then just leaves without speaking to a manager or anything.\n\nHmm, the key points here. The customer was polite when pointing out the error. The employee claimed the price had gone up but didn't adjust the sign. But the customer was confused about the weight discrepancy. The employee then starts rebagging, but maybe not correctly? The customer lost patience and left. \n\nFirst, the employee might have made a mistake in the price or the weight. The customer was correct in noticing the weight was 1.745 lbs instead of 1lb. The employee's response about the price increase doesn't explain the weight being over a pound. Maybe the employee was trying to charge the higher price for the existing weight, but the customer was supposed to get only 1lb. \n\nSo, the customer's reaction: they were polite, but when the employee didn't resolve it, they left. Is that the wrong thing? Well, the employee was possibly incorrect in the price or the weight. If the price is now $6.98 per pound, and they gave 1.745 lbs, then the total should be around $12.18, which is what was on the tag. But the customer thought the price was supposed to be $3.98. So maybe the sign was wrong, leading to confusion. The customer is correct in pointing out the weight is wrong if they asked for 1lb. The employee may have overfilled the order. \n\nThe customer's frustration is understandable. They were trying to buy groceries, noticed a mistake, tried to correct it, but the employee didn't handle it properly. Rebagging with 2.5 slices might not add up to the correct weight. The customer left in irritation. \n\nIs it the customer's fault? They didn't escalate to the manager, but they did point out the mistake. The employee might have been uncooperative or incompetent. The customer's action was to leave, which could be seen as not trying to resolve the issue. But maybe the right thing was to leave because the employee wasn't helping. \n\nAlternatively, the customer could have gone to the manager. But the question is about being the asshole. The customer was polite, just didn't want to deal with the employee. So maybe not their fault. The employee made multiple mistakes, and the customer left because they couldn't handle the situation. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The customer tried to address the issue politely, and the employee's confusion or errors led to the problem. The customer didn't have to deal with it if they couldn't resolve it further. They weren't rude, just left when the employee wasn't clarifying. So the customer isn't the asshole here.\n"
