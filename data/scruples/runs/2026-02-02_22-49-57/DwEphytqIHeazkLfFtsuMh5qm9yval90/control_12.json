She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is the asshole for leaving the deli girl confused and without speaking after a pricing and weight discrepancy. \n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per lb. The deli employee provided 1.745lbs but charged $6.98 per lb, which is significantly higher. The customer points out the mistake, and the employee initially says the price increased but hasn't updated the sign. Then, when the customer mentions the weight being over a pound, the employee questions where it says that and starts to repackage the meat by cutting slices, which seems to be a way to reduce the weight back to 1lb.\n\nHere, the employee's actions are a bit confusing. If the price per pound went up to $6.98, then the weight being over a pound isn't an issue unless the customer is being charged for the extra weight. However, the employee's response about the price tag and the way they repackage might indicate a mistake in how they handled the request. The customer is correct in noticing the weight discrepancy and pointing out the price. \n\nThe key question is the customer's reaction. They became irritated, left the meat there, and walked out without resolving the issue or speaking to a manager. While the customer had a right to question the price and weight, their abrupt departure could be seen as inconsiderate. The employee might be new or confused, and the customer's actions left her in a difficult spot, possibly having to explain the situation later or deal with the leftover meat. \n\nHowever, the customer's frustration is understandable given the error in pricing and the employee's unclear actions. They didn't escalate the situation to a manager, which could have been a more appropriate step. But walking out entirely might be seen as a harsh reaction. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong: The customer isn't in the wrong for noticing the error and trying to correct it. But leaving the employee with the meat without communication could be considered rude. The employee might have made a mistake, but the customer's handling of it is questionable. The answer might lean towards the customer not being entirely in the wrong because they were dealing with a customer service issue, but their method of resolution was abrupt. However, the primary issue is the store's error, so the customer's actions in response, while impolite, are reacting to a problem they didn't create. \n\nBut according to the question, the focus is whether the author is in the wrong. The customer's decision to walk out without resolution could be seen as not taking responsibility for the situation. They left the employee in a tough spot. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong for not handling it more politely and leaving the employee with the problem. Alternatively, it's a B because the store made the mistake. \n\nHmm. The deli girl's response was unhelpful and possibly incorrect. The customer tried to resolve it, but the employee's behavior was confusing. The customer left because they were frustrated, but is that their fault? The question is about whether they are in the wrong. The store should have correct pricing signs, and the employee's actions were poor. The customer's decision to leave might be a reaction to bad customer service, but it's still impolite. So maybe A and B are both partially right, but the main issue is the store's fault. The answer likely is B, the author isn't in the wrong because the store made the mistake, but their exit was abrupt. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer should be B, as the store's error is the main issue, and the customer's reaction, while impolite, is understandable given the circumstances.\n"
