She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a customer at a deli who ended up with a much more expensive product than expected due to a pricing error. The customer left without saying a word, and the question is whether they were wrong for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The customer asked for a specific price per pound, but the deli employee charged a higher rate. The customer pointed out the mistake, but the employee was defensive and tried to correct it by taking out slices, but the customer lost patience and left. \n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the customer have a right to be upset? The employee made a pricing error, which is on the store. The customer tried to point it out politely but the employee was unhelpful. The customer then left in frustration. \n\nIs the customer in the wrong for leaving without resolving the issue? Well, the customer's main issue was the pricing mistake. They tried to address it but got a poor response. In such cases, customers have the right to question incorrect charges. However, walking out without trying to resolve it might be seen as not following up. But maybe the customer was just done dealing with the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the deli employee's actions were unprofessional. The customer's frustration is understandable. The customer didn't escalate the situation to a manager, which could have resolved it. But the customer might have felt it wasn't worth the hassle. \n\nSo, the customer isn't necessarily in the wrong because the error was the store's. They had the right to point it out. However, leaving without any resolution might be seen as not taking responsibility, but given the employee's unhelpful response, the customer's reaction is somewhat justified. \n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The mistake was the store's, and the customer's frustration is valid. They had the right to leave if they felt they couldn't handle the situation further.\n"
