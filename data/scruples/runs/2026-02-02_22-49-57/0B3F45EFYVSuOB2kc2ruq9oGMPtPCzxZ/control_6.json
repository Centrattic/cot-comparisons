She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a child where the wife is from a Muslim immigrant family, and the husband is an atheist. They had agreed to raise their children secularly. The wife's father has taken their son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge and dressed him in Muslim clothes. The husband is threatening divorce if the wife continues to allow this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had a mutual agreement on secular upbringing. The wife's family is pressuring her, and the father-in-law is acting against the husband's wishes, which leads to the husband's ultimatum.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that he's standing up for his values and the agreement they made. He's concerned about his son being exposed to religion without consent. On the other hand, the wife might feel pressured by her family, but she's an adult and perhaps isn't taking the husband's concerns seriously enough. The father-in-law's actions are problematic because he's not respecting the husband's parental rights.\n\nLegally, in many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their child. If the husband is not Muslim and didn't consent, the father-in-law's actions could be considered overstepping. The husband's threat of divorce is based on the breach of their agreement. However, in a relationship, communication is key. The husband might have escalated the situation too quickly without resolving it through discussion with his wife first. But given that the father-in-law is involved, and the wife isn't preventing it despite agreeing to the secular upbringing, the husband's stance could be seen as justified.\n\nThe wife's actions might be influenced by her family's pressure, but she's responsible for honoring the agreement she made with her husband. The father-in-law's interference is a red flag, and the husband is protecting his son's upbringing. While the approach of threatening divorce is extreme, the core issue is about conflicting values and the husband asserting his right to co-parent. It's a complex situation, but considering the circumstances, the husband is defending their prior agreement and his parental rights. So, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong), but it's nuanced. However, based on the information given, the husband's actions are a response to a breach of their agreement and external interference, so the answer is B.\n"
