She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author is an atheist, married to a wife from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their children secularly, but the wife's father started taking their son to the mosque without consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and wife had an agreement about secular upbringing. The father-in-law is pressuring them, and the author is threatening divorce to prevent the son from being raised Muslim. The wife might be struggling between her family's expectations and her own agreement with the husband.\n\nThe author's stance is about protecting his son's upbringing, which he believes is a fundamental right. The wife's family's actions are going against the agreed-upon parenting plan. The father-in-law's interference without consent is problematic. The author feels that the family doesn't accept him, which adds to the tension.\n\nBut I should also think about the wife's perspective. She might feel caught between her husband and her family. The author's threat of divorce is a strong move. While the father has rights, is it reasonable to end the marriage over this? Divorce is a major consequence. However, the father is asserting his right to co-parenting decisions, which is valid. There's also the aspect of the father-in-law's actions being non-consensual, which is a breach of trust.\n\nIn family law, both parents usually have a say in their child's upbringing. The author is trying to enforce his part of the agreement. The wife's actions in allowing her father to take the child might be seen as a breach, too. But the author's response of threatening divorce might be seen as extreme, even if the issue is significant. However, if the father truly believes that the child's upbringing is a non-negotiable issue, his stance is defensible.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author is not in the wrong. The father has the right to be involved in his child's upbringing and to enforce the agreed parenting plan. The in-laws' interference without consent is the problem here. The author's actions are about protecting his child's future, which is a valid parental right. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
