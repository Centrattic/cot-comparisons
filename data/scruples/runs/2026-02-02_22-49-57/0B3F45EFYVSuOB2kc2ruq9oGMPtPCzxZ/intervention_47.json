She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with differing religious beliefs about raising their child. The husband is an atheist, and the wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their child secularly, but the wife's father is pressuring them, and the husband found out the father took the baby to the mosque without permission. The husband is considering divorce if the wife continues to comply with her family's wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement before having children, which the husband considered important enough that he wouldn't have kids otherwise. The wife's family is heavily involved, despite their dislike for the husband. The in-law is going behind the husband's back to expose the child to their religion, which the husband strongly opposes. The husband feels his wishes are being ignored, and he's stating that he can't allow the child to be raised in that religion, even if it means splitting up.\n\nNow, I need to assess whether the husband is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, in many places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their child's upbringing, but there are laws against certain practices, especially if they're seen as harmful. However, the situation here is about differing religious upbringing. The wife might feel caught between her family and her husband. The husband is standing by his original agreement, which the wife initially agreed to. The father-in-law's actions are a breach of that agreement, and the husband is reacting to protect his child's upbringing as per their prior understanding.\n\nHowever, the wife's actions might be influenced by her family's pressure. The husband is firm, but is it fair? The wife is an adult and can make her own choices, but the husband is also asserting his role as a parent. The key issue is the breach of trust and the initial agreement. The father-in-law's actions are a problem, but the wife's continued compliance might be the trigger for the husband's ultimatum.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the husband is not in the wrong for setting boundaries based on the prior agreement. The in-law's interference is problematic, and the husband is trying to protect his child's secular upbringing. The wife is in a difficult position, but the husband's stance is about honoring their mutual agreement and parental rights. Therefore, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
