She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is an atheist, and his wife was previously agnostic. They agreed to raise their kids secular. The wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family, and her father has taken the baby to the mosque without the author's knowledge. The author feels that his father-in-law is exerting control over the child and the wife, and he's threatening divorce if she continues this behavior.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's trying to protect his son from being raised in a religion he disagrees with. But he's also making a threat of divorce, which is a serious decision. The wife might feel trapped between her husband and her family. The father-in-law's actions are problematic, but the husband's response could be seen as extreme. The wife's autonomy is a factor too\u2014she's an adult, and maybe she's conflicted about this. If the author is not respecting her choices once they're made, that's an issue. But if she's not honoring their initial agreement, that's another angle. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to his beliefs and wants his son to be raised secular. On the other hand, threatening divorce over a disagreement might be harsh. The key points are mutual respect, the child's upbringing, and the wife's role in this. If the wife is willingly participating in her father's actions, maybe the author is right to be concerned. But if she's being pressured and the author is using divorce as a leverage, that could be where he's wrong. It's a complex situation with valid points on both sides. However, the author's ultimatum seems extreme, so maybe he's not wrong entirely. But threatening divorce is a heavy move. I think the answer leans towards the author not being wrong because he's standing up for his beliefs and the child's upbringing, but the method could be questioned. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's asserting his rights as a father, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
