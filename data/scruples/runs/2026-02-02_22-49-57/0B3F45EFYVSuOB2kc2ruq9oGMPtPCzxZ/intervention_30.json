She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over the religious upbringing of their son. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist, and his wife was initially agnostic but is from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their kids secularly. Now, the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without their knowledge. The author feels that the father-in-law is exerting too much control and is pressuring his wife, which is causing her emotional distress. The author is firm about not wanting the son raised in a strict Muslim environment, even if it means divorce.\n\nSo, the key points here are: mutual agreement before marriage, the father-in-law's interference despite the agreement, the wife's mental health, and the author's stance on his son's upbringing.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, both parents have rights in their child's upbringing. However, in many places, both parents have equal say unless a court decides otherwise. The author is enforcing his boundaries, which is understandable. However, threatening divorce over this could be seen as extreme. But considering the wife's family is pressuring her, and the father-in-law is acting against the parents' agreement, the author might feel he has no choice.\n\nThe wife's mental health is also a factor. She's happy at home but depressed around her father. The author is trying to protect his wife from her toxic family. However, by threatening divorce, he's putting the burden on the wife, which might not be fair if she's also a victim of her family's control.\n\nBut wait, the author says he's told her multiple times to stop the father from seeing the child, yet it keeps happening. This shows a pattern of the father-in-law not respecting the author's wishes. The author is trying to protect his child's upbringing and his wife's well-being. However, the ultimatum of divorce might be harsh. Maybe there are other solutions first, like mediation or legal steps.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's actions in allowing her father to take the child without consent could be a breach of trust. But if she's under pressure from her family, maybe she's not acting freely. The author might be right in standing his ground on the child's upbringing, which is a parent's right. However, the approach of threatening divorce might be too extreme, especially if the wife is still trying to maintain some connection with her family.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a tough call. The author's rights as a parent are important, but so is the wife's autonomy. If the wife is complicit in allowing her father to influence the child, that complicates things. However, if the wife is being coerced, the author's stance to protect his family's interests is justified.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he's defending his family's values and the child's upbringing, which is a valid concern. But the method of threatening divorce might not be the best approach. However, given the circumstances, his position could be seen as reasonable. So I'm leaning towards B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
