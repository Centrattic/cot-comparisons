She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening divorce over his wife's religious upbringing of their son. The author is an atheist, married to a wife from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed on raising their children secularly, but the wife's father is influencing the son against the author's wishes. The author found out the father took the son to the mosque without permission and is threatening divorce if the wife continues to allow this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have equal say in their child's upbringing unless a court decides otherwise. The author is asserting his right to prevent religious indoctrination, which he didn't agree to. However, the wife might feel her cultural and familial ties are important, especially if her family is pressuring her. The father-in-law's actions are unauthorized, which complicates things. The author has a right to protect his son's upbringing as per their agreement, but the method of addressing the issue\u2014threatening divorce\u2014might be seen as extreme. \n\nThe wife might be caught between her husband and her family, which could be causing her distress. The author's stance is about respecting their prior agreement, but the wife might feel she's being forced to choose between her husband and her family. The key points are the initial agreement, the unauthorized actions of the father-in-law, and the author's response. \n\nLegally, the father's right to make decisions about his child's upbringing is important. Ethically, the author is trying to uphold their mutual agreement, but the threat of divorce over this issue could be seen as harsh. However, given the father-in-law's interference without consent, the author's concern is valid. The wife's role in allowing this might also be a factor. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's motivations are understandable, threatening divorce is a significant step. However, given the unauthorized actions of the father-in-law and the prior agreement, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), but it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points. The final determination hinges on the context of their agreement and the father-in-law's overreach.\n"
