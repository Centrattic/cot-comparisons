She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for threatening divorce over his wife's religious upbringing of their son. The situation involves a lot of cultural and religious tensions.\n\nFirst, the husband is an atheist, and they had agreed to raise their children secularly. The wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family. The father-in-law took the son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge, which violates their prior agreement.\n\nThe husband feels that his rights as a father are being ignored. He's concerned about his son's upbringing and the influence of his wife's family. He's threatening divorce if the situation continues. \n\nOn one hand, the wife might feel caught between her family's expectations and her marriage. But the husband's stance is about protecting his son's upbringing as per their agreement. The father-in-law's actions are a direct breach of that agreement. The husband's reaction is based on the agreement they had and his right as a parent to have a say in their child's upbringing.\n\nThe wife's happiness at home versus the pressure from her family is a factor. The husband is trying to maintain the environment they both agreed upon. The key point is that both parents are supposed to make joint decisions, and the father-in-law shouldn't override the husband's wishes without consent.\n\nThe husband's threat of divorce is a strong measure, but it's in response to a breach of their mutual agreement and the violation of his parental rights. The father-in-law's actions are problematic, and the husband is standing up for his beliefs and the agreed parenting plan.\n\nSo, considering the agreement, the violation by the father-in-law, and the husband's right to be involved in his child's upbringing, the author might not be in the wrong. But there's also the aspect of the wife's autonomy. However, the father-in-law's actions are against the agreed terms, and the husband is defending that agreement. The wife's continued involvement in allowing her father to influence their son could be a point of contention, but the husband's stance is based on prior mutual agreement.\n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards B (No), the author is not in the wrong. However, the situation is complex. The husband's approach might be seen as extreme, but the circumstances involve a breach of trust and parental agreement. It's a matter of differing values and the enforcement of agreed-upon parenting choices.\n"
