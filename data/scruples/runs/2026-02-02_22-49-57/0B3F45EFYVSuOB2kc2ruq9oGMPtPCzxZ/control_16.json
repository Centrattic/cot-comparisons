She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (author) is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over their son's religious upbringing. The author is an atheist, the wife is from a Muslim immigrant family. They had agreed to raise their kids secularly, but the wife's father took the son to the mosque without the author's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple had an agreement pre-kids about secular upbringing. The wife's family isn't fond of the author, and her father is pressuring them. The author found out the father took their son to the mosque, which the author considers against their agreement. He then threatens divorce if this continues.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, in many places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their child's upbringing. However, the wife is the one actually acting on her family's wishes, possibly against the author's consent. But the author is taking a strong stance, which could be seen as controlling if he uses the threat of divorce to enforce his views.\n\nMarriage involves mutual respect. The author might feel his boundaries are violated, but the wife's actions might stem from her own family pressures. The author's decision to threaten divorce could be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is an adult making her own choices. However, the father's concern about his son's upbringing is valid. The line is where personal beliefs meet the child's welfare.\n\nIn some cultures, religious upbringing is a significant matter. The author's refusal to allow any Muslim influence might conflict with the wife's family's expectations. However, the wife's autonomy is a factor here. If she's making decisions for her son without the author's consent, that's a problem, but the author's response to threaten divorce might be harsh.\n\nAlso, the father-in-law's actions are unilateral, which the author rightly objects to. The wife might be in a dilemma between her husband and her family. The author's stance is about protecting his son's upbringing, but the method of using divorce as a threat could be seen as extreme. However, in a marriage where there's a fundamental disagreement on such a key issue, the author might not be in the wrong if the wife isn't respecting their prior agreement.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions might be justified as protecting his views, but the threat of divorce is a serious measure. However, since the wife is the one enabling the father's actions, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), but there are nuances. Alternatively, maybe A (Yes) if the threat is seen as overreaction. But given the prior agreement and the father-in-law's interference, the author's stance is about upholding their agreement, so B.\n"
