She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim. \n\nFirst, the background: The wife and husband are married for two years. The wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family, and the husband is an atheist. They agreed to raise their children secularly. The wife's family doesn't like the husband because he's white and from a Christian background. Now, the wife's father took their son to a mosque without the husband's consent, despite their agreement.\n\nThe husband is upset because he believes the father-in-law is exerting control over his wife and the child's upbringing. He's standing by his decision to not let religion be imposed on his son and is threatening divorce if the wife continues. The key points here are the breach of their agreement, the father-in-law's actions against the husband's wishes, and the wife's role in allowing or continuing this.\n\nNow, considering legality and ethics. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children, but if there's a conflict in religious upbringing, the child's best interest is a priority. However, the husband here is making a life-threatening decision (divorce) based on the wife's actions, which might be seen as extreme. The wife's actions might be influenced by family pressure, which complicates her responsibility. However, the father-in-law's unauthorized actions with the child could be a legal issue, as he's not the parent. \n\nThe husband's stance is about respecting their prior agreement. But threatening divorce over this could be seen as harsh, especially if the wife is under pressure. However, the father-in-law's actions are also problematic. The husband has a right to protect his child's upbringing, but the method of enforcing that through divorce might not be the only solution. The wife's compliance with her father's actions despite her initial agreement with the husband is a factor here. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the wife is an adult and should be able to make her own decisions, but the father-in-law's actions are a breach of the father's rights. The husband's reaction is about protecting his child's upbringing, but the ultimatum could be seen as extreme. However, given the context of the father-in-law's interference and the wife's possible submission to her family's pressure, the husband has valid concerns. \n\nLegally, the father-in-law's actions might be considered harmful interference by a third party, which could be a basis for legal action. The husband's threat to divorce is his personal choice, but it's a drastic measure. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for standing by his decision. Considering all factors, the answer might lean towards B (he's not in the wrong), as he's upholding their agreed-upon parenting plan and protecting his son from unwanted religious influence. However, the approach could be seen as extreme. But given the father-in-law's actions, the husband's position is defensible.\n"
