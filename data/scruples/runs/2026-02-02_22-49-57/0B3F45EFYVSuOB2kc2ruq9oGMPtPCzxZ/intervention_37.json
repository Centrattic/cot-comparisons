She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim.\n\nFirst, the man and his wife agreed to raise their children secularly. The wife is from a fundamentalist Muslim family, and the husband is an atheist. They were clear on their agreement. Now, the father-in-law has taken the son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge, which violates their agreement. The husband feels that his son is being exposed to religious practices against his wishes. He's also concerned about his wife's mental health, as she becomes depressed after visiting her father. He's trying to protect both his son and his wife from the father-in-law's influence.\n\nThe key points here are the agreed-upon parenting plan, the violation of that agreement by the father-in-law, and the husband's stance on protecting his child's upbringing. The husband is taking a firm stand to enforce the original agreement, which the wife agreed to. However, the wife might feel trapped between her husband and her family, especially if she's still practicing some form of Islam or under pressure. The husband's threat of divorce is a strong move, but given the violation of their agreement and the potential long-term impact on their son, it's about enforcing their shared decision.\n\nBut is the husband in the wrong? Well, the father-in-law's actions are the main issue here. The husband is reacting to an ongoing problem where his wishes are being disregarded despite his warnings. While the husband's approach is confrontational, it's in response to a breach of trust and the potential infringement on parental rights. The wife's continued cooperation with her father might be a point of contention, but the husband's primary issue is with the father-in-law's actions affecting their son. \n\nConsidering all this, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to protect his child's upbringing as agreed. However, the situation is complex, and communication between the couple might be necessary to address the wife's feelings and ensure they both are on the same page moving forward. But in terms of the immediate action of threatening divorce to stop unwanted religious influence, the husband's stance seems justified.\n"
