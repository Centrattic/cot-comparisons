She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user says the author is not, but I need to consider both sides. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author is an atheist, his wife was initially agnostic but now seems to be leaning into Islam for their son. They had an agreement that the child would be raised secular, but the wife's father has taken the son to the mosque without the author's knowledge. The author is threatening divorce if she continues this, feeling that the father-in-law is controlling his wife and the child against his wishes.\n\nSo, the key points here are the parents' agreement on raising their son secularly, the wife's actions (whether she's following through with the father's influence), and the father-in-law's behavior. The author has clearly expressed his stance multiple times, but the wife is still allowing her father to interact with the child in a religious context. The father-in-law is ignoring the author's requests and treating him as not the father. \n\nLegal and ethical aspects of child-rearing: Both parents have a say in their child's upbringing. If the author is a legal parent, he has the right to object to religious indoctrination without his consent. However, in many places, both parents can agree on religious upbringing, but if one is against it, there might be disputes. The wife's role is crucial here because she is the one who's the bridge between the father-in-law and the child. If she's allowing her father to do this, is she in violation of their agreement?\n\nThe author mentions that the wife is happy with their secular lifestyle but becomes depressed and ashamed after seeing her father. This suggests that her family's influence is causing her stress. The father-in-law's actions could be seen as undermining the couple's agreement and the author's parental rights. The author is standing by his initial agreement and feels the need to protect his son from unwanted religious influence. \n\nIs the author wrong for threatening divorce? Well, he's asserting his right to raise the child as he and his wife originally agreed. The wife, however, might be struggling with her family's pressure and her own beliefs. The author's response is extreme (divorce), but the issue is about the child's upbringing, which is a significant matter. \n\nBut wait, is it fair to hold the wife responsible for her father's actions? The author is upset with the wife for continuing to allow contact with her father who's pushing religion. However, if the wife is also being pressured by her family and might not have full control, maybe the blame isn't solely hers. Still, she is the mother and has a direct role in the child's life. \n\nThe author could be in the right in terms of protecting his son's upbringing as per their agreement, but the approach of divorce is a heavy consequence. The wife might feel torn between her family and her husband, and the father-in-law's actions are problematic. The author is standing up for his values and the agreement they had, which is understandable. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. If he's enforcing the original agreement and the wife is not adhering to it, maybe he's acting within his rights. \n\nBut does threatening divorce over this issue make him at fault? It might depend on the context of their relationship and whether there's been other issues. The author is clear about his stance, which he's communicated multiple times, and the wife's family is ignoring his input. The author is asserting his role as a parent, which is important. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be under duress from her family and could be feeling trapped. The author's ultimatum might not address the root cause of her compliance but instead punish her for the family's actions. That could be seen as unfair, especially if she's not the one directly causing the issue but is being pressured. \n\nBut the wife agreed to the secular upbringing, so if she's allowing her father to do religious things with the child, maybe she's in the wrong. The author is holding her accountable for that, as she's the parent. The father-in-law's actions are the real problem, but the author is directing his anger at the wife. Is that justified? \n\nIn terms of parental rights, both parents have a say. If the father-in-law is influencing the child without the father's consent, that's a problem. The author is trying to prevent that, but the method of divorce might be extreme. However, if the wife is not respecting the agreement by allowing this, then the author's stance is valid. \n\nSo, the author's position is that the child should be raised secularly as per their agreement and the father-in-law's actions are a violation. He's not in the wrong for wanting to protect his son's upbringing. The wife might be in a difficult position, but the author's response is about enforcing the agreement they had. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
