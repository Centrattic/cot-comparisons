She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim, despite their prior agreement to raise the children secularly. The wife is from a fundamentalist Muslim immigrant family, and the author is an atheist. They had agreed that their kids would be secular. The father-in-law took their son to the mosque without permission, and the author is upset about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple had an agreement, and the wife agreed to a secular upbringing. The father-in-law's actions are a breach of that agreement. The author is standing by his original stance, which is understandable, especially since he's an atheist and doesn't want his child exposed to religion against his will. The wife is in a tough spot because of her family's influence. She seems to be unhappy when around her father and comes back depressed, which suggests she's being pressured. The author is concerned about his son's upbringing and is asserting his rights as a parent.\n\nBut then, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's enforcing the original agreement. If the wife is going back on their agreement because of her family's pressure, then he's justified in taking a firm stance. However, threatening divorce might be extreme. But given the circumstances, maybe he feels he has no choice. The father-in-law's actions are overstepping, and the author can't control that directly. So the author is trying to protect his child's upbringing and his family's autonomy. The wife might need to stand up to her family, but if she's not doing that, the author is taking responsibility for his son's upbringing. I think the author is not in the wrong here because he's upholding their agreement and protecting his child's future. The answer is B.\n"
