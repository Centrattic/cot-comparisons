She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband and wife with conflicting religious beliefs about raising their child. The husband is an atheist, the wife was agnostic but now seems to be leaning towards Islam due to her family's influence. The husband is upset because the wife's father took their son to a mosque and dressed him in Muslim clothes without consent, despite prior agreement to raise the child secularly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple agreed before having kids that the children would be raised secularly. The husband's main issue is that the wife's family, particularly the father-in-law, is pressuring the wife and directly intervening with the child's upbringing against the husband's wishes. The husband feels that even though the wife is an adult and can make her own choices, the father-in-law is overstepping, especially with the child. The husband's ultimatum is that if the wife continues to allow this, he will divorce her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user wants an answer of A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nLooking at the situation, the husband is standing by his initial agreement about secular upbringing. The wife's actions, as described, involve her father taking the child without permission, which breaches the husband's trust. The husband is asserting his parental rights to decide the child's upbringing. However, it's possible that the wife might feel pressured by her family and is trying to navigate her loyalty to both her husband and her family. But the husband's main issue is the unauthorized contact with the father-in-law and the religious influence on the child.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, both parents have equal rights in child-rearing decisions, so the husband has a valid point in not wanting religious instruction without his consent. However, the wife's actions in allowing her father to take the child could be seen as undermining the husband's wishes. On the other hand, the wife might be struggling with her own cultural identity and family expectations. But the husband's stance is about protecting the child's upbringing as per their prior agreement. \n\nThe key here is that the wife's father acted without consent, which is a serious issue. The husband's response is to enforce the boundaries set in their agreement. While the wife's intentions might not be malicious, her actions (or inaction in preventing her father's actions) have consequences. The husband is not in the wrong for standing up for his beliefs and the agreed-upon parenting plan. However, the ultimatum of divorce is a strong measure, but given the circumstances, it's within his rights to prioritize his values regarding his child's upbringing. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
