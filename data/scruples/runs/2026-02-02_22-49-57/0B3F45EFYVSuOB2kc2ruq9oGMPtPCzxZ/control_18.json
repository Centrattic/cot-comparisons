She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening divorce over his wife's attempts to raise their son as Muslim, despite their prior agreement on a secular upbringing. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is an atheist, the wife was previously agnostic. They agreed on secular upbringing for any kids. The father-in-law, who is a fundamentalist Muslim, is pressuring the wife to raise the child as Muslim, even circumventing the author's wishes by taking the son to the mosque without permission. The author feels this violates their agreement and is considering divorce.\n\nNow, the main issue is parental rights and religious upbringing. The author believes that the child should be raised secular, and the wife's actions, influenced by her family, are going against that. The father-in-law's actions are a problem because he's taking the son without consent, which is a breach of trust. The wife might feel torn between her family's expectations and her previous agreement with her husband.\n\nThe author's threat of divorce is a serious step, but it's in response to what he perceives as a violation of their agreement. However, it's important to note that the wife might not have full control over her family's actions. The question is whether the author is justified in this stance.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, both parents have equal rights, but since the child is theirs, the author has a right to object to religious upbringing against his will. However, the wife's actions in allowing or not preventing her father from taking the child might be a point of contention. The author's ultimatum might be seen as extreme, but given the circumstances, it's a matter of personal values and how strongly one upholds the initial agreement.\n\nIt's also about communication. Did the author try all possible means to resolve this with his wife before threatening divorce? The wife might be under pressure from her family, and the author's approach could be seen as not considering her position. However, the father-in-law's direct violation of the author's wishes is a significant issue.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is standing by his values and the agreement made. But the method of resolving the conflict\u2014threatening divorce\u2014might be seen as harsh. However, given the importance of the child's upbringing, it's a personal decision. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions are proportionate. The wife's role here is also crucial; if she's complicit by not stopping her father, the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nLegally, in some places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their child's upbringing. If the mother is allowing or participating in the religious upbringing, it's a joint decision. But if she's against the author's wishes without his consent, it complicates things. The author's stance is about protecting his child's upbringing as per their agreement, which he's entitled to. The wife might need to take a firm stand against her family to honor her agreement with her husband. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the approach of threatening divorce is extreme. But given the situation, especially the father-in-law's actions, the author's concern is valid. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
