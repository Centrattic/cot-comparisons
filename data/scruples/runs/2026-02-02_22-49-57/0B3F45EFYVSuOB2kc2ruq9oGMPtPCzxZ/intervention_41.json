She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple with different religious views. The husband is an atheist, and the wife used to be agnostic but now seems to be leaning towards Islam, influenced by her fundamentalist family. They had agreed to raise their children secularly, but the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the husband's main point is that he doesn't want their son raised Muslim against his wishes. He feels that the father-in-law is pressuring his wife and influencing the child without his consent. He's given her chances to stop it, but she hasn't. So he's threatening divorce if she continues, which is a pretty serious move.\n\nNow, considering the rights of parents. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children. If one parent is making decisions that the other disagrees with, especially regarding religion, there might be legal considerations. But the problem here is that the husband is taking a hardline approach, threatening divorce. Is that justified?\n\nThe wife, on the other hand, might feel caught between her family's expectations and her marriage. She might be conflicted, especially if her family is pressuring her to conform. The husband is concerned about his son being exposed to religion without his consent, which is a valid parental concern. However, threatening divorce over this seems extreme. Maybe there are other ways to address the issue without splitting up, like legal steps or counseling.\n\nBut the father-in-law is directly violating the husband's wishes by taking the child without permission. That's a breach of trust and parental rights. The husband has the right to be involved in decisions about his child's upbringing. The wife's complicity in allowing this to happen, despite the agreement, could be a point of contention. However, the husband's response is to threaten divorce, which might not be the healthiest approach. Divorce is a major decision and using it as a threat might not resolve the underlying issues.\n\nAlso, the wife's mental health is mentioned; she's coming back depressed after seeing her father. That suggests she's under a lot of pressure from her family. The husband should consider her well-being too. Maybe there's a way to support her in standing up to her family without breaking up the marriage.\n\nIn terms of religious upbringing, it's a sensitive topic. Both parents have the right to their beliefs, but when it comes to children, there's usually a need for mutual agreement. If one parent is going behind the other's back, that's a problem. The husband's stance is about not allowing the father-in-law to influence the child against his wishes, which is understandable. But threatening divorce because of differing religious practices is a heavy-handed approach.\n\nSo, looking at all angles: the husband's rights as a parent are being violated by the father-in-law's actions, and his concern is valid. However, threatening divorce over this might not be the best solution. There might be other legal or emotional strategies to address the issue. The wife's role in this is also a factor\u2014she's part of the agreement but isn't stopping her family's influence. The situation is complex, but the husband's intent is to protect his child's upbringing as per their agreement. The wrong here might not be on the husband's side, as he's standing up for what he believes is right for their family. But his method is extreme. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's asserting his rights as a parent and the other party is violating an agreement, he might be justified in his stance, even if the threat of divorce is harsh. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
