She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist, and his wife was initially agnostic. They agreed that their children would be raised secular. Now, the wife's family, who are fundamentalist Muslims, is pressuring her, and despite the author's objections, the father-in-law took their son to the mosque without permission. The author is upset because he doesn't want his son raised Muslim against his wishes, even if it means splitting up.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the pre-existing agreement about raising the child secularly and the breach of that agreement by the wife's family. The author feels his boundaries are being crossed. The wife, however, might be under pressure from her family and possibly feels torn between her husband and her heritage.\n\nBut wait, the wife agreed to the secular upbringing initially, yet she's allowing her father to influence their son. The author feels betrayed that his wishes are being ignored. However, is it fair for him to threaten divorce over this? Divorce is a significant step, so we need to consider both sides' perspectives.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to his beliefs and the right to raise his child according to his values. On the other hand, the wife might feel that her cultural heritage is important and that her family's influence is part of her identity. She might also feel that her husband is being too controlling if he's not allowing any religious exposure, even if it's minimal or optional.\n\nThe father-in-law's actions are problematic because he's taking the child without consent, which is a breach of trust. But the wife's role here is crucial. If she's aware of her father's actions and hasn't stopped him, is she complicit? Or is she being coerced by her family's pressure?\n\nThe author's main issue is that the child's upbringing is being influenced against his wishes. Legally, in many places, parents have the right to make decisions about their child's upbringing, but when there's a conflict between parents, it can lead to custody issues. However, this is a personal conflict, not a legal one yet.\n\nThe author's threat of divorce is a reaction to a perceived betrayal. But is threatening divorce the right response? It depends on whether there's a willingness to communicate and find a compromise. The author claims he's already told her multiple times, but she continues. Maybe there's a lack of communication or understanding on both sides.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" because he's standing up for his values and the agreed-upon parenting approach. However, the approach of using divorce as a threat might be seen as extreme. It's possible that there's a need for counseling or mediation to address the underlying issues rather than an ultimatum.\n\nThe wife's actions might also be influenced by her family dynamics and cultural expectations. She might feel caught between her husband's wishes and her family's expectations, leading to the situation where her father acts without her consent. It's possible she's struggling with her identity and autonomy in this situation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns about his son's upbringing, the method of addressing the issue by threatening divorce might not be the most constructive approach. However, given the context of broken agreements and external interference from the wife's family, the author's stance is understandable. The question is whether the threat is justified given the circumstances. Since the wife has agreed to secular upbringing but isn't following through, and the father-in-law is acting unilaterally, the author's position is not necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
