She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the husband is an atheist and the wife is from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their children secularly, but the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge. The husband threatens divorce if the wife continues this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement about secular upbringing. The wife's family is pressuring her, and she's struggling. The father-in-law is acting without the husband's consent. The husband feels that the son is being influenced against his wishes. The wife might be caught between her family and her husband.\n\nLegally, in many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children. If the father objects to religious upbringing, there might be legal grounds, but it's complicated. However, the wife is an adult and might have her own beliefs now. The husband is using divorce as a threat, which is a strong action. But he's standing up for his values and the agreement they had. However, threatening divorce over this might be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is also conflicted.\n\nEmotionally, the wife seems to be in a tough spot, torn between her family and her husband. The husband is concerned about his son's upbringing, which is valid. But threatening divorce because of her family's actions could be seen as overreacting, especially if the wife is trying to maintain her relationship with her family while respecting her husband's wishes.\n\nEthically, it's about respecting each other's boundaries. The husband's right to prevent unwanted religious influence on his child is important, but the approach of threatening divorce might not be the healthiest. It's possible that communication and finding a middle ground could be better solutions. However, if the wife is not honoring the agreement and the father-in-law is disregarding the husband's wishes, the husband's stance is understandable.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer is probably B (the husband is not in the wrong) because he's upholding the agreement they made and protecting his child's upbringing. However, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening divorce\u2014might be seen as harsh, but the core issue of opposing unwanted religious influence is valid. The wife's role in allowing her father to act without the husband's consent is also a factor here.\n"
