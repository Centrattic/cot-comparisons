She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user says he's an atheist, his wife was agnostic when they got married, and they agreed to raise their kids secular. But now she's letting her father take their son to the mosque without his knowledge. He's threatening divorce if she continues. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have equal say in their child's upbringing unless a court decides otherwise. The author is asserting his right to not have his son raised in a certain religion against his wishes. But his wife is also a parent, so she might have her own views. However, the father-in-law is involved without permission, which complicates things. \n\nThe wife might be under pressure from her family, especially if they disapprove of her husband. She might feel torn between her spouse and her family. The author is frustrated because his wife isn't standing up to her father, even though they had an agreement. \n\nIs threatening divorce over this an overreaction? The author is standing by his original agreement. If the wife is going behind his back, that could be a breach of trust. But maybe he should have addressed it earlier or tried other methods first. However, the father-in-law's actions are also problematic, doing things without the other parent's consent. \n\nIn terms of ethics, parents have a right to raise their children, but both must agree. If one parent is undermining the other's wishes, that's a conflict. The author's stance is about protecting his child's upbringing as per their prior agreement. The wife's actions might be seen as not respecting that agreement, especially if she's enabling her father's influence. \n\nThe key point is whether the author is justified in using divorce as a threat. If he's not the one forcing the religious upbringing, but is trying to stop it, maybe he's not wrong. However, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening divorce without trying to resolve it through communication or mediation\u2014could be seen as extreme. But given the circumstances, maybe he's within his rights. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he's standing up for his beliefs and the agreement he had with his wife. The father-in-law's actions are the main issue here, and the wife might be complicit by not stopping him. The author is protecting his child's future, which is a valid reason. So the answer is B.\n"
