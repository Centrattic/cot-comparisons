She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a couple with a new baby, where the husband is an atheist and the wife is from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their children secularly, but now the wife's father is taking the baby to the mosque without the husband's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband and wife had an agreement before having kids about secular upbringing. The father-in-law is exerting influence, which the husband objects to. The husband is threatening divorce if the wife continues to let her father influence their son. The wife might feel pressure from her family, but she's an adult and the husband is asserting his rights as a parent.\n\nPossible angles: Parental rights vs. religious freedom. The husband is standing by the agreement they made, protecting his son from religion he doesn't agree with. However, the wife might feel torn between her family and her husband. The father-in-law's actions could be seen as overstepping, but the wife might be complicit if she's allowing it.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, parents have equal rights, so the husband has a right to be involved in the child's upbringing. However, the wife might have her own beliefs now. The husband's ultimatum could be seen as extreme, but he's defending his agreed-upon terms. Is threatening divorce over this issue justified? It depends on the circumstances. The father-in-law's actions are problematic, but the wife's role is key here. If she's actively enabling the father's involvement despite the agreement, the husband has a point.\n\nThe wife might be in a difficult position, but the husband is asserting his boundaries. The question is whether his response is too harsh. If the wife isn't respecting the agreement, the husband has a right to be upset. However, threatening divorce might be seen as taking it too far, especially if there's a way to resolve it without splitting. But given the context of the father-in-law's interference and the previous agreement, maybe the husband is justified.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer would lean towards the husband not being in the wrong (B). The main issue is the breach of their agreement and the father-in-law's unauthorized actions. The husband is trying to protect his son's upbringing as per their initial agreement.\n"
