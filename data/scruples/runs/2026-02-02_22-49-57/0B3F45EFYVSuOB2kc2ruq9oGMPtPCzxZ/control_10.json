She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is an atheist, married to a woman from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed that their children would be raised secular. The wife's family doesn't like the author because he's white and from a Christian background. After their son is born, the father-in-law takes the baby to the mosque without permission, dressed in Muslim clothes. The author is upset and threatens divorce if the wife continues to allow this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement about their children's upbringing. The author feels betrayed when the father-in-law intervenes without consent. The wife seems to be torn between her family's expectations and her own previous agreement. The author is taking a firm stance to protect what he believes is right for his son.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main issues here are the rights of parents in raising their child, the enforcement of prior agreements, and the handling of family interference. The author is standing by the initial agreement, which the wife had agreed to. However, the wife might be under pressure from her family, perhaps more than she anticipated. The father-in-law's actions are unauthorized, which is a problem because both parents have a say in their child's upbringing.\n\nThe author's threat of divorce if the situation continues is a serious matter. Divorce is a major step, so the question is whether that's a justified response. The author is prioritizing his secular upbringing for his son over his wife's possible return to her religion. The wife's autonomy is also a factor here; she might be struggling between her husband's wishes and her family's influence.\n\nIn family law, both parents have equal rights to make decisions for their children unless there's a court order stating otherwise. The father-in-law's involvement without consent could be problematic, as it's the parents' responsibility. The author is trying to prevent external influence, which is understandable. However, the approach of threatening divorce might be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is trying to navigate between two cultures and expectations. There might be room for compromise or finding a middle ground where the child is exposed to the religion but not forced into it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to be involved in his child's upbringing and to object to religious instruction against his will. If the wife continues to allow her family to override his wishes, it could be a breach of their agreement. The key point is whether the author is enforcing the original agreement or being overly controlling. The wife's ability to manage her family's influence is also a factor; if she's unable to stand by the agreement due to family pressure, the author's frustration is valid.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to protect his son's upbringing as per their agreement. However, the use of divorce as a threat might be seen as extreme. It's possible that the author is in a difficult position where he's trying to honor his agreement but is facing resistance from both the wife's family and possibly the wife herself. The answer might depend on cultural context and the specific circumstances of their relationship. If the wife is complicit in allowing her father to interact with the child against the author's wishes, then the author's stance is more justified. But if the wife is also a victim of family pressure, the situation is more complex. In this case, the author is upholding the agreement they had, so he might not be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B: No.\n"
