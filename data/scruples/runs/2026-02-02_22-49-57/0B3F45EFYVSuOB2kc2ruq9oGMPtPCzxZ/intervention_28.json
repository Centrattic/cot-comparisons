She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over raising their son as Muslim. The wife is from a fundamentalist Muslim family, and the author is an atheist. They agreed to raise their kids secularly, but the wife's father started taking their son to the mosque without permission.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is about the child's upbringing. He feels that his wife is going back on their agreement. The wife might be influenced by her family's pressure, which is causing her to act against their prior agreement. The father-in-law's actions (taking the son to the mosque without consent) directly conflict with the parents' agreement. The author seems to be standing by his original stance, which is about respecting the child's secular upbringing.\n\nNow, from a legal and ethical perspective, parents do have the right to make decisions regarding their child's upbringing. However, in many jurisdictions, both parents share this responsibility. If there's a conflict, it's usually resolved through discussion or legal means. The author is taking a firm stance by threatening divorce, which is a significant decision. But considering that the father-in-law is acting without consent and the wife might be complicit, the author is trying to protect his child's upbringing as per their agreement.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance. The wife is an adult and might be influenced by her family. The author should consider whether she's actively complicit or if she's being pressured. If she's not supporting the father's actions and is trying to follow their agreement but her family is interfering, the author's response might be a bit harsh. But given the situation where the father-in-law is acting against their wishes, the author is trying to enforce the agreement they had.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complex. The author is standing up for his values and the agreement they made. The father-in-law's actions are a breach of that agreement. The author's threat of divorce is a strong measure, but it's within his rights as a parent to ensure the child isn't raised against his beliefs. The wife's role here is also important\u2014whether she's enabling the father's actions or resisting them.\n\nSo, considering all points, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's trying to protect his child's upbringing as per their agreement. The father-in-law's actions are problematic, and the author is taking a stand. However, the approach (threatening divorce) might be extreme, but the core issue of protecting the child's upbringing is valid. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
