She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening divorce over his wife's attempts to raise their son as Muslim. The key points here are the initial agreement about raising their children secularly, the father-in-law's actions without consent, and the author's refusal to let the religion influence his son.\n\nFirst, the couple had an agreement that the kids would be raised secularly, which the author respected by not having kids otherwise. The wife agreed to this. Then, after the son was born, her father took the child to the mosque without their knowledge, which violates the agreed-upon secular upbringing. The author is concerned about the father-in-law's influence and the potential religious indoctrination of his son.\n\nThe author's main issue is that his wife's family, despite disliking him, now wants to impose their religion on the child. The author sees this as a contradiction since his wife was supposed to respect his wishes. He's standing by his original agreement but feels the wife isn't upholding her part, possibly due to pressure from her family. He's not blaming the wife directly but is taking a firm stance to protect his son's upbringing.\n\nNow, considering the options: Answer A says the author is in the wrong. That would be if he's overreacting or not respecting his wife's autonomy. Answer B says he's not in the wrong. This would be if he's justified in protecting their agreed-upon parenting decisions and the child's upbringing.\n\nThe author's stance is about honoring the original agreement and protecting his son from unwanted religious influence. The father-in-law's actions are a breach of that agreement, and the author is trying to enforce it. The wife's role here is complex\u2014she might be feeling torn between her family and her husband. The author's decision to threaten divorce is a strong measure, but given the circumstances, if the wife is complicit by not stopping her father, maybe the author is justified in seeking to protect his son's upbringing. However, threatening divorce over this could be seen as extreme, but if there's a prior agreement and it's being violated, it's a matter of enforcing boundaries. The answer depends on whether the author's actions align with the original agreement and the best interest of the child.\n"
