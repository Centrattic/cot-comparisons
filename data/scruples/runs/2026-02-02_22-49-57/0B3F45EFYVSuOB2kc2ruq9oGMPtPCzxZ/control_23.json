She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple with a fundamentalist Muslim background. The wife converted or was raised Muslim, but when they met, she was agnostic. The husband is an atheist, and they agreed to raise their kids secular. Now, the wife's father, who doesn't like the husband (because he's white and from a Christian background), has taken their son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge.\n\nThe husband is upset because he doesn't want his son raised as Muslim, and he's threatening divorce over it. The wife's family is pressuring her, and she's struggling with that. The husband feels he's being undermined and that the father-in-law has control over the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children. If the father is objecting to religious instruction without his consent, there could be legal grounds if the mother is complicit. But since the mother might be involved, it's a family dispute.\n\nEthically, the husband is standing by his beliefs. He's concerned about his son's upbringing and wants to respect his own values. The wife might be conflicted between her family's expectations and her partner's wishes. She might feel pressured from both sides.\n\nThe key points here are: mutual agreement on secular upbringing, the father-in-law's actions without the husband's consent, and the wife's possible compliance. The husband is asserting his parental rights, which is understandable, but threatening divorce over this might be extreme. However, the father-in-law's involvement without consent is a significant issue.\n\nI should check if there's any cultural context I'm missing. In some cultures, family influence is strong, and the husband's resistance might be seen as justified. However, the wife's autonomy is also important. If she's not acting against the husband's wishes, then the father-in-law's actions are the main issue. But if she's allowing or enabling this, that complicates things.\n\nThe husband's position is that he agreed to marriage on the condition that the children would be raised secular. If the wife is going against that by allowing the father to influence the child, then he's protecting his rights. However, threatening divorce might be a last resort, but given the circumstances, maybe he's justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be struggling with her own identity and family pressure. She's an adult and should make her own choices, but if she's enabling her father's actions despite her husband's objections, that could be a problem.\n\nSo, considering all this, the husband is not in the wrong for wanting to protect his son's upbringing as per their agreement. The father-in-law's actions are problematic, and the husband is standing up for his rights. The wife's role here is ambiguous. If she's not supporting the husband's wishes, that could be an issue, but the main conflict is with her father. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
