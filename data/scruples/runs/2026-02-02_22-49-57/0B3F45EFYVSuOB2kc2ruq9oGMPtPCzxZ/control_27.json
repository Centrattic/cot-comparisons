She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over religious upbringing issues. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is an atheist, married to a wife from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They initially agreed to raise their kids secularly. Now, the author's father-in-law is taking their son to the mosque without permission, and the wife might be complicit. The author is threatening divorce if this continues.\n\nSo, the main issue is about conflicting religious upbringing and parental rights. The author is trying to protect his son's upbringing according to their prior agreement. The wife's family is pressuring her, and she might be influenced by them despite the agreement. The author feels his wishes are being ignored regarding their son's religion.\n\nIn terms of legal perspective, usually, both parents have rights in raising children. If there's a disagreement, custody considerations come into play. However, the author is the father, so he has a legal say. The wife's family's actions (taking the child without consent) might be a legal issue too. \n\nEthically, the author is standing by their original agreement. The wife might feel torn between her family and her husband. The author's threat of divorce is a serious step, but he's trying to protect his son's upbringing. However, threatening divorce over this could be seen as extreme, but given the circumstances, maybe justified if the agreement is being broken.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's father is acting against the author's wishes, which is a problem. The author's main concern is the child's religious upbringing. The wife's complicity or lack of action might be a point of contention. The author is trying to assert his parental rights.\n\nI need to consider if the author's threat is a reasonable response. If the wife is not honoring their agreement, especially after the father-in-law's actions, then the author has a right to be upset. However, threatening divorce is a heavy measure. But if the agreement was crucial for their marriage, maybe it's understandable.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's protecting his child's upbringing. The wife might be in a difficult position, but the author's stance is about following their original agreement. The father-in-law's actions are problematic. The author's response is to uphold the agreement, which he's entitled to do. So, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
