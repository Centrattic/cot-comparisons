She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple with conflicting beliefs about raising their child. The author is an atheist, the wife is from a Muslim immigrant family and is now trying to raise their son as Muslim, which the author is against. He's threatening divorce if she continues.\n\nFirst, I should look at the key points. The couple agreed before having kids to raise them secular. The wife's family is fundamentalist Muslim and doesn't like the author because he's white from a Christian background. The father-in-law took the baby to the mosque without permission, dressing him in Muslim clothes. The author is upset about this and has told his wife he'll divorce her if she keeps allowing this.\n\nSo, the main issues are: mutual agreement on child-rearing, the wife's family interfering, and the author's response of threatening divorce. \n\nThe wife's family didn't attend the wedding, yet they're pressuring her to be Muslim. The wife seems to be torn between her family and her husband. The author feels that the father-in-law is overstepping by influencing the child without consent. The author is firm about not letting the child be raised Muslim, even to the point of divorce.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. In many places, parents have shared rights and responsibilities regarding their children's upbringing. If one parent is making decisions without the other's consent, that can be a problem. The father-in-law's actions might be a violation of the parents' agreement. However, the wife's role here is also important. If she's allowing the father-in-law to take the child without the husband's knowledge, that's a breach of trust.\n\nThe author is standing by his original agreement and is trying to protect his son from what he sees as unwanted religious indoctrination. On the other hand, the wife might feel pressured by her family and could be struggling with her own identity and beliefs. The author's response is extreme\u2014threatening divorce\u2014but given the importance of child-rearing, it might be seen as a last resort if communication and compromise aren't working.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's enforcing his boundaries, which is valid. However, threatening divorce immediately might not be the best approach. But given the context of prior agreement and repeated breaches, maybe it's justified. The wife's actions might be contributing to the conflict by not fully respecting the initial agreement. So the author's stance could be seen as defending his principles, hence not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
