She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over how their son is being raised. The author is an atheist, his wife was agnostic but now seems to be leaning towards Islam. The father-in-law is a fundamentalist Muslim, and he took the baby to the mosque without permission. The author is upset that the child is being exposed to religion against his wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to influence their child's upbringing, but there are also laws about religious freedom and child welfare. The father is asserting his right to prevent his child from being raised in a specific religion, which he doesn't agree with. The wife might be conflicted between her family's expectations and her own and her husband's wishes.\n\nThe author's decision to threaten divorce is a serious one. He's using it as a means to enforce his stance on the child's upbringing. However, the wife might feel pressured or manipulated. The key point is whether his approach is justified. If the father-in-law is acting without permission and the mother is complicit, the father has a valid concern about his child's upbringing. On the other hand, the husband's ultimatum could be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is trying to balance her family ties and her marriage.\n\nI should also consider the impact on the wife. She might feel torn between her family and her husband. The author's threat might push her into a difficult position, making her choose between her family and her spouse. That could be emotionally damaging. However, the father is also protecting his child's rights to secular upbringing as they agreed.\n\nThe situation is complex. The author has a right to be involved in his child's upbringing and to object to actions that go against their mutual agreement. But using divorce as a threat might be seen as heavy-handed. However, given the circumstances, he's trying to protect his child from religious influence he opposes. The father-in-law's actions without consent are problematic, and the husband's response is to enforce his boundaries.\n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't entirely wrong because he's standing up for his beliefs and the child's upbringing. But the way he's handling it could be seen as aggressive. However, the main issue is the unauthorized actions of the father-in-law and the wife's possible complicity. The author's stance might be justified in protecting his child's interests, even if the method is confrontational.\n"
