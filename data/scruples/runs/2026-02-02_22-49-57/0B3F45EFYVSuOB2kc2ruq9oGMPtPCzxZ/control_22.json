She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over her religious upbringing of their son. The wife's family is fundamentalist Muslim, and the author is an atheist. They agreed to raise their child secularly. The wife's father took the son to the mosque without the author's knowledge, leading him to confront her and mention possible divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and cultural aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children, but if there's a conflict, courts might favor the child's best interest, which could involve considering the parents' beliefs. However, the wife is an adult, so she has her own autonomy. The author is asserting his right to prevent his son from being raised Muslim against his wishes, but the wife is also a parent with her own beliefs.\n\nThe wife agreed to a secular upbringing initially, but maybe her stance changed? The author feels her family is overstepping, especially the father taking the child without consent. The father-in-law's actions could be seen as violating the parents' agreement. \n\nBut the wife is an adult and might have her own views now. The author is using the threat of divorce as leverage, which might be problematic. Divorce is a major decision, and threatening it because of a disagreement on child-rearing could be seen as extreme. Also, the wife's mental health is mentioned\u2014she becomes depressed around her father, indicating she's struggling between her family and her marriage.\n\nHowever, the father-in-law's actions are a breach of trust and possibly illegal if they involve unauthorized contact with the child. The author is protecting his son's upbringing, which he values highly. But threatening divorce without trying other solutions, like legal intervention or counseling, might be hasty.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is standing up for his beliefs, but the method might be too harsh. The wife might need support to assert her own boundaries with her family. The author's approach could damage the marital relationship and affect the child. So, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but the way he's handling it could be improved. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's defending his child's upbringing, but there's nuance. Alternatively, threatening divorce without considering reconciliation or legal steps might make him at least partially at fault. But the main issue is the father-in-law's actions, not the wife's. The wife is caught in the middle. So the author's stance is about protecting his child, which is valid, but the threat of divorce might be excessive. However, given that the wife agreed to secular upbringing and the father-in-law is interfering, the author's position could be justified. So, the answer is B.\n"
