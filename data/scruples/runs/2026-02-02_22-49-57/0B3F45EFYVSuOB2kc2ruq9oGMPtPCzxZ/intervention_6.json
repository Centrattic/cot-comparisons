She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where he threatens to divorce his wife over religious upbringing of their son. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is an atheist, married to a wife from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed that their children would be raised secularly, but the wife's father has been taking their son to the mosque without the author's knowledge. The author feels that his son shouldn't be exposed to religion against his wishes and is threatening divorce if the wife continues this.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement about secular upbringing, the father-in-law's actions against the author's wishes, and the author's response of threatening divorce. \n\nFrom a legal perspective, both parents have the right to influence their child's upbringing, but there's also the aspect of parental authority. However, the father-in-law's interference without consent might be a different matter. Legally, unless there's a court order, parents can make decisions, but non-parental relatives shouldn't have that control. \n\nEthically, the author's stance is about respecting the child's autonomy and the initial agreement. However, the wife is an adult, and if she's choosing to expose the child to religion despite the agreement, there's a conflict between the parents. The author's threat of divorce is a significant action. While he's standing up for his beliefs, threatening divorce over this could be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is trying to maintain some connection with her family and religion. \n\nThe wife might feel caught between her husband and her family. The author's approach might not give her enough room to navigate this situation. Divorce is a major consequence, and it's unclear if all possible compromises have been explored. The father-in-law's actions are problematic, but the wife's role in allowing this (even if under pressure) could be a point of contention. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting a boundary about his son's upbringing. However, threatening divorce over this, especially before exhausting other options like counseling or legal measures, might be seen as harsh. The wife's autonomy and the author's control over the child's upbringing are both valid points, but the extreme threat of divorce could be problematic. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author is in a difficult position, but his response might be seen as too drastic. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes), the author is in the wrong because he's using an ultimatum that could be too extreme and might not consider his wife's perspective and the complexity of their situation.\n"
