She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple with different religious beliefs. The husband is an atheist, the wife was agnostic but now seems to be leaning towards Islam, especially under her family's pressure. They agreed to raise their kids secularly, but the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband and wife initially agreed on secular upbringing. The wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family, which doesn't accept the husband. The father-in-law is influencing the son against the husband's wishes. The husband's main issue is that he doesn't want his son exposed to religious teachings without his consent. He's threatening divorce if the wife continues to allow this.\n\nNow, in terms of rights, parents usually have the legal authority to make decisions about their child's upbringing, including religion. But if the other parent is not involved in those decisions, there can be conflicts. The husband feels his consent is being ignored. The wife might feel pressured by her family, but she's the one making the choice to let her father interact with the child in that way. \n\nThe husband's statement about possibly divorcing her is a strong action. Is it justified? Well, if the wife agreed to the secular upbringing and still allows her father to take the child to the mosque, it could be seen as a breach of their agreement. However, the husband's approach is to threaten divorce rather than seek a compromise or legal resolution. \n\nBut the husband also mentions that the father-in-law is controlling and the wife is affected by her family's pressure. The wife might be struggling between her husband's wishes and her family's expectations. The husband's stance is about protecting his son's upbringing, which is a valid concern. However, the use of divorce as a threat might be seen as extreme, depending on the context. \n\nIn many cases, such disagreements can be resolved through counseling or legal means rather than divorce. However, the husband's perspective is that he cannot compromise on this issue, which is a significant factor. The question is whether he's in the wrong for taking a firm stand. \n\nI think the answer depends on the balance between the husband's rights as a parent and the wife's autonomy. If the wife is allowing her father to influence their child against the agreed-upon terms, the husband has a right to object. However, threatening divorce without considering other solutions might be seen as harsh. But given the circumstances, maybe he's justified in standing his ground. So, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
