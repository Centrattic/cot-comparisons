She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The user is a father who is an atheist, married to a woman from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their kids secularly, but now the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the father's knowledge. The author is threatening divorce if the wife continues to let this happen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their initial agreement. They both agreed that the kids would be raised secularly unless they choose otherwise. The wife had agreed to that. So the father's stance is based on that agreement. The issue arises when the wife's family is influencing the child against the father's wishes. The father feels that his authority as a parent is being undermined by his in-laws.\n\nThe wife's father is taking the child to the mosque without permission. The father found out and is upset. The father has communicated his concerns to both the wife and the father-in-law, but the actions continue. The father is now threatening divorce if the wife doesn't stop her father's involvement.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, both parents have equal rights to raise their child, but if there's a conflict, especially involving religious practices, courts often consider the child's best interest. However, the father is the one initiating the conflict here by threatening divorce. The wife might be caught in the middle between her family and her husband. She might feel pressured to comply with her father's actions despite her agreement with her husband.\n\nThe father's refusal to let the child be raised as Muslim, even if it leads to divorce, shows he's standing by his original agreement. However, threatening divorce over this might be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is also trying to maintain secular upbringing but her family is interfering. The father's approach could be seen as not allowing the wife to handle her family's pressure, which might affect their marriage negatively.\n\nBut considering that the father is trying to protect his son from being exposed to religious practices against his wishes, he has a point. The in-laws' actions could be considered a violation of the agreed-upon parenting plan. The father's actions are in response to the in-laws' interference, not the wife's actions directly. However, he's directing the threat of divorce at the wife, which could be problematic if she's also a victim of her family's influence.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it right for the father to use divorce as a threat over religious upbringing? It's a serious consequence for a disagreement. The wife might be struggling with her own identity and family pressures. The father's stance is firm, but maybe he should explore other solutions before threatening divorce, especially if the wife is trying to be true to their agreement but is being forced by her family. The father's approach could be seen as not giving the wife enough support to handle her family's pressures, instead of understanding that she might be under coercion.\n\nOn the other hand, the father is protecting his child's upbringing as per their agreement. If the wife is allowing her family to interfere despite knowing the agreement, then the father's frustration is valid. However, threatening divorce might not address the root issue, which is the in-laws' interference, and could harm the marital relationship more than the wife's actions.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the father's actions are a reaction to a breach of their agreement and interference from the wife's family. However, using divorce as a threat in this situation is extreme and might be seen as wrong because it puts the burden on the wife who is already in a difficult position. The correct answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), but there's a nuance here. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong (A) because of the threat of divorce over an issue that involves third parties. But I'm leaning towards B because he's trying to uphold the agreed-upon parenting plan and protecting his son's upbringing.\n"
