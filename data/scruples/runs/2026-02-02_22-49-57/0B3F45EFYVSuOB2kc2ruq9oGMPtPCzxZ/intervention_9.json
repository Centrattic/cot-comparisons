She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with differing religious views, a child, and family pressures.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist, and his wife was originally agnostic. They agreed to raise their children secularly. The wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family that doesn't like the author because of his race and background. Now, the wife's father has taken their son to the mosque without the author's knowledge, violating their agreement. The author is threatening divorce if this continues.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their child, but if one parent is acting against the wishes of the other without consent, there could be issues. However, the father's involvement here might be overstepping. The husband's main concern is about his child being exposed to religious indoctrination against his consent.\n\nThe wife seems to be under pressure from her family. The husband believes she's not protecting their son from her father's influence. The husband's threat of divorce is a serious step, but given the circumstances of parental agreement and now a breach of that trust, maybe he's justified in wanting to enforce their prior agreement.\n\nBut is threatening divorce over this an overreaction? It depends on the context. If the wife is still in agreement with the secular upbringing but her family is acting without her consent, then the husband's stance is about protecting their son. However, if the wife is choosing to allow her father's influence despite the agreement, that complicates things. The key is whether the wife is complicit in allowing the father to interfere without her consent.\n\nThe husband states he has told her multiple times not to let her father do this, but she continues. If she's not heeding his warnings, maybe the husband is right to take a firm stance. The father-in-law's actions are unauthorized, which is a problem. The husband's position is about protecting his son's upbringing as per their mutual agreement.\n\nLegally, in some jurisdictions, both parents have the right to make decisions about their children's upbringing. If one parent is making decisions without the other's consent, that could be a legal issue. The husband's threat might be a way to assert his parental rights.\n\nEthically, it's about respecting the prior agreement and protecting the child from unwanted religious influence. The husband's actions are to uphold the agreement they had. The wife's family's behavior is problematic, and the husband is trying to prevent external influence against his wishes.\n\nHowever, the husband's approach of threatening divorce might be seen as extreme. But given the importance of the child's upbringing and the breach of trust, it could be a justified reaction. The wife may also have a responsibility to stand by her husband's side, especially since they had agreed on this beforehand.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the mutual agreement, the unauthorized actions by the father-in-law, and the husband's attempts to protect their child's upbringing, the husband's stance seems justified. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
