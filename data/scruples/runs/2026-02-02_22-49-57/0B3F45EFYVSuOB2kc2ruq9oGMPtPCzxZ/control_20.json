She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over raising their son as Muslim. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist, and his wife was agnostic when they married. They agreed their child would be raised secular. Now, the wife's Muslim family, especially her father, is pressuring her to raise their son as Muslim. The father took the baby to the mosque without the author's knowledge, and the author is upset because he doesn't want his son exposed to the religion against his wishes.\n\nThe author is asserting his right to have the child raised secular. The wife might feel caught between her family and her husband. The father-in-law's actions are a problem because he's influencing the child without consent. The author feels his parental authority is being undermined. He's threatened divorce if the situation continues.\n\nLegally, in many places, both parents have equal rights. If the author is objecting to religious upbringing, he has a point, but threatening divorce over it is a serious step. However, if the wife is complicit by allowing her father to take the child, maybe the author has a valid concern. The wife's mental health is also a factor\u2014she's depressed after seeing her father. The author might be protecting the child from unwanted religious influence, but the method of threatening divorce is harsh. It's a conflict of rights and values. The author isn't in the wrong if he's standing by his agreement, but the approach might be questioned. However, the key here is whether he's wrong for prioritizing his beliefs over the wife's. Since the father-in-law is acting without consent, the author's stance could be seen as justified. So the answer might be B.\n"
