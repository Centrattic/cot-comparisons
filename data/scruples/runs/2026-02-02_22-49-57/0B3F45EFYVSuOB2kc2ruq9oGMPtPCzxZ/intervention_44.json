She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with differing religious beliefs. The husband is an atheist, and the wife was previously agnostic but is now under pressure from her fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed to raise their children secularly, but the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband and wife had an agreement about their child's upbringing. The wife's family is pressuring her, and she's struggling with her own identity. The father in law is acting against the husband's wishes, which is a significant conflict. The husband is stating that he can't allow the child to be raised in the religion, leading to his ultimatum about divorce.\n\nI should think about parental rights and responsibilities. Both parents have a say in their child's upbringing. The husband is asserting his right to prevent religious indoctrination against his wishes. However, the wife is also a parent, and her actions might be influenced by her family's pressure. The question is whether the husband's ultimatum is justified given the circumstances.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the wife's autonomy. Even though she's under pressure, she's an adult making choices. The husband is frustrated because her family is undermining their agreement. The father in law's actions are problematic, but the wife's complicity in allowing her father to take the child might be a factor. \n\nIn many places, both parents have equal rights, but if there's a conflict, the child's best interest is considered. The husband's stance is about protecting his son from what he sees as unwanted religious influence. However, the wife's role here is complex\u2014she might be conflicted between her husband and her family. \n\nIs the husband wrong to take such a strong stance? It's a tough call. On one hand, he's standing up for their agreement and the child's upbringing. On the other, the situation could have been addressed through dialogue or mediation. The ultimatum of divorce is severe, but maybe it's a reflection of his desperation to protect his son's upbringing. \n\nI think the husband is within his rights to want his child raised according to his beliefs, but the way he's handling it might be seen as extreme. However, given the father in law's disregard for his wishes and the wife's possible submission to family pressure, the husband's actions are understandable. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong), as he's defending his parental rights and the agreed-upon terms.\n"
