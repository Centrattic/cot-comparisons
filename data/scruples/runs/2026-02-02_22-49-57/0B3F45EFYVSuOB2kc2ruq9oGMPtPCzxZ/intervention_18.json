She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author is an atheist, the wife was initially agnostic but comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their children secularly. However, the wife's father has been taking the child to the mosque without the author's consent. The author feels that the father-in-law is exerting too much control over the wife and the child's upbringing.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's standing up for his beliefs and his parental rights. He doesn't want his son exposed to religion against his wishes. He's tried to communicate with his wife and father-in-law but without success. His ultimatum is about protecting his child's upbringing.\n\nOn the other side, the wife might feel pressured by her family, especially if her father is taking matters into his own hands. She might be struggling between her husband's wishes and her family's expectations. But she did agree to secular upbringing initially, so her actions now could be seen as going against that agreement.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement, parental rights, and the father-in-law's interference. The author is asserting his right to co-parenting decisions. However, making a threat of divorce over this could be seen as extreme. Divorce is a major life decision, and using it as a tactic might be considered harsh, even if the issue is serious.\n\nBut considering the context\u2014ongoing pressure from the wife's family and the violation of an agreement\u2014it's a valid parental concern. The author might feel that his input is being ignored, and with the father-in-law acting against his wishes, he's taking a stand for his son's upbringing.\n\nSo, while the author has a legitimate right to be involved in his child's upbringing, the method of using divorce as a threat could be problematic. However, given the circumstances and the breach of their prior agreement, his stance is understandable. It's a complex situation where both sides have valid points, but the author's actions are aimed at protecting his child's secular upbringing as agreed.\n"
