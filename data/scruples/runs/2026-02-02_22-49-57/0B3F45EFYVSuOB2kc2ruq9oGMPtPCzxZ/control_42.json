She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with differing religious beliefs about raising their son. The husband is an atheist, and the wife is from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their children secularly, but the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children, so the husband's stance on not allowing religious instruction without consent might be valid. However, the wife's family's actions could be seen as overstepping boundaries. The father-in-law taking the child without permission is problematic because it bypasses the parents' agreement and the husband's wishes.\n\nThe husband's threat to divorce over this issue is a significant point. While he has the right to his beliefs, using divorce as a threat because of religious disagreements might be seen as extreme. However, given the context that they had a prior agreement and the father-in-law is interfering, the husband might feel that this is the only way to protect his child's upbringing.\n\nThe wife's role is also important. She agreed to the secular upbringing but might be under pressure from her family. Her allowing the father to take the child despite the agreement could be a point of contention. The husband's frustration is understandable, but how he handles it matters. Threatening divorce is a serious step and may be seen as harsh unless there's a clear violation of their agreement.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, parents can agree on the child's upbringing, but neither can force the other's hand. The husband's stance could be legally sound if they have a prior agreement, but the approach of threatening divorce might not be the best conflict resolution method. It could lead to further family discord or legal issues if not handled properly.\n\nEthically, respecting each other's beliefs is key. The husband's concern about his son's upbringing is valid, but the response of threatening divorce might be seen as disproportionate. There might be room for compromise or seeking mediation rather than an ultimatum. However, if the wife is not upholding their agreement and the father-in-law is interfering, the husband's actions might be justified in his eyes to protect his child's future.\n\nIn summary, while the husband has valid concerns about his son's upbringing and the interference from his in-laws, using the threat of divorce as a response might be considered extreme. However, given the prior agreement and the violation of that agreement, his stance could be seen as a defense of his values. The answer might hinge on whether the threat of divorce is proportionate to the situation. Legally, he might be in the right to protect his child's upbringing, but ethically, the method could be questioned.\n"
