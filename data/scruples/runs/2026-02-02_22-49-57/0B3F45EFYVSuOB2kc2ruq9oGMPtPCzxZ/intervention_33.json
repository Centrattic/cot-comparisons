She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nThe author is married to a woman from a fundamentalist Muslim immigrant family. He's an atheist and they agreed secular upbringing for their kids. The wife was initially agnostic but seems to be under pressure from her family. Now that their son is born, the father-in-law has taken the baby to the mosque without the author's knowledge, dressing him in Muslim clothes. The author is threatening divorce if this continues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights to make decisions about their child's upbringing. However, the author is a parent and has the right to object to religious instruction without consent. But he's making a threat of divorce, which is a serious step. The wife might feel caught between her family and her husband.\n\nThe wife's family doesn't like the author because he's white and from a Christian background. The father-in-law's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially without the author's consent. The author has a right to be involved in his child's upbringing. However, the wife is an adult and might have her own views influencing her actions.\n\nThe key points here are the agreement on secular upbringing, the unauthorized involvement of the father-in-law, and the author's response. The author is standing by his beliefs, but threatening divorce over this could be seen as extreme, especially if the wife isn't directly opposing him. However, the father-in-law's actions are a violation of the parents' agreement, so the author has valid concerns.\n\nI need to think about whether the author's response is proportionate. Threatening divorce because of the father-in-law's actions, which he might not have full control over, could be harsh. However, if the wife continues to allow this despite the author's objections, it might be justified. The author's stance is about protecting his child's upbringing as per their agreement, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nIn terms of morality, the author isn't wrong for wanting to protect his son from religious indoctrination against their agreement. However, the threat of divorce might be more about the father-in-law's interference than the wife's actions. The wife's complicity is a factor here. If she's not supporting the author's wishes, that could influence the judgment.\n\nLegally, the author might have a case if the father-in-law is acting without consent, but emotionally and relationally, the threat of divorce could be seen as extreme unless the wife is actively undermining their agreement. The answer hinges on whether the author's response is a reasonable reaction to protect his child's upbringing or if it's an overreaction given the wife's role.\n\nOverall, the author is trying to uphold the agreement they had, so he's probably not in the wrong. But the method of resolving it through divorce might be questionable unless there's no other solution. However, given the circumstances, he has valid reasons to be concerned about his child's upbringing.\n"
