She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves a couple with different religious backgrounds. The husband is an atheist, the wife was agnostic but now seems to be leaning towards Islam, possibly under pressure from her fundamentalist family. They had agreed to raise their children secularly, but the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge. The husband threatens divorce if the wife continues to let this happen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement about secular upbringing. The wife's family is pressuring her, and her father is acting against the husband's wishes by taking the son to religious activities. The husband feels that his rights as a father are being violated. He's threatening divorce to enforce his stance.\n\nNow, legal aspects might play a role here. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children. If one parent is acting against the other's wishes without consent, that could be an issue. However, since the wife is the one allowing her father to take the child, maybe she's complicit. But the husband is taking a hardline approach, threatening divorce. Is that justified?\n\nEthically, the husband is standing up for his values and concerns about his son's upbringing. On the other hand, the wife might be under family pressure and could feel torn. The question is whether the husband has the right to threaten divorce over this. The wife agreed to secular upbringing initially, so maybe she's breaking that agreement now. But perhaps she's facing coercion from her family, complicating her choices.\n\nThe husband's actions could be seen as protecting his child from unwanted religious influence, which is a valid parental concern. However, threatening divorce immediately might be extreme. It's possible that mediation or legal intervention would be a better step before taking such a drastic measure. The wife's autonomy is also a factor\u2014she's an adult, but her family's influence might be affecting her decisions.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, if one parent is trying to convert the child without the other's consent, it could be a legal issue. The husband might have grounds to take legal action to prevent the father-in-law from involving the child in religious activities. However, the threat of divorce primarily targets the wife, not the father-in-law. If the wife is complicit by allowing her father's actions, the husband's frustration is understandable, but the response might be too harsh.\n\nConsidering all this, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the circumstances. If the wife is indeed acting against their prior agreement and the husband is trying to uphold it, he might not be in the wrong. However, the immediate threat of divorce could be seen as extreme. It's possible that the husband is justified in wanting to protect his son's upbringing but might be handling it in a way that could be considered harsh or confrontational without exhausting other options first. The answer might be a nuanced B (not in the wrong), but there are complexities.\n"
