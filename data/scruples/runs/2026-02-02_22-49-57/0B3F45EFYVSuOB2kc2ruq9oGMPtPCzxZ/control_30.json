She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple with conflicting views on raising their son's religion. The husband is atheist, the wife was agnostic but now seems to be leaning towards Islam, possibly under pressure from her fundamentalist family. The husband says he'll divorce her if she continues to raise their son as Muslim, and the wife's father has taken the son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and cultural aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children, but if there's a conflict, courts might consider the child's best interest. The husband's stance is about not wanting the child exposed to religion against his wishes. The wife's family is pressuring her, which might be influencing her decisions. The father-in-law's actions, like taking the child without permission, are a red flag. \n\nThen there's the aspect of consent and communication. The couple had agreed on secular upbringing. If the wife is going back on that agreement, that's a breach of trust. The husband feels his wishes are being ignored, which could be a valid concern. But does that mean he's in the wrong for threatening divorce? Divorce is a serious step, but if there's a fundamental disagreement on child-rearing, it's a valid reason. \n\nAlso, the wife's mental health is mentioned\u2014she becomes depressed after seeing her father. That suggests the father-in-law's influence is harmful. The husband is trying to protect both his wife and the child from that. \n\nHowever, the husband's approach is confrontational. Telling someone you'll divorce them for disagreements can be harsh. But the key here is the agreement they had about their children. If the wife is betraying that agreement under familial pressure, the husband's reaction might be justified. \n\nI should also consider if the husband's actions are overstepping. He's the father, so he has a right to be involved in the child's upbringing. The father-in-law's interference without consent is problematic. The husband is standing up for his parental rights. \n\nIn summary, the husband is trying to uphold the agreement they had, protect his child from unwanted religious influence, and address the interference from his in-laws. The wife might be caught between her family and her partner. The husband isn't necessarily in the wrong here; he's acting based on their prior agreement and the child's best interest. The answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
