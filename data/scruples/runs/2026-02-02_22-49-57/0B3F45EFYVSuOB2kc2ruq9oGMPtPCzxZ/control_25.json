She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over religious upbringing of their son. The situation involves a mixed religious background marriage.\n\nFirst, the man is an atheist, and the wife was initially agnostic. They agreed to raise their children secularly. The wife's family is fundamentalist Muslim, and they have a strained relationship with the husband. The issue arises when the wife's father takes their son to the mosque without the husband's consent, despite their agreement. The husband feels that the father-in-law is exerting undue influence on the child's upbringing against the husband's wishes.\n\nThe key points here are the couple's prior agreement on secular upbringing, the unauthorized actions of the in-law, and the husband's response. The husband is standing by his original agreement and is taking a firm stance to protect his son's upbringing. He's not trying to convert the child but to prevent the in-law's influence. The wife seems to support the home environment but is possibly pressured by her family.\n\nPossible angles to consider: The husband's right to co-parenting decisions, the wife's autonomy versus family pressure, and the impact on the child. However, since the husband is enforcing the initial agreement they had and the father-in-law is acting without consent, the husband's actions might be justified. The wife's role is a bit ambiguous\u2014she agreed to the secular upbringing but perhaps is influenced by her family. The husband is trying to protect his child's upbringing, which is a valid parental concern.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, parents typically have the right to make decisions about their child's upbringing. Since the husband is an atheist and the wife agreed, his stance isn't unreasonable. The father-in-law's actions are overstepping, so the husband's threat to divorce to uphold their agreement might be seen as justified. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
