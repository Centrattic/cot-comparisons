She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for threatening divorce over his wife's attempts to raise their son as Muslim, despite their prior agreement to raise the child secularly.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author is an atheist, and the wife was agnostic when they married. They agreed to raise any children secularly. The wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family who didn't like the author because he's white and from a Christian background. The wife's father took their son to the mosque without the author's knowledge, which the author objects to. The author feels the father-in-law is exerting control over his wife and the son, and he's told his wife that he'll divorce her if she continues to allow this.\n\nNow, considering legal and ethical aspects. In many jurisdictions, parents have the right to make decisions regarding their child's upbringing, but both parents have equal rights. However, if one parent is acting against the other's wishes without agreement, it can become a legal issue. The author might be overstepping by threatening divorce over religious upbringing, which could be a matter of personal choice versus control.\n\nEthically, the author's stance is about respecting his own beliefs and the prior agreement. But by threatening divorce, he might be infringing on his wife's autonomy, especially if she's choosing to involve her family. The wife's actions could be influenced by her family's pressure, but she's an adult and might have her own reasons for wanting to introduce her son to her heritage.\n\nThe author's reaction is driven by concern for his son's upbringing, but the ultimatum could be seen as extreme. Divorce is a major consequence for a disagreement on parenting style. It's important to consider whether there's room for compromise or mediation. The father-in-law's actions are definitely problematic, but the wife's role in allowing this might be a point of contention.\n\nIn some cultures, religious upbringing is deeply important, and the author's refusal to allow any Muslim influence might clash with the wife's cultural background. However, the wife agreed to a secular upbringing initially, so her current actions could be seen as a breach of that agreement.\n\nThe author's main argument is about control over the child's upbringing, which is a valid parental concern. But using the threat of divorce might not be the healthiest approach. It's possible that the author is in a difficult position, trying to protect his child's secular upbringing, but the method he's using could be seen as harsh and controlling, especially if the wife is making her own choices now.\n\nLegally, unless the author has a legal right to enforce the prior agreement (which varies by country), he might not have grounds to force a divorce based solely on this. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author is standing by his beliefs, but the ultimatum could be seen as putting pressure on his wife to conform, which might not be fair if she's trying to honor her family's traditions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns about his child's upbringing and the father-in-law's interference, the threat of divorce over this issue might be disproportionate. The wife's autonomy and the complexity of cultural identity in parenting are factors to consider. The author's stance could be seen as protective but possibly overbearing, leading to the possibility that he is in the wrong for not seeking other solutions before resorting to an ultimatum.\n"
