She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the scenario. The author is an atheist, married to a woman from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed to raise their children secularly. However, the wife's father has taken their son to the mosque without the author's consent, despite the author's refusal. The author feels that the father-in-law is exerting control over the wife and the child, and he's willing to split up if the religious influence continues.\n\nThe main issue here is about parental rights and the agreement between spouses. The couple had a mutual agreement on secular upbringing, but the wife's family is interfering. The author is standing up for his beliefs and the terms they agreed upon. However, threatening divorce over this might be a strong move. \n\nBut I should also consider the wife's perspective. She's in a difficult position, possibly under pressure from her family. The author criticizes her father's actions but also mentions that the wife continues to allow these interactions. Maybe there's a breakdown in communication or compromise. \n\nLegally, both parents have rights. If the author's concerns are about the child's upbringing without the other parent's consent, it's a valid issue. However, the threat of divorce might be seen as extreme unless there's a legal or serious ethical violation. \n\nEthically, the author is prioritizing his non-religious upbringing for the child, which he had agreed upon with his wife. The wife's actions (or her father's) are going against that agreement. The author's stance is about protecting his child from unwanted religious influence, which can be a valid concern. \n\nBut is the threat of divorce justifiable? It depends on the circumstances. If the wife is complicit in allowing the father to take the child, then the author's frustration is understandable. However, making an ultimatum might be seen as harsh unless there's a way to resolve it through discussion or legal means first. \n\nIn some cases, couples might seek mediation or legal advice before making such a drastic decision. The author's position might be firm, but threatening divorce immediately could be viewed as overreacting, especially if the wife is also under family pressure. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author had consistently communicated his stance and the wife continued to act against his wishes, then he's within his rights to protect his son's upbringing as per their agreement. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's threat might be a result of valid concerns about his child's upbringing and his agreement with the wife. However, the method of resolving it through an ultimatum might be problematic. \n\nBut since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the best approach, the answer might lean towards B (No), because he's defending his parental rights and the original agreement. However, if the wife is being manipulated or pressured by her family, maybe the author should have addressed it differently. But given the information, the author's actions are within his rights as a parent and spouse.\n"
