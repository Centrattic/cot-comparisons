She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe user is a man who is married to a woman from an immigrant family that is fundamentalist Muslim. He's an atheist, and when they married, they agreed to raise any children secularly. The wife was initially non-religious too. However, after their son was born, the wife's family (especially her father) is pressuring her to take the child to the mosque and dress him in Muslim clothes. The author found out that the father did this without his knowledge. The father-in-law doesn't respect the author's wishes and treats him as if he's not the father. The author has told his wife that if she continues to allow this, he might divorce her.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The couple agreed on secular upbringing. The wife's family is pushing for religious influence, and the father-in-law is acting in ways the author didn't consent to. The author is asserting his right to have his son raised according to their original agreement. The wife seems to be conflicted, as she's happy in their home but pressured by her family. The author is taking a firm stance to prevent his son from being raised with religion against his wishes.\n\nNow, thinking about parental rights and responsibilities. In many societies, parents have the right to decide on their children's upbringing, including religious education. However, both parents usually share this responsibility. If one parent is going against the agreed plan without the other's consent, that could be a problem. The father-in-law acting without the author's knowledge complicates things further. The author is trying to enforce his boundaries, which might be necessary to protect his son's upbringing as per their agreement.\n\nThe wife's role here is tricky. She's the one who's supposed to uphold the agreement but might be influenced by her family. The author is frustrated that she's not standing up to her family, leading to conflict. The author's threat of divorce is a strong measure, but he's trying to protect what he sees as the agreed-upon parenting plan. \n\nHowever, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the wife agreed to the secular upbringing, then the father-in-law's actions are interfering without consent. The author is defending his child's upbringing, which is a significant aspect of parental rights. On the other hand, if the wife is complicit or not stopping her father from taking the child, maybe there's a breakdown in their agreement. But the author's main issue is with his father-in-law acting unilaterally.\n\nIn terms of the law, in many places, both parents have equal rights, and neither can unilaterally decide the child's upbringing without the other's consent. The father-in-law has no legal rights unless there's a custody arrangement, so his actions are likely a violation of the parents' agreement. The author is trying to assert his rights as a parent, which is understandable.\n\nEthically, the author is standing by his commitment to a secular upbringing. The wife's family's pressure is causing her distress, and the author is trying to prevent external influence. The threat of divorce is a serious step, but it's in response to a breach of their initial agreement. It's possible the author is correct in his stance, though the way he's handling it (threatening divorce) might be seen as extreme. However, given the circumstances\u2014his son being taken without consent and religious indoctrination\u2014it's a significant issue.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author is not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
