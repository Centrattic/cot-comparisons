She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with conflicting religious views about raising their son. The husband is an atheist, and they initially agreed to raise their children secularly. The wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family, but she was agnostic when they married. Now, after the birth of their son, the wife's father is taking the child to the mosque without the husband's knowledge, and the husband is threatening divorce if this continues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple had an agreement about raising their children secularly, and the wife agreed. The husband feels that the father-in-law is exerting control over his son against his wishes. The wife might be conflicted because her family is pressuring her, and she might feel torn between her husband and her family. The husband is taking a firm stance, even threatening divorce.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, parents usually share responsibility in raising children. However, if there's a conflict, the court would typically prioritize the child's best interests. But in this case, the husband is not the one acting against the agreement; it's the wife's father. The husband is trying to enforce the original agreement. However, the wife might be in a difficult position, pressured by her family, and the husband's threat of divorce could be seen as extreme, especially since they've only been married two years and the child is an infant.\n\nThe wife's family's dislike of the husband because he's white adds another layer. The father-in-law's actions might be influenced by that bias. The husband is concerned about religious indoctrination without his consent. But threatening divorce over this could be seen as harsh. The wife's autonomy is also a factor here\u2014she's an adult, and the husband acknowledges she can make her own choices, but this relates to their child.\n\nThere's also the issue of the father-in-law taking the child without permission. The husband tried to communicate with him and was ignored, which is a problem. The husband's stance is about protecting his son's upbringing as agreed, but the method of resolving it by threatening divorce might be too extreme, especially if there's potential for reconciliation or mediation.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the husband is standing up for his beliefs and the agreement they had. However, the threat of divorce over this issue might not be justified if there's a willingness to work through the problem. The wife might feel trapped between her family and her husband, and the husband's approach could be seen as dismissive of her position if she's also struggling with her family's expectations.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the husband's position is about upholding the original agreement and protecting his son's upbringing, but his response of threatening divorce could be seen as too harsh, especially without addressing the issue through dialogue or seeking compromise. Therefore, while the husband is not entirely without merit, his approach might be in the wrong.\n"
