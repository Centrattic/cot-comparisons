She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the question) is in the wrong for threatening to divorce their wife over her continuing to raise their son as Muslim, despite their prior agreement to raise him secular. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple was married for two years, and they had an agreement that their children would be raised secular. The wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family, which doesn't approve of the husband because he's white and from a Christian background. The wife initially was agnostic but now seems to be aligning more with her family's religious expectations. The husband is an atheist and is concerned about his son being exposed to Islam against his wishes, especially since the in-laws are pressuring them and even taking the son to the mosque without permission.\n\nThe key points here are:\n1. The initial agreement on child-rearing.\n2. The wife's actions going against that agreement.\n3. The father-in-law's interference.\n4. The husband's ultimatum leading to potential divorce.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many jurisdictions, both parents have the right to make decisions regarding their child's upbringing, but this can become complicated when there's a disagreement. However, the agreement between the couple is a mutual understanding, so if one party is breaching that, it could be seen as a violation of the agreed terms. \n\nEmotionally and ethically, the husband is standing by his beliefs and the initial agreement. He's concerned about his son's exposure to religion he doesn't support. On the other hand, the wife might be under pressure from her family, leading her to act against the previous agreement. Her family's behavior (not attending the wedding, public disapproval) adds to the tension.\n\nThe husband's ultimatum is a strong action, but given the circumstances, is it justified? If the wife is knowingly going against their agreement, then the husband's stance is about protecting his son's upbringing as per their prior consent. However, threatening divorce over this might be seen as extreme. But considering the father-in-law's actions (taking the child without permission) and the wife's continued cooperation, it's a point of contention.\n\nIn terms of parental rights, both parents have a say, but if one parent is acting unilaterally without the other's consent, it's a breach. The husband's refusal to allow his son to be raised in a way against his wishes could be seen as protecting his parental rights. However, the method of resolving it via threat of divorce might be harsh, but given the circumstances, it's his way of enforcing the agreement.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's trying to uphold the agreement they had. The wife's actions are the issue here. The in-laws' interference is a significant factor. The husband's response, while extreme, is a reaction to the violation of their agreement and external interference in their parenting decisions.\n"
