She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for considering divorce over his wife raising their son as Muslim, despite their previous agreement. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple married two years ago, with the wife from a fundamentalist Muslim immigrant family and the husband an atheist. They agreed to raise their children secularly, but the wife's family is pressuring her to involve the child in Muslim practices, even against the husband's wishes. The father-in-law took the son to the mosque without permission, leading the husband to threaten divorce.\n\nThe main issue here is parental rights and the enforcement of prior agreements. Both parents have the right to make decisions about their child's upbringing. The husband feels his wishes are being ignored, and the grandmother is acting unilaterally. The wife, however, might be caught between her family's expectations and her marriage commitment. \n\nI should consider the legal aspect\u2014laws vary by country, but generally, both parents have equal rights unless a court rules otherwise. However, this is more about personal ethics and the strength of the prior agreement. The husband's stance is about respecting his secular beliefs and the agreement they made. The wife's actions, perhaps influenced by her family, are breaching that agreement. \n\nThe husband's threat of divorce is extreme but might be seen as a last resort if communication fails. The father-in-law's actions are problematic, but the wife's role in continuing to allow this is the crux. The husband has a right to be concerned about his son's upbringing and his wife's autonomy under pressure from her family. \n\nHowever, the author's approach\u2014threatening divorce over this\u2014might be seen as harsh. It's possible he's not giving enough room for the wife's own agency. But given the circumstances, he's trying to protect his beliefs and his son's upbringing. The answer hinges on whether enforcing the prior agreement justifies such a drastic measure. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author might not be in the wrong because he's upholding the agreement. However, the method (threatening divorce) could be seen as extreme. But considering the context\u2014family pressure, breach of trust\u2014it's a complex situation where his stance is defensible. So, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
