She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim. The author is an atheist, the wife was agnostic when they married but comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise the kids secular. Now the wife's father is taking the son to the mosque without consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children. If the father is objecting to religious instruction, there might be legal grounds to contest it, but typically, the decision-making is shared. So if the wife is cooperating with her father despite the agreement, maybe the author has a right to be upset.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author feels his wishes are being ignored, and the father-in-law is influencing the child against the father's consent. The wife's family not respecting the father's boundaries could be a problem. But the wife is an adult and might feel pressured by her family, leading her to comply. The author's ultimatum might be extreme, but if the compromise was violated, he's within his rights to seek a resolution.\n\nThe wife's perspective is important too. She might be caught between her husband and her family, leading to her depression. The author might not fully grasp the emotional toll on her. However, the author is standing up for his beliefs and protecting his child's upbringing as per their agreement.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, while the author's approach is firm, it's not necessarily wrong if the agreement was genuine and the wife is breaking it. But the situation is complex, and a better approach might have been to seek mediation first. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether breaking the agreed-upon terms justifies the threat of divorce. Given the circumstances, I think B (No) is the right choice because he's defending his parental rights as per their initial agreement.\n"
