She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with differing religious beliefs and a disagreement over their child's upbringing.\n\nFirst, the husband is an atheist, and the wife was initially agnostic. They agreed to raise their children secularly. However, the wife's immigrant Muslim family, who disapprove of the husband's background, are pressuring her to involve their son in Islamic practices. The father-in-law took the child to the mosque without the husband's consent, which is a key point here.\n\nThe husband feels that his wishes about the child's upbringing are being ignored. He's asserting his right as a parent to have control over his son's religious education. The wife, on the other hand, might be caught between her family's expectations and her marriage. She agreed to secular upbringing but is possibly influenced by her family's pressure.\n\nThe main issue is about parental rights and the conflict between the couple's agreement versus the mother's family's actions. The husband is standing firm on his decision, even threatening divorce. The question is whether this makes him wrong.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, both parents have equal rights in raising their children unless a court decides otherwise. However, this case is complicated by the fact that the father is objecting to the maternal side's influence. The husband's actions are in line with wanting to prevent religious indoctrination against his wishes, which is a valid parental concern. The wife's family's actions might be seen as overstepping, especially without the father's consent.\n\nThe husband's ultimatum about divorce is a strong move. While his position on the child's upbringing is understandable, using a divorce threat as a means to enforce his wishes could be seen as extreme. However, considering the context\u2014his wife's family disregarding his parenting rights and the initial agreement\u2014he might be justified in asserting his boundaries. The wife's own happiness and the father-in-law's control over her also add layers to the situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on balancing parental rights, the agreement between spouses, and the family dynamics. The husband's stance on the child's upbringing is reasonable given their prior agreement, but the method he uses to enforce it (threatening divorce) could be seen as harsh. However, if the father-in-law is directly violating the husband's parental rights by taking the child without permission, then the husband's reaction is more about protecting his child's upbringing. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (No), but there's nuance. However, since the key point is the father's right to make decisions about his child's religious upbringing, and the other parent's family interfering without consent, the husband isn't wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
