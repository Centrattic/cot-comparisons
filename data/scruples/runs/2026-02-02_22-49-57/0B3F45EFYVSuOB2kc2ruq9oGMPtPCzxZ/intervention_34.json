She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over her continuing to raise their son as Muslim, despite their prior agreement to raise the children secularly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and his wife had an agreement that their children would be raised secularly. The wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family, and her father is pressuring her to involve the child in religious practices. The author discovered that the father took the son to the mosque without permission. The author feels that his wife is not upholding their agreement and is allowing her family to influence their child against his wishes.\n\nThe author's stance is that he's an atheist, doesn't want the child to be forced into religion, and is willing to divorce if the wife continues to comply with her family's wishes. The wife might be conflicted between her family's expectations and her own relationship with her husband. She might feel pressured by her family and the father might not be respecting her autonomy as an adult, even though he's concerned about the child's upbringing.\n\nIn many cultures, parents have the right to make decisions about their children's upbringing, but this can lead to conflicts when there are differing beliefs. The author's position is that he's standing by his original agreement and protecting his son from what he sees as unwanted religious indoctrination. However, threatening divorce over this issue could be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is also an adult who might have her own reasons for wanting to maintain some connection to her heritage.\n\nThe father-in-law's actions of taking the child to the mosque without consent is a problem, but the author's response is to threaten divorce, which could be seen as an overreaction. The wife's autonomy should be considered\u2014maybe she's trying to navigate her own identity and family pressures. The author is in a position of power as the father, and using divorce as a ultimatum might not be the healthiest approach. It's important to find a compromise rather than taking such a drastic step.\n\nSo, while the author has valid concerns about his son's upbringing against his wishes, his approach of threatening divorce might be too harsh. The wife's situation is complex, and the author needs to consider her autonomy and the nuances of her position. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for making such a final decision without addressing the issues collaboratively.\n"
