She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is an atheist, his wife used to be agnostic but now is being pressured by her Muslim family. They agreed to raise their kids secularly, but the wife's father took their son to the mosque against the author's wishes. The author is threatening divorce if this continues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parents had an agreement about secular upbringing. The father-in-law is exerting influence without the father's consent. The wife might be conflicted, since she's living with her husband and they have a home where they're free from religious practices. The father-in-law's actions are a breach of that agreement, according to the author.\n\nThe author's main concern is protecting his son from religious indoctrination by the father-in-law. The wife seems to agree with the secular approach when at home but maybe is influenced by her family. The father-in-law is not respecting the father's wishes, which is a big issue here.\n\nNow, the author is threatening divorce if the wife continues to let her father influence their son. Is that justified? Well, the agreement was mutual. If the wife is complicit, even if under pressure, she's not honoring their agreement. The father is standing up for his rights regarding his child's upbringing. However, threatening divorce over this could be seen as extreme, but maybe it's a last resort given the circumstances.\n\nThe wife's autonomy is a factor too. The author mentions she's an adult and can do as she pleases, but when it comes to their child, the father is asserting his right to co-parenting. The father-in-law's actions are unauthorized, which is a problem.\n\nLegally, both parents have equal rights in child custody and upbringing. If the father is preventing religious influence against the mother's actions, that's a valid concern. But the author's approach of threatening divorce might be harsh, but given the importance of the child's upbringing, some might see it as justified.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the wife's mental health. She's happy at home but depressed after visiting her father. The father-in-law's pressure could be affecting her, which in turn affects the child. The author is trying to protect both his wife and son from this pressure.\n\nHowever, the author's ultimatum could strain the marriage irreparably. But given that the wife agreed to secular upbringing initially and the father-in-law's interference is ongoing, the author might feel this is the only way to protect his son.\n\nSo considering all angles, the author's actions are based on protecting his child's upbringing and respecting the prior agreement. While the threat of divorce is serious, the underlying issue is the unauthorized influence on the child. The author is not in the wrong because he's upholding the agreement and protecting his son's rights.\n"
