She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over religious upbringing of their son. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist, and his wife was agnostic when they married. They agreed to raise their children secularly. Now, the wife's family, who are fundamentalist Muslims, is pressuring them. The father-in-law took the son to the mosque without the author's knowledge. The author is upset about this and has told his wife he'll divorce her if she continues allowing this.\n\nI need to consider legal, ethical, and relationship aspects. Legally, parents usually have joint custody rights, but if there's a conflict in upbringing, courts might consider the child's best interests. However, the author is making a personal choice based on his beliefs. Ethically, it's about respecting each other's boundaries. The wife might feel torn between her family and her husband. The author's stance is about protecting his son from religious indoctrination against his wishes. But threatening divorce is a serious step. It's important to assess if communication and compromise were attempted. The user says the author has tried multiple times, and the father-in-law is not listening. The wife might be in a difficult position, caught between her husband and her family. The author's frustration is understandable, but is the threat of divorce justified? Maybe there are other ways to handle it, like legal measures or counseling. However, the core issue is about parental rights and beliefs. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions are seen as protecting his son or overstepping in the relationship. Since the wife agreed to secular upbringing initially, the author's position is defensible, but the approach could be seen as extreme. However, given the context, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
