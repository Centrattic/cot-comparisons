She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over her continuing to raise their son as Muslim. They married with an agreement to raise the kids secularly. The wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family, and the author is an atheist. The father-in-law took the son to the mosque without the author's knowledge. The author says he won't let the father-in-law influence the son and is considering divorce if the wife continues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement on secular upbringing. The wife's family is pressuring her, and she's being influenced, leading to actions against the author's wishes. The father-in-law is acting uncooperatively. The author is firm about not allowing religious upbringing against his wishes. The wife might be caught between her family and her husband.\n\nThe author's main issue is about the child's upbringing. The wife agreed to the secular approach but her family is interfering. The father-in-law's actions are against the parents' agreement. The author feels it's his right to protect his son from religion, so he's taking a hard stance. \n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, he's standing up for his beliefs regarding his child's upbringing. However, threatening divorce is a serious step. The wife might be conflicted, and the author's ultimatum could be seen as extreme. But considering the initial agreement, maybe he's justified. However, maybe there's a way to resolve it without divorce. The wife's autonomy is also a factor\u2014she's an adult and can choose, but they had an agreement she's breaking. The father-in-law's actions are problematic, but the wife's role in continuing to allow contact is key. The author's right to co-parenting decisions is important. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, both parents have equal say in child-rearing, so the father's stance is valid. However, threatening divorce over this might be seen as harsh. But if the wife is violating the agreement, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer likely depends on cultural and personal values. Since the user is asking for a yes or no, considering the agreement and the father-in-law's interference, the author might not be in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
