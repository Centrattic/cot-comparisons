She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is an atheist, and his wife was previously agnostic. They agreed that their children would be raised secularly. Now, the wife's family, who are fundamentalist Muslims, are pressuring them. The wife's father took their son to the mosque without the author's knowledge, which he strongly opposes. The author feels that he's being undermined and that his child's upbringing is being influenced against his wishes.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement on secular upbringing, the breach of trust when the grandfather took the child, and the author's reaction. The author is asserting his parental rights to decide the child's upbringing. However, the wife might feel that her cultural background and family's influence is important to her and the child. \n\nBut in this case, the grandfather acted without consent, which could be a violation of the parents' agreement. The author's threat to divorce if this continues might be seen as a way to protect his child's upbringing, but it's also a significant ultimatum. However, in many jurisdictions, both parents have equal rights, and neither can force their religion on the child without the other's consent. \n\nThe author is standing up for his beliefs and the agreement they made. However, the approach of threatening divorce might be seen as extreme. But given that the other parent's family is interfering without consent, maybe it's justified. The answer hinges on balancing parental rights and the impact of the threat. The author is not necessarily in the wrong if he's trying to uphold the agreement and protect his child's upbringing, especially when the other parent isn't preventing the interference.\n"
