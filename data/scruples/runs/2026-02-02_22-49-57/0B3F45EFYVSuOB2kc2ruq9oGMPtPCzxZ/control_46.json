She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A or B. I need to figure out if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist and married to a wife from an immigrant Muslim family. They agreed to raise their kids secularly. However, the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the author's knowledge. The author is threatening divorce if this continues.\n\nI need to consider the key points. The wife agreed to secular upbringing, but her family's influence is causing issues. The father-in-law is acting against the father's wishes. The author is frustrated because he doesn't want his son raised Muslim. But is threatening divorce a reasonable response?\n\nWell, the wife is an adult and has her own family. The author's main issue is with the father-in-law's actions. The wife might be conflicted between her family and her husband. The author is trying to protect his son from religious indoctrination, which he didn't agree to. However, the wife is the parent, and the father-in-law's actions may be against her wishes. The author didn't consult the wife directly about the father's actions, he just found out through her. But he did tell her multiple times not to let the father in law do that. The father in law is ignoring him.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations: parents have rights, but both parents need to agree on child-rearing. If the father-in-law is acting without the consent of both parents, that's problematic. The author is trying to prevent religious influence he opposes. However, threatening divorce over this could be harsh, but given the circumstances, maybe it's a strong stance because it's about the child's upbringing. The wife might feel torn, but the author is standing by his original agreement. The wife did agree to secular upbringing, so if she's not stopping her father, maybe the author is within his rights to take a firm stance. However, divorce as a threat might be extreme unless there's no other solution. But the father-in-law's actions are a direct violation of their agreement. The author's position is that he doesn't want his son raised Muslim, and he's trying to prevent it. So, is he wrong? Maybe not. But maybe there's a better approach than threatening divorce. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because he's asserting his parental rights regarding his child's upbringing.\n"
