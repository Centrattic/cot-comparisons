She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with conflicting religious beliefs about raising their son.\n\nFirst, the husband is an atheist, and the wife used to be agnostic. They agreed to raise their kids secular. Now, the wife's family is pressuring her to involve their son in Islam. The father-in-law took the son to the mosque without permission, which the husband found out about. The husband then threatens divorce if the wife continues to allow this.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. The couple had a mutual agreement on secular upbringing. The father-in-law's actions are against that agreement, and the wife might be complicit by not stopping him. The husband's reaction is to set a firm boundary, leading to potential divorce.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, the husband is standing by the original agreement. The wife's family's interference is a problem, and the father-in-law is acting without consent. The husband is protecting his son's upbringing as per their agreement. However, threatening divorce over this might be seen as extreme. However, given the breach of trust and the wife's possible inability to resist her family's influence, maybe the husband feels it's necessary to enforce the agreement.\n\nBut the wife might have her own reasons for not resisting more. Maybe she feels pressured by her family. The husband's approach could be seen as respecting his own boundaries but not considering her position. But since they had a prior agreement, and she's not upholding her end, he's justified in enforcing it.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's upholding the agreement they had, even if the method of threatening divorce is harsh. The father-in-law's actions are the main issue here, but the wife's role in allowing it could be a factor. However, the husband's stance is about the child's upbringing, which is his right as a parent.\n"
