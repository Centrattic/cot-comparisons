She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim, given the context.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist, and they had an agreement before having kids that they'd be raised secular. The wife, from a fundamentalist Muslim family, initially agreed, but now her father is taking the son to the mosque without consent. The author feels betrayed and is considering divorce to prevent his son from being influenced against his wishes.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. Parental rights: in many jurisdictions, both parents have a say in their child's upbringing. However, the author is making a unilateral decision about the child's religion, which could be problematic. The wife is an adult and has her own beliefs now, even if they were different before the marriage. The father-in-law's actions without consent are a concern, but the wife's complicity might be an issue if she allows her father to influence the child despite the agreement.\n\nLegal perspective: Divorce threats based on religious upbringing could be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is acting on her own beliefs now. However, the father-in-law's interference without the husband's consent is a red flag. The husband's stance on not wanting the child raised in a specific religion is his right, but he's using divorce as leverage, which might be seen as harsh if the wife is also an active parent.\n\nEthically, the husband is trying to protect his child from what he sees as unwanted religious influence, but he's dismissing his wife's current beliefs and autonomy. The wife might feel pressured to conform to her husband's wishes, especially since she's already facing pressure from her family. The husband's reaction could be seen as controlling if he's not allowing the wife to make her own decisions about their child's upbringing, especially since she's an adult and part of the parenting team.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the child. Raising a child in a specific religion without the other parent's agreement can lead to conflict. However, the husband is taking an extreme stance by threatening divorce, which might not be necessary if there's a compromise. But given the father-in-law's involvement without consent, the husband's concerns are valid about external influence.\n\nIn conclusion, while the husband has valid concerns about his son's upbringing and the interference from his in-laws, using divorce as a threat to enforce his stance might be seen as extreme. The wife's autonomy and the child's best interests need to be balanced. However, the father-in-law's actions are a breach of trust and the original agreement, which complicates things. The husband's position isn't entirely without merit, but his approach could be problematic. The answer isn't straightforward, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he's standing up for his beliefs and protecting his son from unwanted influence, even if the method is harsh.\n"
