She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim, despite their prior agreement. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is an atheist, and his wife was agnostic when they married. They agreed to raise any children secularly. Now that their son is born, the wife's family (fundamentalist Muslims) is pressuring her to involve the child in their religion. The wife's father took the son to the mosque without the author's knowledge, leading the author to threaten divorce.\n\nSo, where's the conflict? The author believes he has the right to decide the child's upbringing, even though the wife is the one making the decisions. The wife might feel that her religious background is being imposed, but she agreed to a secular upbringing. However, now she's possibly being influenced by her family again, which the author is resisting.\n\nLegal perspective: In many places, both parents have equal rights in child rearing unless there's a court order. The author isn't the biological parent, but he's the father of the child. If they're married, both have rights. But if the author is not the biological father, the legal dynamics might be different. However, the question doesn't specify that, so assuming he is the father.\n\nThe wife's family taking the child without consent is a red flag. The author's right to object is valid, but his response\u2014threatening divorce\u2014could be seen as extreme. However, if the wife is going against their agreement, perhaps the author is justified.\n\nEthically, the author wants to prevent the child from being raised in a religion he disagrees with. The wife might feel her cultural identity is important. The author's threat of divorce is a drastic measure, but if the wife is not respecting the agreement, it's a conflict of values.\n\nThe wife's behavior: She agreed to secular upbringing but is now influenced by her family. If she's enabling the father to take the child, maybe she's not standing by their agreement. The author's frustration is understandable, but threatening divorce over this is a big step.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong: The author has the right to protect his child's upbringing as per their agreement. However, using divorce as a threat might be seen as coercive, especially if there's a way to resolve through legal means or counseling. The wife's autonomy is also a factor; if she's an adult making her own choices, the author can't control her decisions. But as a parent, he has rights too.\n\nPossible answer: The author isn't in the wrong because he's standing up for his beliefs and the agreed parenting plan. However, the method of resolving the conflict (threatening divorce) is questionable. But since the wife is going against the agreement, maybe the author is justified. But I need to check if threatening divorce is a valid response. In some cultures, it's a way to enforce boundaries, but legally, it's not a solution. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance.\n"
