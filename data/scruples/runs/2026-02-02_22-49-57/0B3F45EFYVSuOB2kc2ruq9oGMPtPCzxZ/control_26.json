She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe author is an atheist, and his wife was also agnostic when they were dating. They had a pre-arranged agreement that their children would be raised secularly, which the wife agreed to. Now, after having a son, the wife's family, who are fundamentalist Muslims, is pressuring them to take the baby to their mosque and dress him in Muslim clothes. The author found out that the father-in-law took the son there without their knowledge. The author is upset because he feels his wishes are being ignored, and he's threatened to divorce if the wife continues to allow the religious upbringing. The wife seems to be under a lot of stress from her family, but the author is firm about his stance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. In many jurisdictions, both parents have equal rights in raising their child. The wife's family is exerting pressure without the father's consent, which is a problem. The author's agreement with his wife was that the kids would be raised secularly. If the wife is allowing her father to influence their son against the agreed terms, that might be a breach of their mutual understanding. However, the wife's actions could be influenced by her family's expectations, and she might be struggling with her own beliefs or obligations.\n\nThe author says he's told his wife he can't allow the son to be raised that way, even if it means splitting up. This is a serious ultimatum. On one hand, he's standing up for his beliefs and what he thinks is best for the child. On the other hand, threatening divorce over this could be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is feeling pressured by her family and might be conflicted. It's possible she's trying to maintain her family relationships while respecting her original agreement with the husband.\n\nThere's also the issue of the father-in-law's actions. Taking the baby without permission and influencing him, even if it's religious, is a violation of the parents' rights. The author is right to be concerned about unauthorized exposure to religion. But maybe the wife isn't aware of the full extent of what's happening, or she's being coerced by her family. The author's approach of a direct threat might not allow for resolving the conflict through communication or legal means first.\n\nI should also think about the wife's mental state. She comes back depressed and ashamed after seeing her father, which indicates that her family's behavior is affecting her negatively. If she's being manipulated or forced into actions against her will, the author might be justified in stepping in. However, if she's willingly engaging with her family to the detriment of their agreement, then the author's response could be more about enforcing their initial terms.\n\nAnother angle is the child's best interest. The author is prioritizing a secular upbringing, while the father-in-law is trying to impose religion. The mother's family might believe they're helping the child's spiritual growth, but the father disagrees. The key here is whether the wife is respecting the father's wishes. If she's complicit in allowing the grandfather to influence the child without the father's consent, that could be problematic.\n\nBut the author's statement that he's ready to divorce is a major consequence. Divorce is a serious step, especially in a new relationship. Some might argue that there's a need for more discussion between the couple to see if they can find a compromise or a better way to handle the family pressure. The wife might be in a difficult position, caught between her husband's wishes and her family's expectations. The author might not be considering the emotional toll it's taking on her.\n\nIn terms of laws, in most places, both parents have shared responsibility, and one parent can't unilaterally decide the child's upbringing without the other's consent. If the wife is allowing her father to make those decisions without the husband's agreement, that could be a legal issue as well. However, the wife is an adult and can make her own decisions unless there's a legal agreement in place. The author's initial agreement with the wife might not be enforceable legally unless there's a formal arrangement, but morally, it's a point of contention.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his beliefs and the agreed terms. However, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening divorce\u2014might be seen as harsh. The wife might need support in dealing with her family's pressure rather than facing a divorce threat. The author could be right about not wanting the child raised against his wishes, but perhaps the approach could be more collaborative. For example, working with the wife to set boundaries with her family or seeking counseling to address the conflict within the marriage first.\n\nThe father-in-law's actions are definitely problematic because he's acting without the other parent's consent. The author is justified in being upset about that. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for responding with a divorce ultimatum. It's a complex situation. The wife's agency is important here. If she's not complying with her husband's wishes, maybe there's a breakdown in communication. The author's refusal to let his son be influenced might be valid, but the solution should involve working together with his wife rather than a unilateral threat.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect his son's upbringing as per their agreement, but his method of threatening divorce could be problematic. It might be better to address the issue with the wife directly, maybe through mediation or family counseling, before considering such a drastic step. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but with the caveat that the approach could be improved. However, since the question is a yes or no, and given the context of the wife's family's interference and the initial agreement, the author has a valid stance. So the answer is B.\n"
