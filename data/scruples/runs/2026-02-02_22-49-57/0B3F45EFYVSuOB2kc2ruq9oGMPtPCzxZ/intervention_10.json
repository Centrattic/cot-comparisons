She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who is an atheist married to a woman from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed to raise their children secularly, but the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's consent. The husband threatens divorce if she continues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement about their children's upbringing. The husband is clear about not wanting them raised as Muslim, even if they choose later. The wife's family is pressuring them, and her father is acting against the husband's wishes. The husband feels that his input is being ignored, and he's frustrated that his son is being exposed to religion without his consent.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if that's correct. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nLegally, parents have equal rights in their children's upbringing, but this is more about cultural and personal beliefs. The husband's stance is about respecting their prior agreement. The wife might feel torn between her husband and her family. The father-in-law's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially without the husband's consent. \n\nHowever, the wife is an adult and might be complicit if she allows her father to take the child. The husband's threat of divorce is a strong move, but it's in response to a breach of their agreement. It's possible the wife is also being pressured by her family, which complicates things. \n\nI need to weigh whether the husband is justified in threatening divorce. Since they had an agreement, and he's standing by it, maybe he's not wrong. But maybe he's being too controlling. However, the father-in-law's actions are the main issue here. The husband is trying to protect his son from religious influence he disagrees with. \n\nIn many places, parents have the right to make decisions about their child's upbringing unless a court rules otherwise. The husband is enforcing that. The wife might need to mediate with her family. The threat of divorce is extreme but perhaps a last resort. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
