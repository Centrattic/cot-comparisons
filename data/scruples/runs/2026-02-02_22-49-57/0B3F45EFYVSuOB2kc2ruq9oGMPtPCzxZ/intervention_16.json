She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a child, where the husband is an atheist and the wife is from a Muslim immigrant family. They had agreed to raise their children secularly, but the wife's father is pressuring them, and the father-in-law took the child to the mosque without the husband's consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband and wife initially agreed on secular upbringing. The wife's family is fundamentalist Muslim, and they didn't attend the wedding, showing disapproval. The father-in-law is taking the child to the mosque and dressing him in Muslim clothes without the husband's knowledge. The husband feels that his authority as a parent is being undermined and that the child's upbringing is not respecting his wishes. He's threatening divorce if the situation continues.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the husband) isn't in the wrong, but wants a perspective. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to evaluate based on principles of parental rights, autonomy, and the dynamics of interfaith relationships. In many places, parents have the right to decide their children's upbringing, including religious education. However, in this case, the mother's family is involved without the father's consent, which could be problematic. The husband is standing by his agreement and protecting his son's upbringing as per their initial mutual understanding. The wife might be conflicted between her family's expectations and her personal beliefs.\n\nBut there's a potential issue here: the husband is threatening divorce if the wife continues to comply with her father's wishes. While he has a right to his beliefs, threatening divorce over a disagreement about child-rearing could be seen as extreme. However, the father-in-law's actions are unauthorized and possibly violating the parents' agreement. The husband's stance is to protect his child from being raised in a way he disagrees with, which might be within his rights.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's autonomy is also a factor. If she's an adult and chooses to allow her father to influence the child, the husband's response might be seen as overstepping, but given the unauthorized actions, he's trying to assert his parental rights. There's a conflict between the parents' decisions and the influence of the external family member.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, both parents have equal say in the child's upbringing unless a court decision is made. If the husband is the sole voice, and the wife is in agreement with the father's actions, he might be justified in seeking legal recourse. However, threatening divorce because of the wife's actions could be seen as extreme, but given the context of unauthorized religious instruction, it's a complex situation.\n\nThe husband is trying to uphold the initial agreement, and the father-in-law's actions are a violation of that agreement. The husband's response is to take a firm stance to protect his son's upbringing. Considering that, he might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
