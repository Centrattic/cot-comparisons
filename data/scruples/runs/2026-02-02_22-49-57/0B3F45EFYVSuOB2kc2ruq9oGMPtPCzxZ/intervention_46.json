She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with differing religious beliefs and a conflict over how their child should be raised.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist, his wife was previously too, but now she's starting to lean towards Islam, influenced by her family. They had agreed on a secular upbringing. The wife's family, who are fundamentalist Muslims, are pressuring her to raise their son as Muslim. The father-in-law took the baby to the mosque without the author's knowledge, which led the author to threaten divorce if the pattern continues.\n\nThe author's main points are about parental rights and respect for his wishes regarding their son's upbringing. The wife, according to the author, is being pressured by her family and might be going along with it despite their prior agreement. The author feels that the father-in-law is overstepping by influencing the child without consent.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, parents have the right to make decisions about their child's upbringing, including religion. However, if one parent is acting against the other's wishes without mutual agreement, it can lead to conflict. The author's stance is that he wants a secular upbringing, and he's firm about it, even to the point of divorce. The wife is caught in the middle between her family's expectations and her husband's wishes.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his beliefs and protecting his child's upbringing as per his agreement with his wife. However, threatening divorce over this might be extreme. But given the circumstances\u2014his wife's family is actively trying to influence the child against his wishes, and she's not fully resisting it\u2014his position might be justified. The key here is whether the author is respecting his wife's autonomy as an adult while still protecting their child's upbringing. The wife is an adult, so he can't control her actions, but he can decide the environment of their home and their son's upbringing.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might need to resolve this conflict with her family. The author's firm stance might be necessary to enforce their prior agreement. The father-in-law's actions are problematic because they involve the child without the other parent's consent. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect their son's upbringing. The answer would be B.\n"
