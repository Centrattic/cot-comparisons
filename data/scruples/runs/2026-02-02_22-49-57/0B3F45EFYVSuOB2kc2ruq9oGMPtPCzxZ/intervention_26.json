She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about conflicting beliefs in a marriage regarding raising their child. The author is an atheist, his wife was also agnostic when they married, but her family is fundamentalist Muslim. They agreed to raise their children secularly. However, the wife's father took their son to the mosque without permission, which led the author to threaten divorce if the situation continues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had a mutual agreement before having kids. The wife's family is pressuring her and the child, despite the father's objections. The author feels his wishes about the child's upbringing are being violated by his in-laws. He's taking a firm stance to protect his son from being indoctrinated into a religion he's against. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to assess if the author's response is justified. The threat of divorce over this issue is significant. In many jurisdictions, parents have rights to make decisions about their children's upbringing. If one parent is going against the other's wishes and the child's best interest, it can be a point of conflict. The father is trying to prevent religious indoctrination by the other parent's family, which he wasn't part of. \n\nHowever, the wife is an adult and capable of making her own decisions. The author is also acknowledging that she can choose her own path as an adult. The main issue here is about the child's upbringing. The father believes he has a right to decide how his son is raised, especially since the mother's family is acting without consent. The fact that the father-in-law is pressuring the mother and the child despite the father's objections might be a problem. \n\nIn terms of legal perspective, parents have shared decision-making rights unless otherwise determined. If there's a conflict between parents, it might require mediation or court involvement. The author's threat of divorce is a personal choice, but it's a serious consequence. The question is whether the author's actions are reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nThe user's side is that the author is right because the other parent's family is violating the agreed-upon secular upbringing. The author is trying to protect his son's future. However, the wife's role as a parent is also important. If she's complicit in allowing the grandfather to influence the child against the father's wishes, that's a separate issue. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is standing up for his beliefs and the child's upbringing as agreed. The threat of divorce is a strong measure, but it's within his rights as a parent to prioritize his child's upbringing as he sees fit. The in-laws' actions are a breach of that agreement. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
