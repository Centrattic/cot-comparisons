She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author of the story is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is married to a woman from a fundamentalist Muslim immigrant family. He's an atheist and they agreed to raise their kids secular. The wife was agnostic at the time. Now they have a son, and the wife's father is taking the baby to the mosque without the author's knowledge. The author is threatening divorce if the wife continues to let this happen.\n\nSo, the key points here are the parental rights regarding religious upbringing. Both parents have a say in their child's upbringing. The author is against any forced religious instruction, especially from the father-in-law. The wife seems to be conflicted, as she's happy in her home but pressured by her family when visiting.\n\nThe author is firm about not wanting the child raised as Muslim, which is his right as a parent. However, he's threatening divorce if the wife doesn't comply. The wife might feel trapped between her husband's wishes and her family's expectations. But since she agreed to a secular upbringing initially, maybe she's not in the wrong for trying to keep things neutral. However, if she's allowing her father to influence the child without her husband's consent, that could be an issue.\n\nLegally, both parents have rights, and decisions about religious upbringing should be mutual. If the wife is enabling her father's actions, that might be problematic. But the author's response of threatening divorce is a strong move. It's important to consider if there's a way to resolve this without splitting up, like mediation or legal intervention to enforce their agreed secular upbringing.\n\nThe father-in-law's actions might be overstepping, as he's not the legal parent. The author has a right to be involved in the child's upbringing. However, using divorce as a threat every time there's a disagreement might not be the healthiest approach. The author's stance is about protecting his child's upbringing, which is valid, but the method of handling the conflict could be questioned. Maybe there are other ways to address the father-in-law's interference without ending the marriage.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's standing up for his beliefs and the agreed-upon parenting plan. However, the way he's handling the conflict (threatening divorce) might be seen as extreme. The wife's actions in allowing her father to take the child could also be problematic. But since the question is about the author's wrongdoing, the answer hinges on whether his actions are justified. Given the circumstances, B (not in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
