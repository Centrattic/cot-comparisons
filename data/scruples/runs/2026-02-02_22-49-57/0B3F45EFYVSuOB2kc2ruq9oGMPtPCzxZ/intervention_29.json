She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is a man who is married to a wife from an immigrant family that's fundamentalist Muslim. He's an atheist, and when they met, she was agnostic. They agreed to raise any kids secularly, allowing them to choose later. Now that their son is born, the wife's family is pressuring them to involve the son in Muslim practices. The author found out that his father-in-law took the son to the mosque without permission, dressed him in Muslim clothes. The author is upset about this and told his wife that if she continues to allow this, he'll divorce her. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The couple had an agreement about raising their child secularly. The wife's family is pressuring her, and she's struggling between her family's expectations and her husband's wishes. The father-in-law is taking actions without the husband's consent, which the author sees as a violation of their agreement. The author feels that his input as the father is being ignored, and he's taking a firm stance.\n\nNow, thinking about parental rights and responsibilities. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children. If both parents agreed on secular upbringing, but one parent is allowing the other parent's family to influence the child against the other parent's wishes, that could be a problem. The author is trying to protect his son from religious indoctrination, which he's against, and he's standing by his original agreement with his wife.\n\nHowever, the wife might be caught in the middle. She's part of a family that's pushing for religious practices, and she might feel pressure from her family to conform. The author's ultimatum could add stress on her. But the author is asserting his right as a father to have a say in his child's upbringing, especially since the child is his as well.\n\nThere's also the issue of the father-in-law acting without consent. Taking the child to the mosque and dressing him in religious clothes without the father's knowledge is a breach of the agreement the couple had. The author is justified in being upset because his wishes aren't being respected. However, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening divorce\u2014might be extreme. But given the circumstances, maybe it's a last resort.\n\nI should also consider cultural and religious aspects. The wife's family is from a fundamentalist Muslim background, which might value religious upbringing highly. The author's atheism contrasts with that, leading to conflict. The wife might be trying to navigate between her family's expectations and her husband's desires. The author's stance is about protecting his son's autonomy in the future by not being forced into a religion.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? He's standing up for his beliefs and the agreement they made. The father-in-law's actions are the ones that broke the agreement. The wife might be complicit if she's allowing this without stopping it. The author's threat of divorce is a serious measure, but if he's committed to secular upbringing and the other parent is not adhering to that, maybe it's a valid response. Alternatively, maybe there's a middle ground, like counseling or legal steps to resolve the custody or upbringing issues without divorce.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's following through on his original agreement and trying to protect his son's upbringing as agreed, then he's not in the wrong. The father-in-law's actions are the problem here. The wife might be in a difficult position, but the author's actions are in line with his original stance. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
