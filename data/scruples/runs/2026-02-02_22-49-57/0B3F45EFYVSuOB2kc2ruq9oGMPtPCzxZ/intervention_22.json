She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of a given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with a son, where the husband is an atheist and the wife is from a Muslim immigrant family. They agreed that their children would be raised secularly. However, the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque and dressing him in Muslim clothes without the husband's consent. The husband threatens divorce if this continues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple had an agreement on raising their children secularly. The father-in-law is pressuring the wife, and she's not standing up to his influence. The husband is frustrated because his son is being exposed to religious practices without his consent. He's at his limit and threatens divorce.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The wife agreed to the secular upbringing, so using that as a reason for divorce might be seen as justified because he's honoring the agreement. However, he's also using an ultimatum, which can be seen as extreme. But the father-in-law's actions are a significant factor here. The husband is trying to protect his son's upbringing, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be struggling with her own family's expectations versus her marriage. She's allowing her father to take the child without the husband's knowledge, which could be a breach of trust. The husband's reaction is about enforcing their prior agreement and protecting his child's upbringing. Threatening divorce is a serious step, but if the wife continues to violate the agreement, the husband's stance might be defensible.\n\nLegal aspects might come into play. In many places, both parents have equal rights in child custody, so the husband has the right to object to others influencing the child's upbringing. The wife's actions might be enabling her father's interference, which the husband is trying to stop. \n\nEmotionally, the husband feels his autonomy as a father is being disregarded. The wife might feel torn between her family and her husband. The husband's ultimatum is a response to ongoing stress and breach of trust. \n\nConsidering all this, the husband's position isn't without fault. Using divorce as a threat is a strong move, but given the circumstances\u2014protecting the child's upbringing and prior agreement\u2014it might be justified. The wife's actions have contributed to the situation by not standing up to her father and allowing the interference. \n\nSo, the answer is likely that the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
