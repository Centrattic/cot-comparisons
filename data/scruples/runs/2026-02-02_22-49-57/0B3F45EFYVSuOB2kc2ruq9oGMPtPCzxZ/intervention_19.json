She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple with conflicting views on raising their child. The husband is an atheist, and the wife is from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their kids secularly, but the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge. The husband is threatening divorce if the wife continues to go along with this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children. The husband is concerned about his son being exposed to religious teachings without his consent. The wife, however, might feel pressured by her family and possibly has her own beliefs that are evolving. \n\nThe husband's actions\u2014threatening divorce\u2014seem extreme, but maybe he feels that his boundaries are being crossed. The father-in-law's actions are a problem because he's making decisions about the child without the other parent's consent. The wife might be caught between her husband and her family, which complicates things. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong for threatening divorce? Well, if the wife is actively going against their agreement by allowing the father-in-law to influence their son, then the husband's stance might be justified from his perspective. However, threatening divorce over a disagreement, even a significant one, could be seen as harsh. It might be better to seek mediation or legal advice first. \n\nBut the key point is the child's upbringing. Both parents have a right to their beliefs, but they also have a responsibility to respect each other's wishes unless there's a legal issue. The father-in-law's actions are unauthorized, which complicates the situation. The husband's main issue is that his son is being exposed to religion without his consent, which he sees as a violation of their prior agreement.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the wife is complicit in allowing her father to take the child, then the husband's frustration is valid. However, threatening divorce might not be the best approach. The husband's position is that he wants to raise the child secularly, and if the wife is not upholding that, then he's within his rights to express that he can't continue the marriage. However, maybe there's a middle ground. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the husband's actions (threatening divorce) are justified given the circumstances. If the wife is not respecting their agreement and the other parent is overstepping, then the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, using divorce as a threat might be seen as extreme. But given the context of the father-in-law's interference and the wife's possible complicity, the husband's stance could be seen as protecting his child's upbringing. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
