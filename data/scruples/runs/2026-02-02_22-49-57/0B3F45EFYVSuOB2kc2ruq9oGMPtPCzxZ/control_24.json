She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening divorce over his wife's actions regarding their son's religious upbringing. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist, and they had an agreement that their children would be raised secular. The wife, from a fundamentalist Muslim family, initially agreed. However, her father took their son to the mosque without permission. The author feels that the father-in-law is exerting undue influence and wants to protect his son from being raised Muslim, even if it means divorce.\n\nKey points: The couple had an agreement. The wife's family is pressuring her, and her father is acting against the agreed-upon terms. The author is standing by his belief that the child should not be raised in a religious environment against his wishes. \n\nBut wait, the wife is an adult and has autonomy. The author is using the threat of divorce to enforce his will on how the child is raised. However, the father-in-law is directly involved, which complicates things. The author might be right in protecting his son from unwanted religious influence, but the method\u2014threatening divorce\u2014could be questionable if it's about controlling the wife's choices, even if she's complicit.\n\nAlso, in many places, both parents have equal rights in child-rearing. If the wife is allowing her father to influence the child, the author might have legal grounds to object. However, the author's approach could be seen as extreme. Instead of threatening divorce, maybe seeking mediation or legal intervention would be more appropriate. \n\nBut the wife's agency matters too. If she's complicit, the author's frustration is understandable. However, the decision to raise a child's religion is a major one, and both parents should agree. Since they had an agreement, the wife breaking it by allowing her father's influence could justify the author's stance. \n\nStill, threatening divorce over this is a heavy measure. It depends on whether the author is prioritizing his religious beliefs over the wife's autonomy and the child's best interest in a balanced way. There's a fine line here. The author's rights as a parent clash with the wife's family's influence. If he's taking a firm stand to protect his son's upbringing as agreed, maybe he's justified. But if he's using divorce to control the wife's actions, that's problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, the situation is complex. The author's threat is a strong action, but given the breach of their agreement and the external interference, he might not be entirely in the wrong. However, the method could be seen as harsh, but considering the circumstances, it's a tough call. The answer might lean towards B (No), as he's standing up for his beliefs and the agreed-upon parenting plan.\n"
