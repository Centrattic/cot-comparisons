She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with differing religious beliefs. The husband is an atheist, and the wife was originally agnostic but now seems to be leaning towards raising their son as Muslim, possibly under pressure from her family. The wife's father even took the child to a mosque without the husband's consent, despite prior agreements.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband and wife had an agreement before having children to raise them secularly. The husband made it clear he didn't want the religion to be forced on the kids. The wife, however, is under pressure from her family, who are fundamentalist Muslims. The father-in-law is involved in the child's life in ways the husband objects to, leading the husband to threaten divorce.\n\nNow, the husband's main issue is that he wants to raise the child secularly, but the wife and her family are pushing for Muslim upbringing. The wife's actions, like going to the mosque with the child without consent and the father-in-law's continued interference, are the triggers for the husband's ultimatum.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, both parents have equal rights to make decisions about their child's upbringing. However, if one parent is acting against the other's wishes without their consent, that could lead to legal disputes. But the husband is using the threat of divorce as a response, which is a personal choice rather than a legal matter.\n\nEthically, the question is about respecting agreements and the rights of each parent. The husband and wife had an agreement, but the wife might be changing her stance. The wife's family's pressure adds another layer, but the husband is concerned about his son being exposed to a religion he opposes. The wife's father's actions seem to be a breach of the husband's wishes, which could justify the husband's anger.\n\nHowever, the wife is an adult, and while the husband is the parent, the wife might have her own reasons for wanting to involve her family. The husband's threat of divorce is a serious move. It's possible that the wife is caught between her family and her husband, causing her distress. The husband's approach might be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is trying to maintain her relationship with her family while also being in the marriage. But the husband's stance is about protecting his child's upbringing as per their agreement.\n\nThere's a balance between respecting each parent's beliefs and the child's best interests. The husband might feel that his initial agreement is being broken, leading him to take a firm stand. The wife might be struggling with her own identity and family expectations, which complicates the issue.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband is not in the wrong because he is standing by his initial agreement and protecting his child from an upbringing he explicitly opposed. However, the approach of threatening divorce could be seen as harsh. But given the circumstances, his position is understandable. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
