She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with differing religious beliefs and issues over how their child should be raised. The husband is an atheist, the wife is from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their children secularly. However, the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge, which the husband opposes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement before having kids. The father feels the son is being exposed to religion against his wishes, and the mother's family is exerting influence. The father is threatening divorce if the situation continues. The wife is caught between her family and her husband.\n\nI should think about consent and respect in relationships. Both parties had an agreement, so the mother might be breaking that agreement by allowing her father to influence the child. However, the mother might be under pressure from her family, which complicates things. The father's threat of divorce is a strong measure. Is it justified? Maybe if the mother is not honoring the agreement, but maybe there's more to her actions.\n\nAlso, the father-in-law's actions without consent are problematic. The husband has a right to be involved in his child's upbringing. However, the mother's autonomy is also important. The husband's ultimatum seems extreme, but perhaps it's because he's trying to protect his child's upbringing as they agreed.\n\nLegal aspects vary, but generally, both parents have rights. If the mother is acting without the father's consent, that could be an issue. But the father threatening divorce over this might be seen as overreacting, unless the mother is consistently violating their agreement. The mother's family's behavior is also a factor\u2014maybe she's not in the wrong for trying to balance family expectations with her relationship.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the father is prioritizing his values, but the threat of divorce might be a heavy response. The mother might need support to resist her family's influence. The key is whether the mother is willingly allowing her father to influence the child against the father's wishes. If she is, then the father's stance has merit. If she's being forced, it's a different scenario.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the mother is complicit in allowing her father to take the child. If she is, the father's position is understandable. If she's not, then the father is overstepping. The scenario says the wife agreed initially but then her father took the child without consent. The husband told her about his stance, but she continued to let it happen. So she might be acting against their agreement, making the husband's reaction justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
