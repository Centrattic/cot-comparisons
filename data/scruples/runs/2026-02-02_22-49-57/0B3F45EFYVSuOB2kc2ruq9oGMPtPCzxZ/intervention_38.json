She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with conflicting beliefs about raising their child. The husband is an atheist, and the wife is from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their son secularly, but the wife's father has taken the child to the mosque without the husband's consent, leading the husband to threaten divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parents had an agreement about secular upbringing. The wife's family is pressuring her, and despite her agreeing to the secular approach, there's a breach when the father-in-law takes the son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge. The husband feels that his wishes are being ignored, and he's threatened divorce over this.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, both parents have equal rights to make decisions about their child's upbringing unless there's a court order. However, the husband is asserting his right to prevent religious indoctrination, which is a personal belief. The wife, on the other hand, might feel pressured by her family and perhaps her own cultural background. \n\nEmotionally, the wife seems to be in a difficult position. She's happy at home with her husband but is influenced by her family's expectations. The husband is firm in his stance, prioritizing his beliefs and the child's upbringing. The father-in-law's actions are a problem because they go against the parents' agreement.\n\nThe husband's threat of divorce is a significant step. It's a response to a breach of trust and agreement. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether there's a valid reason to enforce the original agreement. Since the father-in-law acted without consent, the husband's reaction might be seen as protecting his parental rights. However, divorce as a threat might be extreme, but given the circumstances, it's a way to enforce his boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be struggling with her own identity and family pressures. She agreed to secular upbringing but might be facing external pressures. The husband's approach is firm, but it's based on respecting their initial agreement and the child's upbringing. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he's standing by his original agreement and protecting his son's upbringing as per their mutual understanding. The father-in-law's actions crossed a line by involving the child without consent, and the husband has the right to object. However, the use of divorce as a threat could be seen as harsh, but given the context, it's a way to enforce his stance.\n"
