She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over the religious upbringing of their son. The situation is complex, involving cultural and religious differences, family pressure, and parental authority.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist who married a woman who was previously agnostic but now seems to be aligning more with her Muslim family's expectations. They had agreed that their children would be raised secular. However, the wife's father has been influencing their son, taking him to the mosque without the father's knowledge. The author feels that his son is being exposed to religion against his wishes, leading him to consider divorce.\n\nThe key points here are the prior agreement on secular upbringing, the father-in-law's interference, and the husband's firm stance. The husband is asserting his right to make decisions about his child's upbringing, which is a significant parental right. However, the wife might be caught between her family's expectations and her marriage. The husband's threat to divorce if the situation doesn't change is a strong move, but it's important to consider whether it's justified.\n\nIn many legal systems, both parents have the right to make decisions about their child's upbringing, but there's also a duty to consider the child's best interests. If one parent is acting unilaterally against the agreed-upon plan, especially with family influence, the other parent may feel compelled to take strong action. However, using divorce as a threat over a significant disagreement could be seen as extreme, even if the husband's concerns are valid.\n\nThe husband's stance might not be in the wrong because he's protecting his son from religious indoctrination without his consent. But his approach\u2014threatening divorce\u2014could be seen as harsh, especially if the wife is also a victim of family pressure. The wife might be in a difficult position, trying to balance her own beliefs and her family's expectations with her marriage. The husband's firmness could be necessary, but the method of handling it might lack empathy or a willingness to seek compromise.\n\nIn conclusion, while the husband's intentions are clear and his right to co-decide his son's upbringing is valid, the way he's handling the situation\u2014threatening divorce without considering other solutions\u2014might be problematic. However, given the circumstances and the prior agreement, his stance could be seen as justified. The answer might hinge on cultural contexts and specific family dynamics not fully detailed here.\n"
