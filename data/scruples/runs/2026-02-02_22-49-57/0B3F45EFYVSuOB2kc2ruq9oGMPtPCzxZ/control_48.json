She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple with different religious beliefs, and a conflict over how to raise their son.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist, and the wife was initially agnostic but comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their children secularly. However, the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque and dressing him in Muslim clothes without the author's knowledge. The author feels that the father-in-law is exerting too much control over their child and the wife, and he's threatening divorce to prevent the son from being raised Muslim.\n\nSo, the main points here are the violation of the prior agreement about child-rearing, the father-in-law's actions without the father's consent, and the author's response of threatening divorce. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors to consider are: parental rights and responsibilities, the validity of the prior agreement, the role of the father-in-law, and the appropriateness of the author's threat of divorce.\n\nThe author and wife had an agreement to raise the children secularly. If the wife is allowing her father to influence the child against this agreement, she might be breaking the terms they had. However, the author's response of threatening divorce is a serious action. While the author has the right to protect his child's upbringing according to his beliefs, using a divorce threat as leverage might be seen as extreme. \n\nBut considering the father-in-law's actions are against the parents' agreement and without the author's consent, the author has a valid concern. The wife might be struggling between her family's expectations and her own relationship with her husband. The author's stance is about protecting his son's upbringing, which is a legitimate parental right. However, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening divorce\u2014could be seen as harsh, especially if there's potential for reconciliation or if the wife isn't entirely in agreement with her father's actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the father-in-law's interference without the father's consent is problematic. The author is justified in wanting to prevent his son from being exposed to religion against their prior agreement. But the threat of divorce over this might be disproportionate unless there's a complete unwillingness from the wife to adhere to their original agreement. If the wife is being pressured by her father and perhaps not standing up for their agreement, the author's frustration is understandable. However, the resolution through divorce might not address the underlying issues in their marriage.\n\nIn legal terms, parents generally have the right to make decisions about their children's upbringing. If one parent is undermining the other's authority, it could lead to legal disputes. But in a marital context, the threat of divorce is a personal decision. The author's main issue is with the father-in-law's actions, which the wife might be complicit in, but it's unclear if she's actively supporting her father's actions or just being influenced. If she's not in agreement, the author's approach might be too harsh.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to protect his son's upbringing, but the method of threatening divorce could be seen as extreme. However, given the context of prior agreement and the father-in-law's interference, the author's stance might be justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
