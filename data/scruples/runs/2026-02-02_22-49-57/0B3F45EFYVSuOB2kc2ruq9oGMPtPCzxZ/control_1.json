She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over her continuing to raise their son as Muslim, despite their prior agreement to raise the child secularly. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the situation. The couple married two years ago, agreed on secular upbringing, but the wife, influenced by her fundamentalist Muslim family, is now taking the child to the mosque against the husband's wishes. The husband feels his wishes are being disregarded and is considering divorce to prevent his son from being raised Muslim.\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The wife comes from a family that's not accepting of the husband, who is white and from a Christian background. The family's disapproval is mentioned, and they didn't attend the wedding. Now, the wife's father is taking the child to the mosque without the husband's consent. The husband feels that his authority as a parent is being undermined by the father-in-law.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that he's an atheist, and he didn't agree to the religious upbringing. He's making a firm stand that if the wife continues, he'll leave. The wife seems to be conflicted but still allowing the father to influence their son. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for taking this stance.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, both parents have the right to make decisions regarding their child's upbringing. However, since they are married, there's a shared responsibility. The husband's decision to threaten divorce over the religious upbringing might be seen as extreme, but he's also asserting his parental rights.\n\nEthically, it's a matter of autonomy versus religious freedom. The wife might feel her cultural identity is important, but the husband is concerned about the child's upbringing against his wishes. The father-in-law's actions are complicating things, as he's directly involved without the husband's consent.\n\nThe husband's statement that the wife is an adult and can do what she wants, but he refuses to let the father-in-law influence the child, suggests he's trying to protect the child from external influence. However, threatening divorce over this could be seen as harsh, especially if the wife is trying to balance her own cultural background with her husband's wishes.\n\nIt's also important to consider communication. The husband mentions he's told her many times, but she continues. Perhaps there's a breakdown in communication or the wife feels pressured by her family. The husband's response is to ultimatum, which might not address the underlying issues and could be seen as inflexible.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a complex situation. The husband is standing by his original agreement, and the wife is acting against it. However, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening divorce\u2014could be seen as extreme. There might be a need for mediation or counseling rather than immediate divorce. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's asserting his parental rights, but there's nuance in how he's approaching the situation.\n"
