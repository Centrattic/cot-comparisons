She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for threatening divorce over his wife's religious upbringing of their son. Let me start by parsing the details.\n\nThe author is an atheist, married to a wife from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their kids secularly, but now the wife's father is taking their son to a mosque without the author's consent. The author is upset that the father-in-law is influencing the child against his wishes and has told his wife he'll divorce her if she continues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal angle. In many places, parents have the right to raise their children according to their beliefs, but there are limits, especially if it's harmful. However, here it's about the maternal side influencing the child without the consent of the other parent. The author feels his parental rights are being violated.\n\nThen there's the marital agreement. They had a prior agreement on secular upbringing. The wife might be going against that, perhaps under pressure from her family. The author is standing by his original terms, which were a condition for having children. That's a strong point in his favor regarding his stance.\n\nThe wife's actions: she agreed to the secular upbringing but her father is acting without her knowledge. Maybe she isn't fully in control due to her family's influence. The author might be trying to protect his son from unwanted religious indoctrination, which he has a right to be concerned about.\n\nConflict in the marriage: The author is willing to end the marriage if the wife doesn't comply. That's a drastic measure, but if the wife is continuing to allow the father to influence their son despite knowing the author's objections, maybe he's justified. However, communication is key. Did he give her enough chance to address the issue? Maybe there's a middle ground they haven't found yet.\n\nThe wife is also an adult and can choose her actions, but as a parent, the author has co-parenting rights. The father-in-law's actions are part of the problem, but the wife's complicity or inability to stop it is a factor. The author's threat might be extreme, but if the wife isn't addressing the issue, his frustration is understandable.\n\nLegally, in many cases, both parents have equal say in child-rearing unless specified otherwise. If the wife is allowing her father to influence the child without the other parent's consent, that could be a problem. The author is asserting his parental rights, which he has.\n\nEthically, it's about respecting the child's upbringing as agreed. The wife's family's pressure complicates things, but the author is trying to uphold the original agreement. His willingness to leave might be harsh, but the principle is about protecting the child's upbringing as per mutual agreement.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's protecting his parental rights and the agreed-upon upbringing. The wife might be influenced by her family, but her actions are still against their prior agreement. The author's threat is a reaction to a breach of that agreement. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
