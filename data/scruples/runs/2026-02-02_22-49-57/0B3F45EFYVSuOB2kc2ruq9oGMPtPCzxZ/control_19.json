She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with differing religious beliefs and their son's upbringing.\n\nFirst, the husband is an atheist, and the wife was initially agnostic. They agreed to raise their children secularly. However, the wife's family, who are fundamentalist Muslims, are pressuring them. The wife's father took their son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge, which the husband finds unacceptable. The husband threatens divorce if the wife continues to allow this.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. The couple had an agreement about secular upbringing. The wife is under pressure from her family, which is causing her distress. The husband feels that his wishes regarding his son's upbringing are being disregarded, especially since the father-in-law is acting uncooperatively. The husband's ultimatum is about the child's religious upbringing, even if it means divorce.\n\nLegally, in many places, both parents have equal say in their child's upbringing unless there's a court decision. However, since the wife is acting against the husband's wishes, there's a conflict. Emotionally, the husband is firm because he values secularism, but the wife might feel torn between her husband and her family. The father-in-law's actions are a problem because he's acting without the husband's consent, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe husband's threat of divorce seems harsh, but given the circumstances, he's trying to protect his son's upbringing. The wife might be in a difficult position, possibly manipulated by her family. The user is asking if the husband is in the wrong. \n\nSome might argue that the husband shouldn't use a divorce threat over religious upbringing, especially in a marriage where both parties initially agreed. Others might say he has a right to protect his child's upbringing as per their agreement. The wife's father's actions are a breach of that agreement, so the husband's stance could be justified. However, the approach of using divorce as a threat might be seen as extreme, even if the issue is serious.\n\nBut considering the husband's perspective, he's standing up for what he believes is right for their son. The wife might need to take a stronger stand against her family's influence to uphold the original agreement. The husband isn't wrong for wanting to protect his son from unwanted religious influence, but the method of handling it through an ultimatum might be problematic. However, the main issue is the violation of their mutual agreement by the wife's actions and her father's interference. \n\nIn conclusion, the husband isn't in the wrong because he's defending the agreed-upon upbringing of their child against an external influence that the wife isn't stopping. His stance is about protecting his son's future, even if the method is extreme. The answer would be B (No).\n"
