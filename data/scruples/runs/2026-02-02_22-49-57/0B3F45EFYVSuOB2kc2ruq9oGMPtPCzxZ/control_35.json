She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author is an atheist married to a wife from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed to raise their children secularly, but the wife's father is pressuring to expose their son to Islam, even secretly taking him to the mosque. The author threatens divorce if this continues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement about raising their children secularly. The father-in-law is overstepping by taking the child without consent. The wife seems to be in a difficult position, caught between her husband and her family. The author is firm about his stance, even to the point of divorce.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe author's perspective is that he's protecting his son from religion he doesn't agree with. He's standing by his original agreement with his wife. The wife's family's actions are against their prior agreement. The father-in-law's actions are unauthorized and possibly manipulative. The author's threat of divorce is a strong measure, but maybe justified if the wife isn't respecting the agreement.\n\nBut wait, the wife might be conflicted. She agreed to secular upbringing, but her family's pressure might be influencing her. The author accuses her father of controlling her, which could be true. However, the author is making a unilateral decision about the child's upbringing, which is a significant life aspect. In many places, both parents have equal say in their child's upbringing unless there's a legal agreement otherwise.\n\nIf the author had discussed this with his wife and not just the father-in-law, it might have been different. But he's taking a hard stance without maybe resolving the issue through mutual discussion. The threat of divorce over this might be extreme, especially if the wife is already struggling with her family's pressure.\n\nOn the other hand, the father-in-law's actions are problematic. Taking the child without consent is a breach of trust. The author has a valid concern about his child's upbringing. However, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening divorce\u2014might not address the root issue of the wife's family involvement. Perhaps counseling or mediation would be better.\n\nBut according to the scenario, the author has tried to communicate but the father-in-law ignores him. The author's stance is that he won't let the child be raised in a certain religion against his wishes. Legally, both parents have rights, but the wife's actions (allowing her father to take the child) might be at fault. However, if the wife is also under pressure, it's a complex situation.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's threat of divorce is justified. Since the child's upbringing was mutually agreed upon, and the wife is not adhering to that agreement (possibly due to her family's influence), the author might feel justified. However, the approach of threatening divorce without trying to resolve it collaboratively could be seen as extreme. The author is in a difficult position, but maybe there's a better way than divorce. However, the answer options are A or B, not a nuanced response.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is standing by his decision to protect his child from a religion he opposes. The father-in-law's actions are indeed problematic. The wife's family's behavior is disrespectful and controlling. The author's actions are in line with protecting his child's upbringing. However, threatening divorce is a major step. But given that the wife agreed to the secular upbringing, and her actions are undermining that, the author might not be in the wrong. So the answer could be B (No). But I need to check if there's a cultural or other factor I'm missing. Also, in some cultures, religion is very important, and the author's firm stance might be seen as dismissive of the wife's background. However, the original agreement was secular, so he's sticking to that. The father-in-law's actions are the main issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
