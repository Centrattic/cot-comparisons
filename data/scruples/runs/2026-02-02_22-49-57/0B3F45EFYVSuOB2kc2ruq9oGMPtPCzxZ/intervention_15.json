She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim. The wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family, while the author is an atheist. They agreed to raise the kids secularly. However, the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the author's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the author's stance is about parental rights and religious upbringing. He's concerned about his son being exposed to religious teachings against his wishes. The wife may feel torn between her husband and her family's expectations. The author is firm, even to the point of divorce, which is a significant step. But is he right?\n\nThe wife's actions\u2014allowing her father to take the child\u2014could be seen as violating their prior agreement. However, marriages involve compromises. The author's ultimatum might be justified if he feels the child's upbringing is being compromised. On the other hand, threatening divorce over this could be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is struggling between two cultures. Legally, both parents have equal rights, but the situation's complexity involves family dynamics and cultural pressures. The author isn't in the wrong because he's standing up for his beliefs and the child's upbringing, which is a parent's right. The wife's family overstepping by taking the child without consent is problematic. So, the answer is B.\n"
