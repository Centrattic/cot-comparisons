She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a man who is an atheist, married to a wife from a Muslim immigrant family. They had agreed to raise their children secularly. The wife's family, especially her father, is pressuring them to raise the son as Muslim. The father-in-law took the child to the mosque without the author's knowledge. The author then told his wife he would divorce her if she continues to allow this.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the initial agreement about raising the child, the breach of that trust by the father-in-law's actions, and the author's threat of divorce. The wife seems to be caught between her family's expectations and her husband's wishes. The author is concerned about his son's upbringing against his religious beliefs.\n\nFirst, the couple had an agreement before having children. That's important. If they didn't have that agreement, maybe it's different, but in this case, they did. The wife agreed to secular upbringing. Then the father-in-law's actions go against that agreement. The author is upset because the child is being exposed to a religion he doesn't want. But the wife is continuing to facilitate this, perhaps under pressure from her family.\n\nThe author's response is to threaten divorce. Now, is that justified? Well, it's a serious matter. The parents usually have shared responsibility in raising the child. But if the wife is acting against the agreed-upon terms, the husband feels that his boundaries are crossed. However, threatening divorce over this could be seen as extreme. But the father-in-law's actions are a big part of the problem here. The author is trying to protect his son's upbringing.\n\nBut wait, the wife is an adult and can make her own choices. The author might be overstepping if he's dictating her actions with a threat of divorce. Also, in some legal systems, both parents have equal say in the child's upbringing unless there's a court order. However, the father-in-law isn't a parent, so his actions are unauthorized. The author has a right to object to his son being taken without consent.\n\nThe wife might be struggling with her own identity here. She was agnostic before marriage but now her family is pressuring her to be Muslim. She might be feeling torn. The author is frustrated because she's not standing up to her family, which could contribute to the tension.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's standing up for his beliefs and the agreed upbringing of the child. But threatening divorce is a drastic measure. However, if the wife is knowingly violating the agreement and the father-in-law is acting against the father's wishes, the author's reaction is about protecting his child's upbringing. But maybe there's a middle ground. Did the author try to communicate with his wife first? The text says he told her many times, but she continues. The father-in-law is ignoring him. So the author feels that the only way to enforce the agreement is to end the marriage.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't wrong for wanting to protect his son's upbringing. However, threatening divorce might be an extreme response. But if the couple had a binding agreement, and one party is violating it, the other might feel justified in ending the marriage. The problem is whether the wife is part of this violation. If she's taking the child to her father despite the agreement, she's complicit. The author's threat is a reaction to her actions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's position is about enforcing the agreed terms of parenting. He's not in the wrong because he's trying to uphold the pre-agreed secular upbringing. The wife's actions and her family's actions are the issue. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
