She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple with different religious views. The author is an atheist, and his wife was also an agnostic when they married. They agreed to raise their children secularly, but the wife's family, who are fundamentalist Muslims, are pressuring her to raise their son as Muslim. The father-in-law took the baby to the mosque without the author's knowledge, dressing him in Muslim clothes. The author threatens divorce if the wife continues to comply with her family's wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement about secular upbringing. The wife might be struggling with her family's pressure. The father-in-law is acting in a way that disregards the father's wishes. The author is concerned about his son's exposure to religion against his wishes. The wife might feel torn between her husband and her family.\n\nThe author is standing by his original agreement, which the wife agreed to. However, he's threatening divorce because the wife is allowing her father to influence their child. The wife might feel that she's being pulled in two directions. But the author is asserting his right to make decisions about his child's upbringing. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, both parents have the right to be involved in their child's upbringing. However, if one parent is actively undermining the other's decisions, that could be problematic. The father-in-law's actions might be a red line for the author because they violate the prior agreement. The author is concerned about religious indoctrination of a child, which is a sensitive issue.\n\nBut is the author within his rights to threaten divorce over this? If the wife is complicit by allowing her father to take the child, maybe the author feels that his partnership with her is failing. However, using divorce as a threat because of disagreements on child-rearing could be seen as extreme. The wife might be pressured by her family and struggling to balance both sides. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is protecting his child from what he perceives as unwanted influence. If the wife continues to support her family's actions despite the agreement, the author has grounds to feel betrayed. But is threatening divorce the right response? It's a drastic measure, and maybe there are other ways to handle the situation, like legal intervention or counseling.\n\nAnother angle is the father-in-law's actions. If he's taking the child without consent, that could be a legal issue. The author might need to address that through proper channels rather than using divorce threats. However, the author is also the parent, so his rights are significant here.\n\nI think the key is whether the wife is violating their agreement. If she's complicit, then the author's frustration is understandable. But threatening divorce every time there's a disagreement might not be the healthiest approach. However, the situation is complex. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions are proportionate to the situation. Since the father-in-law is acting unilaterally against the father's wishes, and the wife isn't preventing it, the author might feel justified in taking a firm stance. But is he in the wrong for doing so? Maybe not entirely, but it's a close call. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he's protecting his child's upbringing as agreed, but I'm not 100% sure.\n"
