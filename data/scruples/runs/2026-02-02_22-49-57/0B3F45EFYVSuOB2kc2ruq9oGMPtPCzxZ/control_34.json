She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim. \n\nFirst, the setup: The couple married for two years, with the wife from a fundamentalist Muslim immigrant family. The husband is an atheist, and they initially agreed to raise their children secularly. The wife agreed, but her family, especially the father, is pressuring to involve the child in Islam. The husband found out the father took the son to the mosque without consent. The husband is now threatening divorce over this.\n\nKey points to consider: The wife initially agreed to secular upbringing. The husband feels her family is undermining that agreement. The father-in-law's actions (taking the child to the mosque) are a breach of the agreed-upon parenting plan. The husband is frustrated because he's not being heeded by his in-laws and the wife is allowing it.\n\nNow, potential angles of right or wrong. On one hand, the husband has a right to co-parent and ensure his child's upbringing aligns with their agreement. The father-in-law's actions without consent could be seen as overstepping. The husband's threat to divorce is a serious step, but if the wife is enabling her father's actions despite their agreement, maybe that justifies his stance.\n\nOn the other hand, using divorce as a threat might be extreme. The wife might feel pressured or that her autonomy is being infringed. If she's an adult and capable of making her own choices, even if they differ from her husband's, the husband's response could be seen as controlling. Also, the wife's family's disapproval of him and her background as an immigrant might add layers of complexity, but the core issue is about the child's upbringing.\n\nBut the husband's main argument is about the agreed-upon secular upbringing. If the wife is allowing her father to influence the child against their prior agreement, then the husband's frustration is valid. However, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening divorce\u2014might be seen as harsh, but maybe it's his way of standing his ground.\n\nAnother angle: The wife's mental health. She's depressed after seeing her father, indicating pressure from her side. The husband is trying to protect her from that, but maybe he should involve mediation instead of ultimatums. However, the father-in-law's actions are direct violations of their agreement, so the husband's response is about protecting the child's upbringing.\n\nIn family law, parents typically have joint responsibility. If one parent is acting against the agreed plan, the other has a right to object. The husband is asserting his parental rights here. The wife's compliance with her father might be the crux. If the wife is not standing up to her family, maybe she's the one in the wrong here, but the question is about the husband.\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband is trying to enforce their prior agreement regarding their child's upbringing. His threat is a response to a breach of that agreement. Unless there's a legal aspect where he's not following court orders or something, his stance seems justified. Therefore, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
