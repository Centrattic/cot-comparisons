She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with conflicting views on their child's religious upbringing.\n\nThe husband is an atheist, and they had an agreement that their children would be raised secular. The wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family, and there's tension because her family doesn't like the husband. Now, the father-in-law took their son to the mosque without the husband's consent, which violates their agreement. The husband threatens divorce if the wife continues to allow this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple initially agreed on a secular upbringing. The wife's family is pressuring her, and she's struggling. The husband found out about the unauthorized visit to the mosque and is upset. He feels his wishes are being disregarded, and the father-in-law is overstepping.\n\nThe husband's stance is that the son is his too, and he doesn't want his child exposed to the religion against his wishes. The wife, while happy at home, might be under family pressure. The husband is willing to split up over this issue.\n\nNow, determining if the author (the husband) is in the wrong. In many places, both parents have equal rights in their children's upbringing. However, the husband is asserting his right to a secular upbringing. The wife's actions, going against their agreement, could be seen as a breach, but she's also influenced by her family. The husband's threat of divorce is a strong measure, but it's based on a prior agreement.\n\nPossible angles: The husband is standing by his original agreement and protecting his child's upbringing. The wife might be conflicted between her family and her husband. The father-in-law's actions are problematic, but the wife's role in allowing this is key. The husband is not forcing his beliefs but opposing the imposition of another religion against their agreement.\n\nBut does the husband have the right to impose his views through divorce? It depends on the legal framework and the couple's autonomy. In many jurisdictions, both parents can agree on religious upbringing, but if they disagree, it can lead to conflict. The husband's extreme response (divorce) might be seen as harsh, but he's standing by his principles. The wife's actions could be considered a violation of their agreement, so the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, divorce is a major consequence for this issue. The answer might hinge on whether the husband's stance is justified in enforcing the original agreement despite the wife's family influence.\n"
