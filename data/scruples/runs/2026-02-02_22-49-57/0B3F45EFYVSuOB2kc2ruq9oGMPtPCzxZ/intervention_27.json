She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening divorce if his wife continues to raise their son as Muslim. The author is an atheist, the wife is from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their kids secular. The wife's family is pressuring her, and the father-in-law took the son to the mosque without consent.\n\nThe author's main points: they had an agreement before the kids, the in-laws are pressuring them, the father-in-law is acting against the father's wishes, and the author is threatening divorce to prevent the child being raised Muslim. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, legal aspect. In many places, both parents have equal rights to raise their children. If the mother is acting on her own to expose the child to religion, maybe the father can object. But if the mother is being pressured by her family, maybe the father is overstepping by threatening divorce. But the father is also protecting his son from religious indoctrination against his wishes. \n\nEthically, the father's stance is about parental rights. However, threatening divorce because of religious upbringing might be extreme. But the father feels that the agreement was broken, so he's enforcing it. Maybe the wife's actions are a betrayal. However, the father's approach is very harsh\u2014divorce is a serious consequence for a disagreement on child-rearing.\n\nAlso, the father-in-law taking the son without the father's knowledge is a key issue. The father is protecting his son from someone else's influence. The wife might feel torn between her family and her husband. The father's ultimatum might not be fair if the wife isn't directly forcing the religion but is being influenced by her family. \n\nBut the father's main issue is with the grandfather's actions. If the mother is complicit by allowing the grandfather to take the son, then maybe she's violating the agreement. The father's threat of divorce is a reaction to that. However, divorce over this might be too drastic unless there's a legal or ethical violation. \n\nIn terms of rights, if the mother is not directly enforcing the religion but her family is, the father might have a point in objecting. But the father's solution is to end the marriage, which affects the child's life. The wife's autonomy is also a factor. She might be struggling with her own beliefs and family pressure. The father's approach might be seen as controlling or not allowing the wife to make her own decisions once they're married. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's standing by his initial agreement but using divorce as a threat. It's possible he's right in wanting to protect his son's upbringing but wrong in the method. Alternatively, he's correct in enforcing a prior agreement. The answer depends on societal views on parental rights and the severity of the consequence. Maybe B (No) is the answer because he's enforcing a prior agreement, but some might argue A (Yes) because divorce is too harsh. However, given the context of the grandfather's actions and the prior agreement, B seems more likely.\n"
