She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is an atheist married to a Muslim woman who used to be agnostic. They agreed their kids would be raised secularly. Now the wife's family, especially her father, is pressuring to raise their son as Muslim. The father took the kid to the mosque without the author's knowledge. The author is threatening divorce if the wife continues to let this happen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parents had an agreement about secular upbringing. The wife's father is acting against that agreement. The author is upset because the father-in-law is influencing the child without consent, which the author sees as violating their agreement. The wife might be conflicted between her family's expectations and her marriage. \n\nThe author's main concern is about the child's upbringing, which is a big deal in any family. The fact that the father-in-law is taking the child without permission is a breach of trust. But the wife's role is important here. The author is holding her responsible for not stopping her father, but if she's being pressured by her family, maybe she's struggling with that. The author says she's an adult and can do what she wants, but the father-in-law's actions are directly affecting their child. \n\nThe author's threat to divorce is severe. While the father's rights to his child's upbringing are significant, using the threat of divorce over this might be seen as extreme unless there's a legal component. However, if the parents agreed on secular upbringing, the mother taking the child to the mosque without the father's consent could be a breach of that agreement. \n\nBut the mother's autonomy is also a factor. The author might be overstepping if he's not considering her feelings and the pressure she's under from her family. The wife might be caught between her husband and her family, and the author's ultimatum could be causing more stress. \n\nOn the other hand, the father is protecting his child from religious influence that he and his wife agreed not to impose. The father-in-law's actions are unauthorized, which is a problem. The author's stance is about respecting the agreement between the parents. \n\nSo, is he wrong? It depends on how the agreement was made and whether the wife is complicit. If she's not stopping her father despite the author's objections, maybe she's not adhering to the agreement. But if she's being coerced or manipulated by her family, the author might be too harsh. \n\nThe key here is whether the author has a right to control the child's upbringing. In many places, both parents have equal rights, and the author is concerned about the child's exposure to religion against their wishes. However, threatening divorce over this might be a heavy-handed approach. It's possible that the author is not in the wrong because he's standing by his agreement, but his method of handling it could be problematic. Alternatively, the wife's situation is complex, and the author might not be considering her feelings enough.\n\nI think the author is justified in his concerns about his son's upbringing, especially since they had an agreement. However, threatening divorce is a serious consequence. The father-in-law's actions are the initial issue, but the wife's role in allowing it is part of the problem. The author is protecting his child's upbringing, which is valid, but the approach might need to be more collaborative. So, maybe the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his beliefs and the agreement, even if the handling could be better.\n"
