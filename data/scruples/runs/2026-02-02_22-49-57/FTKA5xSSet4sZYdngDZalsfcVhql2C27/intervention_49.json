He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them. The friend doesn't pay bills, groceries, or has a car, so the author covers those. The friend often wants a portion of their meal, and the author sometimes gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might affect the dynamic. The author provides food, but the friend is asking for a share of what the author eats. The key here is whether it's reasonable to expect someone to share their food if they're not contributing to the household expenses.\n\nThe author mentions they ensure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. That suggests they're making an effort to provide, but the friend is still pressuring for their meal. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in seems manipulative. The author is setting boundaries by not always giving in, which could be seen as necessary for their own well-being.\n\nFinancial responsibility: Since the friend isn't paying for groceries, expecting the author to split their meals might be unfair. The author is already covering the costs, so the friend's requests could be considered taking more than their fair share without contributing.\n\nFriendship dynamics: The author is being tolerant of other issues like messiness and noise, but this particular issue might be a boundary they need to enforce. The friend's approach of silent pressure (staring) might be disrespectful. The author's decision to sometimes refuse is a way to maintain their own comfort and autonomy.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong because they're not obligated to share their personal meals, especially when the friend isn't contributing financially. The friend's behavior is more problematic here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
