He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The scenario is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses their car, and sometimes is loud or smelly. The main issue is that the friend keeps asking for a portion of their meal every time they eat, and the writer usually gives in but now is hesitating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a big factor. The writer is shouldering all the costs, which might make sharing food feel like an added burden. The friend's behavior of staring until the writer complies could be seen as pressuring them. That might be manipulative or disrespectful, especially since the writer has already made sure there's food available, even if not the same type. The writer's right to decide how their own food is used is important here. Also, the friend's lack of contribution to the household might justify the writer not sharing their meals. But on the other hand, the writer mentions enduring other less pleasant behaviors for the sake of friendship. However, the core issue is about personal choice and boundaries. The writer isn't obligated to share their food, especially when the friend isn't contributing to the shared living expenses. The friend's expectation might be unreasonable given the imbalance in contributions. So the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
