He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them without paying any bills, doesn't contribute to groceries, and uses the author's car. The friend sometimes acts loud and smelly, but the author puts up with it because they're best friends.\n\nThe main issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author says they ensure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend doesn't directly ask but stares until the author either gives in or not, usually the author does give in. The image link is probably a visual example, but since I can't see it, I'll focus on the text.\n\nFirst, the friend isn't contributing to the household in any way. They don't pay for anything, so it's the author's money that's covering all the expenses. The friend then expects the author to share their personal meals, which the author is making with their own money. That seems like an unfair dynamic. The friend is taking advantage of the author's generosity and the situation they're in.\n\nThe author mentions that they do make sure there's enough food for both, but not the same type. So maybe they're cooking two different meals, but the friend wants the same one. The fact that the friend uses passive-aggressive staring to get what they want instead of directly asking is also a problem. It's manipulative.\n\nHowever, the author and the friend are best friends, and the author is choosing to tolerate the friend's bad habits. This complicates things because there's an emotional bond here. But the friend's behavior seems to be taking advantage of that bond to get what they want without reciprocating. The author is not obligated to share their food, especially since the friend isn't contributing anything. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both parties should contribute or at least communicate their needs. The friend's approach is passive-aggressive and doesn't show respect for the author's autonomy. The author might feel pressured to give in, but that doesn't mean they're wrong for setting boundaries. The friend's lack of contribution to the household makes their request even more questionable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing the food. They have the right to set boundaries, especially when they're the one bearing all the costs.\n"
