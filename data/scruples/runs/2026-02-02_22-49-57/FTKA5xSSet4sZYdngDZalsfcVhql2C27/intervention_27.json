He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend who lives with them.\n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The friend doesn't pay for any bills, groceries, or has a car, so the author covers all the costs. The friend is described as sometimes loud, dirty, and smelly, but the author puts up with it because they're friends. Now, the main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author says they usually give in, but now are questioning if they should have to.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants others' opinions. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nHmm. The key points here are about responsibility and boundaries. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might mean they're not in a position to contribute. The author is providing for their meals, but the friend wants the same type of food each time. However, the author mentions that there's usually enough food for both, just not the same type. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in seems manipulative or passive-aggressive.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the author is already covering all the costs, including groceries, it's reasonable that they have control over their own meals. The friend's expectation to get a portion of every meal might be crossing a line, especially if the author isn't required to share. The author setting boundaries here could be appropriate. The friend's lack of financial contribution might make it even more about the author's right to manage their own resources without being coerced.\n\nHowever, some might argue that since they're friends and living together, there's an unspoken agreement to share. But given the friend isn't contributing, it's a one-sided arrangement. The author is already making sacrifices in other areas (putting up with the friend's habits), so not sharing food might be a necessary boundary. The picture (even though we can't see it) might show the situation where the author is eating something the friend doesn't have, but the author is covering all the costs, so they shouldn't have to share beyond what they've already provided.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. The friend's behavior is more problematic because they aren't contributing and are being passive-aggressive. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially when they're shouldering all the responsibilities. So the answer would be B.\n"
