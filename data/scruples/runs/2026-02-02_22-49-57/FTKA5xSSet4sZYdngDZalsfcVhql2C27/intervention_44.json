He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses their car, and sometimes is loud or dirty. However, the main issue is that the friend takes portions of the author's meals without being asked.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is providing for the friend's basic needs\u2014food, shelter, transportation. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a point of contention. Now, the friend is taking food from the author's plate, which the author doesn't want. The author mentions that they usually give in but sometimes don't. The friend's behavior here is passive-aggressive, staring until they get the food. \n\nIs it fair for the author to not share? Well, the author is making sure there's enough food for both, but the friend is taking from the author's specific meal. If there's enough food available that isn't part of the author's meal, maybe the friend could take from that. But if the friend is taking from what the author prepared for themselves, that's different. The author has the right to their own meal, especially if they're not the one paying for it. \n\nThe friend's lack of contribution is a red flag. The author is shouldering all responsibilities, which might be leading to resentment. The friend's behavior of staring to get food is manipulative. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here. They can choose not to share their meal without it being an issue, especially since they're not the ones paying for it. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have communicated better. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for the act of not sharing. Given that the friend isn't contributing and is taking from the author's meal without explicit consent, the author isn't at fault. The real problem is the imbalance in their living arrangement, but the specific act of not sharing the meal isn't wrong.\n"
