He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about sharing food with a best friend who lives together but doesn't contribute to the bills or groceries. The friend ends up wanting a portion of the author's meal every time, and the author usually gives in after being stared at.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the friend doesn't pay for anything and lives for free. So, the author is covering all the expenses, including groceries. They also take the friend everywhere because he doesn't have a car. The friend has some other issues like being loud, dirty, and smelly, but the author tolerates it because they're friends. \n\nNow, the main issue is the food sharing. The friend doesn't have food of his own, but the author makes sure there's enough for both, even if it's not the same type. The friend uses a stare to pressure the author into sharing, and the author usually gives in. \n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong for not sharing. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. \n\nI need to assess if the friend's request is reasonable. Since the author is paying for groceries, it's their money and their food. The friend isn't contributing, so expecting the author to share every meal might be unfair. However, the author does make sure there's enough food, so maybe they are trying to be considerate. The friend's method of asking (staring until the author gives in) is passive-aggressive and could be seen as manipulative. \n\nThe author's responsibility isn't to provide every meal they eat. It's about mutual respect and understanding. The friend's behavior might be taking advantage of the author's kindness. The fact that the friend has his own food, but still wants the same type as the author, might not be a valid reason for the author to share. \n\nSo, considering the friend isn't contributing and uses pressure tactics, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing. The author is setting boundaries, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
