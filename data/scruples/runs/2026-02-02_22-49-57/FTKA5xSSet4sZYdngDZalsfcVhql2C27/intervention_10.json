He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me break this down. The person is living with their best friend who doesn't pay rent, bills, or groceries. The friend relies on them for transportation and sometimes acts messy or loud. Now, the issue is that the friend wants a portion of every meal the author eats, even though there's already enough food for both, just not the exact same type. The author usually gives in when the friend stares at them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend isn't contributing financially and is taking resources without paying. The author is making sure there's enough food, but the friend is asking for a share of each meal. The key point here is that the friend isn't cooking their own food or contributing to the meal, just taking from what the author prepares. Even though there's enough food in quantity, the type might differ, but the friend is expecting the same meal.\n\nThe author is feeling pressured to share every meal, which might be leading to resentment. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in suggests manipulation. The author's right to their own meals without being coerced is important. Since the friend isn't contributing to the meals, expecting a portion of every meal they prepare isn't fair. The author isn't in the wrong for not sharing, especially since they're already providing enough food. They're setting boundaries, which is necessary here. So the answer is B.\n"
