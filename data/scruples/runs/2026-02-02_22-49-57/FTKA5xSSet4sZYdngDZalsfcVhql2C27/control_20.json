He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or messy. The main issue is the friend taking a portion of the author's meal each time they eat, often by staring until the author complies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend is not contributing financially, which might already be a point of contention. The author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. So maybe the friend is not eating what's available but instead taking from the author's meal. That could be seen as taking without contributing, which isn't fair. \n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in seems like a form of pressure. The author is in a position where they might feel obligated to share because of their friendship and the friend's free stay. However, personal boundaries are important. If the author is uncomfortable with this dynamic, they have the right to set limits. \n\nThe key here is whether the friend is actually in a position to demand food. Since the friend is not paying for groceries, it's possible that the author is already covering all the costs, so the friend's constant taking could be seen as unfair. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to keep their food for themselves, especially when they're the one providing everything else. \n\nBut maybe the friend is just used to sharing because of their friendship. However, if it's a one-sided arrangement where the friend isn't contributing, then the author's reluctance to share makes sense. The friend's actions might be crossing a line by using passive aggression (staring) to get what they want. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to their own food, especially given the friend's lack of contribution. The friend's behavior is more problematic because they're taking advantage of the situation. So the answer should be B.\n"
