He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, relies on the author for transportation, and often asks for a portion of the author's meals. The author makes sure there's enough food for both, but the friend just stares until they give in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend isn't contributing financially to the shared living expenses. That's a significant point. If someone is living for free, including not paying for groceries, it's reasonable to expect that they should manage their own meals or that the arrangement is discussed upfront. However, the author mentions that they always ensure there's enough food for both, which suggests they might already be providing for the friend's meals in some capacity, even if not the same type.\n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in could be seen as manipulative or pressuring. The author is setting boundaries by not sharing when they choose, which might be necessary for their own well-being. On the other hand, if the friend is genuinely in need and the author is capable, there might be an expectation of support. But given the friend's lack of contribution to the household, the author's refusal isn't necessarily wrong. They have the right to set limits, especially since they're covering all the expenses. The key here is mutual respect and clear communication. If the friend is being asked to take responsibility for their own meals but continues to pressure the author, then the author is justified in not sharing. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
