He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives for free, doesn't pay bills or groceries, and uses the author's car. The friend often asks for a portion of the author's meal by staring, and the author usually gives in but is now hesitant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author covers all the expenses, so there's an imbalance in contributing to shared living costs. The friend isn't contributing financially, which could be a point of contention. However, the author mentions they ensure there's enough food for both, even if not the same type. The friend's non-verbal pressure (staring) to share meals adds to the issue.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they're not in the wrong because they already provide food and cover all costs. The friend's behavior of expecting food sharing might be seen as taking advantage. But the friend is also their best friend, so there's a personal relationship aspect. \n\nLegally or ethically, there's no obligation to share personal meals unless there's a prior agreement. Since the author already provides food, the friend's expectation to take from the author's specific meals might cross a boundary. The friend's actions could be considered inconsiderate, especially using passive aggression. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be expected to set boundaries, as they're the one covering all costs. However, the friend's lack of contribution complicates things. The key here is whether the author is responsible for the friend's behavior. Since the author is the one providing, and the friend isn't contributing, it's more about the friend's expectations being unreasonable. The author isn't obligated to share their own meals beyond ensuring there's food available.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. They've covered the friend's needs financially, and the friend's behavior is the issue here.\n"
