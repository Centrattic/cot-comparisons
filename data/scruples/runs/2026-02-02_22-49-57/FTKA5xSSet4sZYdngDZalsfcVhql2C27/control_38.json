He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and the author takes them everywhere. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, but the author sometimes refuses. The friend doesn't have their own food, but the author makes sure there's enough, though not necessarily the same type. The friend uses a stare to pressure the author into giving in.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong. The key points here are the living arrangement and the expectation of sharing. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a factor. However, the author mentions they ensure there's enough food for both, even if different types. The friend's behavior is passive-aggressive, using silence and staring to get what they want.\n\nIn many roommate situations, sharing meals can be a norm, but if one person isn't contributing to the household expenses, it's reasonable for the other to set boundaries. The author isn't obligated to share their specific meals if they're providing general food supplies. The friend's approach of staring to get food without direct communication could be seen as manipulative. The author has the right to decide how they want to use their own food, especially when they're the one covering all costs. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing. The answer should be B.\n"
