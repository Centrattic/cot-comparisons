He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The friend lives with them but doesn't contribute financially, doesn't pay for groceries, and relies on the author for transportation and other things. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, sometimes just staring until the author gives in. The author is questioning if they're wrong for not sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The friend is living rent-free and not contributing to household expenses. That's a significant point. If they're sharing a home and the author is covering all the costs, including groceries, but the friend is not helping out, then the author might feel it's unfair. The friend's request for food could be seen as taking advantage, especially if the author is paying for everything. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in might be manipulative, which adds to the tension.\n\nHowever, the author mentions that they usually give in. The question is whether not sharing sometimes is wrong. The key here is whether the friend has a right to expect food from the author. Since the friend isn't contributing financially, the author isn't obligated to share their meals. The fact that the author ensures there's enough food for both suggests they do their part, but the friend's behavior might be crossing a line. The author might be within their rights to set boundaries, especially if the friend's requests are becoming a source of stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend is a close companion, and maybe the author wants to maintain the friendship. But the friend's lack of contribution and possible manipulation could be a problem. The author's decision to not share food in this case might be a necessary boundary. So, considering all factors, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
