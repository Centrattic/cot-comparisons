He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their best friend live together. The friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and the author covers all expenses. The friend also uses the author's car. So, the main point here is the financial responsibility. The author is taking care of everything, which might be a source of tension. \n\nThe friend doesn't outright ask for food but instead stares until the author gives in. The author mentions they usually do give in but now are questioning if they're wrong for not sharing. The picture shows the friend taking a portion of the author's meal, implying this is a recurring issue. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are the living arrangement, financial contributions, and the friend's behavior. The author is providing for the friend's basic needs but the friend isn't contributing. The friend's actions of staring and taking food without being asked might be seen as taking advantage. \n\nIn terms of social norms, if someone is living with you and not contributing, they might expect you to cover their needs. However, the author is setting boundaries by not always sharing their specific meals. The friend's expectation to get a portion every time could be unreasonable, especially since the author is already handling all the costs. \n\nThe author's stress about the situation shows that their boundaries are being tested. The friend's behavior, whether loud, dirty, or smelly, isn't justified, but the author is willing to tolerate it. However, the food sharing part might be a different matter. If the author is providing enough food overall, the friend shouldn't need to take portions from the author's plate. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they are already fulfilling their part by ensuring there's enough food. The friend's actions are the issue here, as they're not contributing and are pressuring the author for more. The answer should be B, No.\n"
