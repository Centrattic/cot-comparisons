He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and uses the author's car. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, staring until they give in. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both but not the same type. The user thinks the author isn't wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The key points are financial responsibility and mutual respect. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a big factor. If they're roommates, splitting costs is usually expected. The fact that the author covers all expenses might mean the friend relies on them, but the question is about the food sharing.\n\nThe friend demands food by staring, which is pressuring the author. The author mentions they make sure there's enough food, but maybe not the same type. So if the author is buying enough food in general, but the friend expects the same specific meal, that's different. The author isn't obligated to share their personal meal portions, especially if they prepared it themselves. The friend's behavior of staring to get food could be seen as manipulative or inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, the author is putting up with other issues like loudness and smell. They might feel they're being unfair if they say no to food sharing. But the friend's lack of contribution complicates things. If the friend isn't paying, maybe they should cover their own meals. The author's provision of food might be out of friendship, but the friend's demand could be crossing a line. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially if they're not in a relationship where sharing is expected equally.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily wrong for not sharing their specific meals if they've already ensured there's food available. The friend's behavior might be the issue here, pressuring for more. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
