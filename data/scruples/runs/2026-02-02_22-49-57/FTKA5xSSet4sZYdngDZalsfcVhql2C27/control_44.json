He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The setup is that they live together, the friend doesn't contribute to bills or groceries, uses their car, and sometimes is loud, dirty, and smelly. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of their meals, but they don't always give them the same type of food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't paying for anything, which might indicate that the writer is shouldering all the costs. If the friend is living there for free, it's possible that the writer feels taken advantage of already. The friend's behavior of not contributing could be adding to the writer's stress, especially regarding food. The friend's habit of staring until the writer gives in suggests that the friend is pressuring the writer, which isn't respectful. \n\nNow, the food sharing part. The writer mentions that they ensure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. So maybe they buy different meals, but the friend expects them to share. If the meals are separate and the friend is taking from the writer's portion without consent, that's an issue. The writer is being asked to share their personal meal, which they might not be comfortable with. However, the friend's justification might be that they are sharing a home and resources, so they expect sharing of food as well. \n\nBut the key here is consent and boundaries. If the writer hasn't agreed to share their meals, then the friend's actions are overstepping. Also, since the friend isn't contributing financially, the writer might feel it's unfair to have to share their food. The fact that the friend uses the writer's car and doesn't pay bills adds to the imbalance. The writer might be setting boundaries by not sharing their meal, which is their right. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend is in need or has dietary restrictions, the situation might be different. But there's no mention of that here. The friend's behavior of staring until the writer complies is manipulative. The writer is being assertive by not giving in every time. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while sharing food can be a kind gesture, it's not a requirement. People have the right to their own meals, especially if they paid for them. The fact that the friend is taking without asking directly might be the issue. The writer is protecting their own portion, which isn't wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the writer isn't in the wrong for not sharing their food. The friend is overstepping boundaries, and the writer is asserting their right to their own meal. The underlying issues with the friend not contributing to expenses might be contributing to the tension, but the specific act of not sharing food isn't the writer's fault. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
