He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or contribute to groceries, but the author still takes them places and puts up with their habits. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, and the author sometimes gives in but sometimes doesn't. The friend doesn't outright ask but stares until the author complies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, so the author is covering all costs. The friend is taking food without paying, which is a resource the author is responsible for. The friend's behavior of staring until they get food could be seen as manipulative or pressuring. The author is trying to manage their own meals and resources, so not wanting to share might be seen as reasonable if the friend isn't contributing. However, the author mentions they usually give in, so they might feel conflicted.\n\nOn the other hand, if the friend isn't having their own meals, maybe the author isn't providing enough. But the author says they make sure there's enough food, just not the same type. Maybe the meals the author makes are specific to their own preferences, and the friend is taking from that. If the author isn't okay with sharing, then it's their right to not share their own food, especially if the friend is not contributing. The friend's behavior of staring and pressuring might be the problem here.\n\nSo, the key points are: the friend isn't contributing, the author is covering all costs, the friend is pressuring for food they didn't pay for. The author is within their rights to not share, as they're the one paying for the groceries. The friend's actions are more questionable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
