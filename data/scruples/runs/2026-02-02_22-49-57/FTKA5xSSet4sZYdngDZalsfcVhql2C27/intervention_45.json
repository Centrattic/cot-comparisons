He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them but doesn't pay bills or groceries. The friend often asks for a portion of their meal, sometimes by staring, and the author usually gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend doesn't contribute financially, lives for free, and uses the author's car. The main issue is the food sharing. The author feels it's unfair to have to share their food all the time, even though they make sure there's enough for both. The friend doesn't directly ask but uses passive pressure like staring.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know others' opinions. The answer options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nI need to consider the fairness here. If the friend isn't contributing financially, is it reasonable to expect the author to share their meals? The author is covering all expenses, so asking for a portion might be seen as taking advantage. Also, the friend's method of staring to get what they want is manipulative. The author has a right to their own food, especially when they're the one paying for it.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe they're close friends, and sharing meals is part of their relationship. However, the friend's lack of contribution in other areas might tip the balance. The author is already doing a lot for the friend, and the food issue is another point where the friend isn't pulling their weight. The author's choice to sometimes give in might be out of kindness, but it's not their obligation. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries around their food, especially when the friend isn't contributing to the household costs. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
