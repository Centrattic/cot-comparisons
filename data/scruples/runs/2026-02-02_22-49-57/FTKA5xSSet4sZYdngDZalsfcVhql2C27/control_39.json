He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the author provides food but the friend expects a portion every time. The friend uses passive pressure, like staring, to get the food.\n\nFirst, the living arrangement is a key point. The friend isn't contributing financially, which the author mentions they tolerate for being best friends. But when it comes to food, the friend wants a share without contributing. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in is passive-aggressive.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics, the author might feel they're being taken advantage of. They're covering all expenses and the friend isn't contributing. The food sharing might be seen as part of the living costs if they're splitting bills, but in this case, the friend isn't paying anything. So maybe the author isn't obligated to share food if the friend isn't contributing. However, the author does make an effort to have enough food, which could imply some expectation of sharing.\n\nBut the friend's method of getting the food is problematic. Passive pressure tactics like staring without direct communication can be manipulative. The author might be within their rights to say no if they're not comfortable. The friend's behavior might be the issue here, not the author's refusal.\n\nAnother angle: if the author is making meals for themselves and the friend isn't part of the meal preparation, the friend might not have a right to expect a share. The fact that the friend doesn't pay for groceries or bills might mean they shouldn't expect to eat what the author cooks. However, the author does ensure there's enough food, which could be seen as a goodwill gesture, but that doesn't necessarily mean the friend can just take it.\n\nAlso, the living arrangement as described is unequal. The author is taking care of everything, and the friend is not contributing. The food sharing might be part of that imbalance. The author's refusal isn't in the wrong if the friend isn't contributing in return. The friend might need to either pay for their share or stop expecting food.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing food since the friend isn't contributing financially. The problem lies with the friend's expectations and behavior, not the author's refusal. So the answer is B.\n"
