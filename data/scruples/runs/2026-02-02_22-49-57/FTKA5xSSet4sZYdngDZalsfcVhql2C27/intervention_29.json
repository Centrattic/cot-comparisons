He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend lives with the author but doesn't pay any bills or contribute to groceries. The author takes them everywhere since the friend doesn't have a car. Despite the friend's loudness, messiness, and smell, the author puts up with it because they're best friends. Now, the issue is that whenever the author eats, the friend wants a portion. The author makes sure there's enough food for both, though not always the same type. The friend doesn't outright ask but stares until the author gives in or not.\n\nThe author is saying they're not in the wrong, but they want opinions. The user is asking if the author is wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nHmm. The key points here are the living arrangement and the responsibilities. The friend isn't contributing financially, so the author is covering all expenses, including groceries. If the author is already ensuring there's enough food for both, the friend's demand for a portion of the same meal might not be fair, especially if the author is eating something different. The friend's passive-aggressive behavior (staring) could be pushing the author into a position of having to comply without a real request. \n\nBut maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're already providing enough food. Sharing a meal is different from ensuring there's food available. The friend's entitlement to the same meal might not be justified, especially since they don't contribute. However, the fact that they're best friends might imply some level of mutual support, but the friend isn't pulling their weight in other areas. \n\nThe author could argue that they're being respectful by ensuring there's food, but the friend's behavior is crossing a line by expecting a share of the meal. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong for setting boundaries here. The friend's actions are more problematic. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
