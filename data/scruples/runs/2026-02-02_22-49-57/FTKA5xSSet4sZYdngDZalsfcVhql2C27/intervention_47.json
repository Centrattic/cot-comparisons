He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them. The situation is that the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or smelly. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, staring until the author gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is covering all the expenses, including groceries, and the friend isn't contributing financially. The friend's behavior of asking for food, especially non-verbally, might be seen as taking advantage. The author is setting boundaries by not sharing, especially since they're responsible for their own meals.\n\nBut the friend is also described as the author's best friend, so there's a personal relationship aspect. The friend isn't outright stealing but using subtle pressure. The user believes the author isn't wrong, but others might argue that it's about mutual respect and shared living arrangements. However, given the friend's lack of contribution, the author's decision to not share might be justified. The key points are financial responsibility and the imbalance in contributions. So the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
