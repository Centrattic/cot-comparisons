He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves two roommates who are best friends. The key points are that the friend doesn't pay rent or groceries, uses the author's car, and often expects food portions from the author's meals. The author sometimes gives in to the friend's unspoken demands.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is already a significant issue. Sharing a home without splitting costs can create tension. The author mentions dealing with the friend's loudness, messiness, and smell, which they tolerate for their friendship. But the main conflict here is about food sharing.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in sounds like emotional pressure. The author is setting boundaries by not always giving in, but the friend is expecting food without contributing. Legally and ethically, you're not obligated to share your personal meal with someone, especially if you've already made sure there's enough food available. However, the friend's lack of financial contribution complicates things. \n\nThe author ensures there's enough food for both, but the friend might be relying on the author's meals instead of using the available food. The act of making separate meals each time isn't necessary if there's already shared food. The friend's non-verbal pressure tactics (staring) could be seen as manipulative. The author isn't wrong for not giving in when they choose to, especially since the friend isn't contributing to the household. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a communication issue. If the friend has needs or preferences, they should express them directly instead of using passive-aggressive methods. The author's stance is reasonable because they're maintaining their own boundaries in a situation where they're already accommodating multiple issues without reciprocity. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
