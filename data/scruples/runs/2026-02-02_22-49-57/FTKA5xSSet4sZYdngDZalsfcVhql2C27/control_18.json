He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them. Let me break this down. The friend doesn't pay any bills, groceries, or has a car, and the author takes them everywhere. The friend sometimes wants a portion of the author's meal, and the author usually gives in after a stare. The picture isn't visible, but maybe it shows the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The author provides a home, transportation, and groceries. That's a significant contribution. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a point of contention. However, the author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both but not always the same type. So, maybe the author is providing food, but the friend is wanting to take from the author's specific meal instead of using the available food.\n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in could be seen as manipulative or pressuring. The author might be feeling that their personal choice to eat their own meal is being infringed upon. But the friend isn't explicitly asking, just implying. The question is about sharing food when the author is eating. If the author has already ensured there's enough food for both, maybe the friend should take from the shared supplies rather than the author's portion. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might be in a situation where they don't have enough on their own, but the author says they make sure there's enough. So if the friend is asking again for the author's specific meal, that could be overstepping. The author is setting boundaries by not always giving in. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't obligated to share their personal meal. The friend's living situation is being supported by the author, but that doesn't automatically mean the author has to give up their own food. The friend's passive aggressive approach (staring) might be part of the issue. The author is putting up with other things like noise and mess, but this is about personal choice during a meal. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here because they are respecting their own meal while ensuring there's enough for the friend. The friend should be using the shared food instead of trying to take from what the author is eating. The author's \"no\" is their right, especially if they've already provided sufficient food.\n"
