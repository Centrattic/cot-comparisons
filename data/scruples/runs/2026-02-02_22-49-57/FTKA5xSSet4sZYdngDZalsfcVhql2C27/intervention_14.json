He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the friend often asks for a portion of their meal, usually getting it after some staring.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and their friend are roommates, but the friend isn't contributing financially. The friend is loud, dirty, and smelly, but the author puts up with it for the friendship. The main issue is about sharing food. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but maybe not the same type. The friend doesn't directly ask but uses passive-aggressive staring. The author usually gives in, but the question is whether not sharing is wrong.\n\nSo, the author might feel it's unfair because the friend doesn't pay for groceries. If the friend is getting their own food, maybe they should take their own portions. But the author mentions that they often give in, which could lead to resentment. The friend's behavior of staring instead of asking is a problem, but the question is about the author's responsibility to share.\n\nIn a typical roommate setup, splitting costs is part of the agreement. If the friend isn't contributing, the author might not be obligated to share their meals. However, since they are best friends, maybe there's an expectation of sharing. But the friend isn't even paying for their share of the food. The author's responsibility is limited to what they can provide, and if they already ensure there's enough for both, the friend should take their own. Also, the friend's method of asking (staring) is not respectful. So the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing, especially if the friend isn't contributing. The right answer is B.\n"
