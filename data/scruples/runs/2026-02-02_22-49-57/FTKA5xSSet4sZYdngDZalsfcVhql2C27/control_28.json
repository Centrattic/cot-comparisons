He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and relies on the author for transportation. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, and the author sometimes gives in but not always.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a point of contention. The author is covering all the costs, so perhaps they feel it's unfair to have to share their own food. On the other hand, the friend might see the food as a communal resource since they're living together. However, the author mentions that they make sure there's enough food for both, even if not the same type. So they're providing, but the friend is taking from the author's specific meal.\n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in could be seen as pressuring. That's a form of passive aggression, which isn't healthy. The author is setting boundaries by sometimes saying no, which seems reasonable. If the author made food specifically for themselves, they have the right to not share it. The friend's lack of contribution might also justify the author not feeling obligated to share. \n\nBut maybe the author is being a bit selfish? However, considering the friend isn't contributing financially, the author's stance could be justified. The key here is that the author is providing food already, so they aren't withholding entirely. The issue is about personal portions. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing their own meal when they've already ensured the friend has food available. The friend's behavior might need addressing, but the author's decision to not share every meal isn't wrong.\n"
