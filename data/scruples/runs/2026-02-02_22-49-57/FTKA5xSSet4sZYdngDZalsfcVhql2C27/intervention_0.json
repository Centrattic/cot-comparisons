He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author and their best friend live together. The friend doesn't pay any bills, doesn't contribute to groceries, and relies on the author for transportation. The author mentions putting up with the friend's loudness, messiness, and bad smell because they're best friends. Now the main issue is that the friend often wants a portion of the author's meal whenever they eat. The friend doesn't explicitly ask but stares until the author gives in. The author sometimes does, sometimes doesn't. The image provided (assuming it's a picture of someone eating alone while the friend is looking on) probably shows the situation.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The answer should be A or B.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Let's consider the details. The friend isn't contributing financially, so the author is covering all living expenses and groceries. The friend is making demands through passive-aggressive behavior (staring) to get food. The author feels pressured to share but isn't doing it all the time. The key points here are consent and boundaries. The author is not obligated to share their food if they didn't agree to it. The friend's behavior, however, is manipulative, which is on the friend, not the author.\n\nThe author is maintaining boundaries by sometimes not giving in. Since the friend isn't contributing, the author isn't responsible for the friend's meals beyond providing common groceries. The friend's passive-aggressive tactics are the problem, not the author's refusal to share every time. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries, even in a friendship.\n"
