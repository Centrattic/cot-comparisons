He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills, doesn't have a car, and uses the author's resources to get around. The friend is sometimes loud, dirty, and smelly, but the author puts up with it because they're friends.\n\nThe main issue is the food sharing. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend doesn't ask, just stares until the author gives in or not. The author usually gives in, but now the friend is pushing for a portion every time. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to decide if the author is wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the friend isn't contributing financially. That's a big point. If someone is living with you and not paying for anything, including food, it's reasonable to expect them to contribute or at least not take without asking. The author is providing food, but the friend is taking a portion without permission. That seems like taking advantage. \n\nThe friend's behavior\u2014staring until the author gives in\u2014sounds manipulative. The author has the right to decide how to use their own food, especially since they're the one paying for it. Even if the author usually gives in, that doesn't mean it's okay for the friend to continue doing this. \n\nAlso, the fact that the friend doesn't have a car and the author takes them around adds to the imbalance. The author is providing multiple supports, but the friend isn't contributing back, especially in terms of financial responsibility. \n\nHowever, the author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both. So maybe the friend isn't going hungry, but the issue is the expectation of sharing the same type of meal. If the author is cooking something specific and the friend wants a portion, that's different from having their own food. \n\nThe key here is consent. The friend isn't asking, just taking. Even if the author usually gives in, the act of taking without permission is problematic. The author has the right to say no. The friend's behavior might be habitual, but the author isn't obligated to share every meal. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is covering all the costs, so expecting the friend to either contribute financially or ask before taking makes sense. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their right to not share food when they don't want to. The friend's actions are more disrespectful. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're not obligated to share every meal without the friend contributing. The friend's behavior is taking advantage, not the author's refusal to share when they choose not to.\n"
