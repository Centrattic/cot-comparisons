He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them for free. The friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, uses the author's car, can be loud and smelly, but the author puts up with it because they're friends.\n\nSo the main issue here is the food sharing. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend just stares until the author gives in. The question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing.\n\nHmm. Well, the author isn't obligated to share their personal meals. If the author is making separate meals, like in the picture linked (though I can't see the image), maybe they're having different foods. The friend is supposed to have his own food, but he's taking from the author's. The author is saying they provide enough for both, so maybe the friend isn't starving. But the friend's behavior of staring and expecting a portion might be pushy.\n\nThe key points are: the friend doesn't contribute financially, but the author is allowing him to stay. The food issue is the conflict. The author is not wrong if they're not being unreasonable. If the author is cooking for themselves, it's their choice to share or not. The friend's actions of staring and pressuring might be the problem here. So the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong because they're not required to share their meals. The friend's behavior is more at fault here.\n"
