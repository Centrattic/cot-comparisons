He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or smelly. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author usually gives in but is now questioning if they should continue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, which could be a red flag. If the author is covering all the costs, it's reasonable for them to expect some boundaries. The friend's behavior of staring until the author complies sounds manipulative or passive-aggressive. The author is putting up with a lot already, so not wanting to share food might be a reasonable boundary.\n\nHowever, the author mentions they ensure there's enough food for both, just not the same type. Maybe the friend isn't getting the specific meal the author is having, but there's other food available. The friend's entitlement to the author's personal meal could be an issue. The author has the right to their own food without pressure. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that since they live together, sharing resources is expected. But the friend isn't contributing, so that balance is off. The author isn't obligated to share their individual meals. The key here is whether the friend is actually in need (the author says they have food) versus being inconsiderate. Since the author is already doing a lot for the friend, setting a boundary around their own food isn't unreasonable. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B). They have the right to set boundaries, especially when the friend isn't contributing and is already receiving a lot of support.\n"
