He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The scenario is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries and uses their car. The friend often wants a portion of their meals, and the author sometimes gives in but not always. The friend doesn't have food, but the author says there's enough, just not the same type.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. Since the friend isn't contributing financially, that's a red flag. Living with someone without paying rent or bills is a big deal. The author is shouldering all the costs, which could lead to tension. Then, the friend expects food sharing. The author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, but it's not always the same. The friend uses passive-aggressive tactics like staring to get their way. The author sometimes gives in, but when they don't, the friend might be upset.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, sharing food is a personal choice. The author is providing enough food for both, so maybe the friend's expectation isn't being met. However, the friend's behavior of staring to pressure the author isn't healthy. The main issue is the unequal financial responsibility. If the author is providing groceries, then making sure there's enough for both is their right. The friend expecting to eat the same food might be unrealistic if the author is making different meals. The key here is the friend's lack of contribution and the pressure tactics. The author isn't obligated to share their specific meals if there's already food available. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
