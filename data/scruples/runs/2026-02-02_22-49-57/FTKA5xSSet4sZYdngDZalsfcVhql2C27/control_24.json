He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them but doesn't pay bills or groceries. The friend is loud, messy, and smelly, but the author puts up with it because they're friends. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, and the author usually gives in unless they refuse. Now, the author is considering not sharing and is asking if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. First, the friend isn't contributing financially, which is a big point. The author covers bills, groceries, and even transportation. So the friend isn't paying their share, which might be an issue. But the author still provides enough food for both of them, just maybe not the same type. The problem arises when the friend wants a portion of the author's specific meal. The author is torn between their friend's requests and their own boundaries.\n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until they get what they want isn't great. It's passive-aggressive and could be seen as manipulative. The author is trying to set boundaries here by sometimes refusing. Since the friend is already receiving enough food from the groceries the author buys, maybe the author isn't obligated to share their specific meals. The author is maintaining their own space and not allowing the friend to push them into sharing every time. Considering the friend isn't contributing their share, the author's stance might be reasonable. So, the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
