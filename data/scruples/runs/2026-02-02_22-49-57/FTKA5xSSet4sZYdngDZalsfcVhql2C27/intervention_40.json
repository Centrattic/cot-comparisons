He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. They live together, but the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, just lives there for free. The friend also doesn't have a car, so the author takes them everywhere. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meals each time, sometimes just staring until the author gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. If the friend isn't contributing financially, that's already a point in the author's favor. They're shouldering all the expenses. Then there's the food situation. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend is asking for a portion, but the author isn't obligated to share their specific meals, especially if they've already ensured there's enough in the house. Forcing someone to share their personal meal when they've already provided for the other person's basic needs seems unreasonable.\n\nThe friend's behavior of just staring until the author gives in is passive-aggressive. It's not a direct request, which could be seen as manipulative. The author has the right to eat what they prepare without being coerced. The fact that the friend is loud, dirty, and smelly adds context about the living situation, showing the author is already tolerating a lot. The friend's lack of contribution makes the sharing issue even more one-sided.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the author is already providing food for both, the friend should be content with their own share. The author isn't at fault for setting boundaries around their own meals. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
