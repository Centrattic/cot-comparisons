He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and uses their car. The friend often asks for a portion of their meals, sometimes by staring, and the author usually gives in. Now they're not sharing and are being questioned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which already sets up a power imbalance. The author is covering all expenses, which might lead to feelings of being taken advantage of. When it comes to sharing food, even though there's enough, the friend expects a portion. The author is now resisting, which is the crux of the issue.\n\nIs it fair for the friend to expect shared food without contributing? Probably not. If the author is providing food as part of their arrangement, maybe they have the right to decide how to consume it. The friend using passive-aggressive tactics (staring) to get food might be manipulative. The author might feel that their autonomy over their own meal is being violated, especially since the friend isn't contributing. \n\nBut on the other hand, living together often involves compromises. Maybe the author expected some level of sharing when they agreed to the arrangement. However, since the friend isn't paying for anything, it's a one-sided agreement. The author isn't obligated to share their personal meal choices. The friend's behavior of expecting a portion without contributing could be seen as exploitative.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing. Since the friend isn't contributing, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for asserting their right to their own food. The friend's demands might be unreasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
