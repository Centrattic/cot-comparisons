He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The friend doesn't pay any bills, doesn't contribute to groceries, and the author is the one covering everything. The friend lives there for free, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or dirty. Now, whenever the author eats, the friend wants a portion, and the author usually gives in but is now questioning if they should continue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The friend isn't contributing financially. The author is the one paying for everything, including groceries. So, if the author is making sure there's enough food for both, but the friend is expecting to eat what the author is eating, even though they could have their own meals. The friend's behavior is passive-aggressive, staring until the author gives in. \n\nThe author is being taken advantage of. They're doing everything except setting boundaries. The friend's actions are taking more than their share without contributing. Even though the author ensures there's food, the friend is making a demand through non-verbal cues. The author's problem is that they're giving in despite not having any obligation. The friend's lack of contribution makes it even worse. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their own meals. The friend is the one being inconsiderate. The answer should be B, No.\n"
