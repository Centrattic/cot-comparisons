He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they live with their best friend who doesn't pay any bills, doesn't pay for groceries, and relies on the author for transportation. The friend keeps asking for a portion of the author's meals every time they eat. The author usually gives in after the friend stares at them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be an issue. But the author mentions that they make sure there's enough food for both, just not always the same type. So maybe the author is providing food in general, but the friend is taking from the author's specific meal. \n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in sounds like a form of passive pressure. The author is being asked to share their personal meal, not just the available food. The friend isn't outright asking, which could make the situation awkward. The author might feel obligated even if they don't want to. \n\nIs the author responsible for sharing their own food? If the author has their own meal, they might not have an obligation to give a portion away unless it's a shared meal. The friend's expectation of automatically getting part of the author's meal could be unreasonable. \n\nAlso, considering the friend's lack of contribution to expenses, maybe the author is overextending by consistently giving in. The author mentions putting up with other issues like noise and smell, so the meal sharing might be another boundary that's being crossed without consent. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing their own meal. They have the right to their own food, and the friend's behavior is more about taking without clear consent. The friend's actions, like staring to pressure, might be the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
