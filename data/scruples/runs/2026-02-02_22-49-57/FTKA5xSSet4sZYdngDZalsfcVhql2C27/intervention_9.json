He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe friend lives with the author but doesn't pay any bills or groceries. The author covers all the costs, transports the friend, and puts up with other issues like noise and mess. The problem is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The friend doesn't outright ask but gives a stare, and the author usually gives in.\n\nSo, the key points here are the living arrangement, financial responsibilities, and the food-sharing expectation. The author is making sure there's enough food for both, but it's not the same type. The friend's behavior seems to be passive-aggressive, using the stare to get what they want.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is already shouldering all the financial and logistical responsibilities. The friend's expectation to share every meal, especially when they don't contribute, could be seen as taking advantage. The author is not obligated to share their personal meal, even if there's food in the house. The friend's method of pressuring through a stare is also inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, the author is the one who usually gives in, which might indicate that they feel some obligation. But since the friend isn't contributing, it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries. The fact that there's always enough food means the friend isn't going hungry. The author's right to choose what they eat should be respected, and the friend's behavior is more about control.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they're not responsible for the friend's expectations. The friend is the one not contributing and using pressure tactics. The author has every right to say no to sharing their meal without feeling guilty.\n"
