He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and uses the author's car. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, staring until they give in. The author makes sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a point of contention. The author is covering all expenses, which could imply an imbalance. But the question is about sharing food. The author mentions that they make sure there's enough for both, so maybe they're not depriving the friend entirely. However, the friend is asking for a portion of the author's specific meal, not just sharing what's available. \n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in might indicate manipulation or pressure. The author is being asked to share their personal meal, which they might not be comfortable with. If the author is making separate meals, maybe they have different dietary needs or preferences. Forcing someone to share their personal food could be seen as taking advantage of the situation, especially since the friend isn't contributing financially. \n\nOn the other hand, living together sometimes requires some level of sharing. But the key here is that the friend isn't paying their share, so the author might feel it's unfair to also share their personal meals. The friend's actions could be seen as taking more than their fair share without contributing. The author's decision to not share might be a boundary they need to set, given the unequal contribution. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to maintain a balance where they cover the costs and set boundaries about their personal meals. The friend might need to either contribute financially or respect the author's choice to not share every meal. The answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
