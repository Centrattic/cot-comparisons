He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay rent or bills, uses the car, and sometimes is loud or dirty. But the main issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meal each time they eat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The author is covering all the expenses, including food. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a point. However, the author mentions that they ensure there's enough food for both, just not always the same type. So maybe they have separate meals sometimes, but the friend still wants a share of the author's specific meal.\n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in suggests some pressure. The author is feeling compelled to give in, which might be uncomfortable. The key here is whether the author is obligated to share their personal meal. Since they already provide enough food for both, maybe the author isn't at fault for not sharing their specific portion. The friend's request could be seen as taking without asking politely, or even a bit manipulative with the staring. \n\nHowever, since they are best friends and live together, there's an expectation of mutual respect and consideration. If the friend is hungry, they could prepare their own meal. The author is already ensuring there's food available. The issue might be the friend's insistence on taking from the author's plate rather than having their own. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about boundaries. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to share their personal meal, especially since they're not the one not contributing. The friend might need to respect the author's choice without pressure. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
