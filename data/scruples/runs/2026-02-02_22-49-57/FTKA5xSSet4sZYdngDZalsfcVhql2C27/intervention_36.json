He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, lives for free, and relies on the author for transportation. The friend asks for a portion of the author's meal, often through staring, and the author usually gives in but sometimes doesn't.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the living arrangements and the friend's lack of financial contribution. The author is covering all the costs, which might imply an unspoken agreement or expectation. However, personal space and autonomy are also important. The friend's demand for food, even without outright asking, could be seen as taking advantage. The author is asserting their right to not share, which is a personal choice. The friend's behavior of staring might be pressure, but the author isn't obligated to comply. Since the friend isn't paying for groceries, it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing.\n"
