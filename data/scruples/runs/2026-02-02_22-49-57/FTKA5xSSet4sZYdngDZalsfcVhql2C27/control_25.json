He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they live with their best friend who doesn't pay any bills, doesn't pay for groceries, and relies on the author for transportation. The friend also has some habits like being loud, dirty, and smelly, but the author puts up with all that because of their friendship. Now, the issue is that whenever the author eats, the friend wants a portion of their meal. The author makes sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend doesn't explicitly ask but stares until the author gives in or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially to the shared living expenses. So the author is covering all the costs, which is a big deal. If the friend is consistently taking food portions from the author's meals, even if there's food available, it's possible that the author isn't obligated to share their specific meal. The fact that the friend doesn't pay for groceries might mean that the author is the one buying the food, so the author's meal is their personal purchase. \n\nBut then again, if they're sharing a kitchen and groceries are bought for the household, maybe the food isn't entirely the author's to control. However, the author mentions that they make sure there's enough food for both, so maybe the friend has access to other food. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in seems manipulative. The author isn't forced to share their personal meal portions, especially if they're paying for them. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friendship aspect complicates things. The author is tolerant of the friend's other habits, so maybe expecting the friend to respect their food choices is reasonable. The friend's actions could be seen as taking advantage of the author's generosity. The fact that the friend doesn't have a car and relies on the author for transportation adds to the imbalance in the living situation. \n\nThe author might be in the right because they're not obligated to share their specific meals if they're paying for them. However, if the food is part of shared groceries, maybe the friend has a right to it. But the author clarifies that they make sure there's enough food for both, implying that the friend isn't left without food. The friend's approach is passive-aggressive, and the author's giving in might be out of guilt rather than willingness. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the friend isn't contributing financially, so it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for not sharing their personal meal when there's already food available for the friend. The friend's behavior is more problematic here, as they're not respecting the author's autonomy regarding their own food.\n"
