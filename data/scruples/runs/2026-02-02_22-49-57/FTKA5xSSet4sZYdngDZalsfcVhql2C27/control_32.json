He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, relies on the author for transportation, and sometimes is loud, messy, and smelly. The main issue is when the author eats, the friend wants a portion, even though there's supposedly enough food for both, just not the same type. The friend doesn't ask directly, just stares until the author gives in or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is providing a lot, not just in terms of food but also covering bills and transportation. The friend is living for free and not contributing financially. That's a big part. The author is making sure there's food available, but maybe not the same meals each time. The friend is pressuring the author by staring, which is non-verbal but still a form of coercion.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong for not sharing. In a normal friendship, mutual respect and consideration are important. The author is already covering a lot of the friend's needs. If the friend is getting enough food in general, maybe from shared groceries, then insisting on taking a portion every time the author eats might be too much. Especially if the author is making their own meals and the friend isn't contributing financially.\n\nBut the friend is the author's best friend, so there might be an expectation of generosity. However, the author is not obligated to share their meal every time. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in is manipulative. The author has the right to eat their own food without pressure. The fact that the friend doesn't ask directly but uses passive-aggressive tactics might indicate that the friend isn't respecting the author's autonomy in this matter.\n\nAlso, since the friend isn't paying for their own groceries, maybe the author is already providing food for them in other ways. So when the author is eating something specific, the friend might not need to take a portion if there's already food available. The key here is whether the author is being reasonable in setting boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong if they decide not to share their individual meal portions, especially when the friend isn't contributing and is using pressure tactics. So the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong."
