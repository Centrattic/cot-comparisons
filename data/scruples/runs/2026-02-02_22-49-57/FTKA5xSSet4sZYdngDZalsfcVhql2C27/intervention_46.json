He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend who lives with them for free. The friend doesn't pay bills, groceries, or have a car, so the author covers all the costs. The main issue is that the friend keeps asking for a portion of their meals, usually by staring until the author gives in. The question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living situation. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might mean the author is shouldering all the expenses. If the author is cooking meals specifically for themselves, it's reasonable to expect they can eat what they prepared without pressure. The friend's behavior of staring and not outright asking could be seen as passive-aggressive or disrespectful. The author might feel entitled to their own food since they're covering the costs.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that sharing food is a social norm, especially among friends. But in this case, the friend isn't contributing, so the author might not have an obligation to share. The key points are financial responsibility, mutual respect, and boundaries. The author is maintaining boundaries by not always giving in, which is their right. The friend's actions (staring, not paying) could be problematic, but the author isn't in the wrong for setting these limits.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their own food, especially since they're covering all the costs. The friend's behavior is the issue here, not the author's refusal to share when they choose.\n"
