He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and their best friend live together. The friend doesn't pay any bills, doesn't pay for groceries, and doesn't have a car, so the author takes them everywhere. The main issue is that the friend always asks for a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, and the author usually gives in even though they don't have to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangements and responsibilities. The friend isn't contributing financially at all. That's a big deal because typically, when people live together, they share the costs. The author is shouldering all the bills and groceries, which might set a precedent where the friend is used to not contributing. Now, when it comes to food, even though the author makes sure there's enough food for both, the friend is trying to take a portion of the author's specific meal. The author is not obligated to share their food, especially if it's something they prepared for themselves. \n\nThe friend's behavior here is a bit passive-aggressive, using a stare to pressure the author into giving them food. That's not respecting the author's autonomy. The author might feel taken advantage of, especially since they're already covering all the costs. It's their home and their food, so they should have the right to decide what they eat. The friend might be used to getting what they want without contributing, which is unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend is just used to sharing because they live together. But the key point is that the author is not obligated to share their meal. The food is part of their own groceries, and if they prepare a specific dish, it's their choice to eat it or not. The friend's entitlement to take a portion without being asked is problematic. The author's actions of giving in might be out of habit or guilt, but they aren't in the wrong for setting boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing their food. The friend is being inconsiderate and not respecting the author's personal space and choices. The author has every right to decide how they want to eat their meals, especially when they're the one covering the costs.\n"
