He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their best friend live together. The friend doesn't pay any bills or contribute to groceries, and relies on the author for transportation. The friend is sometimes loud, messy, and smelly, but the author tolerates this because they're friends. Now, the issue is that whenever the author eats, the friend wants a portion. The author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend doesn't ask directly but stares until the author gives in or not. The author is now questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend isn't contributing financially to the household, which might mean the author is covering all the costs, including food. The friend is demanding food portions through passive pressure (staring), and the author is conflicted. The author is trying to balance their friendship with their own needs.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend is living for free and expecting food without contributing. The author is providing enough for both but not always the same type. The friend's behavior of staring to get food might be seen as manipulative. The author isn't obligated to share their meal, especially if they're covering all the costs. However, the author might feel a sense of responsibility because of the friendship. But since the friend isn't contributing, the author has the right to set boundaries. So, the answer would likely be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The friend's actions are more problematic here because they aren't contributing and are pressuring the author.\n"
