He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the author takes them everywhere. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, and when the author doesn't give in, the friend just stares until they do. The author is now wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. They live together, but the friend doesn't contribute financially. That's a problem in itself because typically when people live together, they share expenses. The author is covering all the bills, including groceries, which might mean they're responsible for all the food in the house. But the friend is taking portions of the author's meals, even if there's enough food available. \n\nThe key points here are responsibility and boundaries. The author is providing for the basic needs (food, transportation, bills) but the friend isn't contributing. The friend's behavior of staring until they get what they want seems manipulative. Even if there's food in the house, the author's personal meal is their own, and the friend shouldn't expect to take it. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they usually give in. That implies that the friend is persistently pressuring them, and not respecting their autonomy over their own meals. The fact that the friend doesn't have the same type of food might not matter if the author is buying groceries for both. But if they're cooking something specific, the friend's request could be an overstep. \n\nI should think about what's reasonable in a friendship and roommate situation. The friend's lack of contribution makes it even more questionable. The author isn't obligated to share their personal meals, especially if it's causing discomfort. The friend's behavior of using a stare to get what they want is not respectful. \n\nSo the answer would likely be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries, especially since they're the one paying for everything. The friend needs to respect that and maybe learn to communicate better instead of using passive-aggressive tactics.\n"
