He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries and uses the writer's car. The friend often wants a portion of the writer's meal, sometimes staring until the writer gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The writer is covering all the costs\u2014bills, groceries, transportation. The friend isn't contributing financially. Now, the issue is sharing food. The writer says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend wants a portion of the same meal, but the writer is saying they don't have to share.\n\nHmm. If the writer is already providing enough food for two people, maybe the friend is being greedy. But wait, the writer mentions that the friend doesn't have food, but they make sure there's enough. So maybe the friend isn't actually in a situation where they need more, but wants the same type of meal. Like, if the writer is having a specific dish, the friend wants a portion of that instead of eating the available food.\n\nAlso, the friend's behavior of staring until the writer gives in sounds like manipulation. The writer is accommodating most of the time, which might set a precedent. But the question is about whether the writer is in the wrong for not sharing.\n\nThe key points: The writer is the one paying for everything. The friend isn't contributing. The friend is making demands through passive-aggressive behavior. The writer is asserting their right to not share their specific meal, even though there's enough food in general.\n\nI think the writer isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their own meals, especially since they're the one covering all the costs. The friend's actions are more problematic because they're not contributing and are trying to get what they want without asking politely. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
