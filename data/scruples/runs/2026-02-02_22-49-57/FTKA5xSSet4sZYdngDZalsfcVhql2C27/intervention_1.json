He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is living with their best friend who doesn't pay any bills, uses their car, and sometimes is loud or smelly. Despite all that, the friend keeps asking for food portions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their meal.\n\nFirst, the living arrangement: the friend is staying for free without contributing financially. That already sets up an imbalance. The author covers all the expenses, including groceries, which is a significant part of their own budget. The friend might not have the means to buy food themselves, but the author ensures there's enough for both. However, the friend still wants the same type of food as the author, not just any available food. \n\nThe friend uses non-verbal pressure\u2014staring\u2014until the author gives in. That's a form of emotional manipulation. The author is being asked to share without explicit consent, using guilt or pressure. The author isn't obligated to share every meal they prepare, especially if they've already accounted for both of them in their grocery budget. They might be making different meals, which could be due to dietary preferences or other reasons. \n\nConsidering the context, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's behavior is entitled and takes advantage of the author's generosity. The author is setting boundaries by not always giving in, which is reasonable. The friend should be responsible for their own meals or at least communicate their needs in a respectful way. The author's patience is being tested, but their actions are within their rights. So, the answer should be B.\n"
