He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries and lives for free. The author makes sure there's enough food for both, but the friend expects portions from the author's meals. The friend uses passive-aggressive stares to get the author to share.\n\nFirst, the living arrangement: the friend isn't contributing financially. That's a significant point. Even though they're friends, basic fairness might expect some contribution, especially if one is not paying for shared expenses. However, the author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, so maybe they're splitting the groceries. But the friend is taking from the author's specific meal, not just the shared supplies. \n\nThe key issue is the friend's entitlement to the author's personal meal without contributing. The author might feel their own meal is separate, and the friend's behavior is inconsiderate. The friend's lack of action (just staring) and the author giving in out of pressure could indicate manipulation.\n\nFriendship dynamics matter here. While they're close, boundaries are important. The author might be setting a boundary by not sharing, which is their right. However, the friend's lack of contribution complicates things. If the author is covering all costs, maybe they expect some respect in return. The friend's actions might be seen as taking advantage. \n\nThe picture (which I can't see) probably shows the situation. The answer hinges on whether sharing is expected when one isn't contributing. The author isn't in the wrong if they set boundaries, especially since the friend isn't helping with expenses. So, answer B (No).\n"
