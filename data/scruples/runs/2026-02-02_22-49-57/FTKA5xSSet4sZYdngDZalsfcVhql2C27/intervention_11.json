He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is that the friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses their car, and sometimes is loud or dirty. But the main issue is that whenever the author eats, the friend wants a portion, and the author sometimes gives in but not always.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is making sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend doesn't ask directly but uses a stare. The author feels pressured. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if the author is already providing enough food for both, even if it's not the same, then the friend's behavior might be seen as taking without asking. The author has the right to their own food. However, since they are best friends and live together, there's an expectation of sharing, but that doesn't mean the author has to give up their own meal every time. The friend's passive-aggressive approach (staring instead of asking) could be the issue here.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, which makes sense. The author is setting boundaries, which is important. If the friend is always taking without asking, that's on the friend. The fact that the author already ensures there's enough food for both might mean they aren't at fault for not sharing further. The friend's behavior is more problematic. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
