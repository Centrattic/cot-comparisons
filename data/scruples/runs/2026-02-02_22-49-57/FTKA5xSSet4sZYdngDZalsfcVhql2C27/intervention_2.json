He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author lives with a best friend who doesn't pay rent or bills, doesn't have a car, and the author takes care of groceries. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, sometimes just staring until the author gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might already be a point of contention. The author is making food but not always the same type, which might mean the friend's meals aren't exactly what they want. The friend uses passive pressure, like staring, to get a share. The author usually gives in but is now questioning if that's right.\n\nThe key points are: the friend isn't covering any expenses, and the author is feeling pressured to share their food. The author might be taking care of the friend's basic needs but not necessarily their specific meal preferences. The friend's behavior of staring until they get their way could be seen as manipulative or inconsiderate.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the author is responsible for all costs and the friend is free-riding, the author isn't obligated to share every meal. The friend's actions might be exploiting the author's generosity. The question is about boundaries. The author has the right to set limits, especially when the friend isn't contributing. However, the author might feel guilty because they're friends, but that doesn't mean they're wrong to not share if they choose to.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing food. They have a right to their own food, especially since the friend isn't contributing to the household. The friend's behavior is more problematic here. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
