He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or groceries, and often takes a portion of the author's meals. The author says they usually give in but now they're resisting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is living for free, not contributing financially. That's a big point. If the friend isn't contributing to the household expenses, it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries. Food is a personal item, and while sharing can be a gesture of friendship, it's not a requirement. The friend's behavior of staring to get food might be seen as manipulative or taking advantage.\n\nThe author mentions they ensure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. That implies they're providing food, but the friend is taking more than their share. The author has the right to decide how to allocate their own food, especially if it's their own cooking or purchase. The friend's actions could be seen as entitlement, especially since they don't contribute financially.\n\nHowever, the author and friend are close, so there's a personal relationship aspect. But even in friendships, boundaries are important. The author isn't being mean by not sharing; they're asserting their right to their own food. The friend's lack of contribution makes the situation more about fairness. The author is trying to balance friendship with personal rights.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're setting boundaries that their friend isn't respecting. The friend's behavior is the issue here, not the author's decision to not share every meal. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
