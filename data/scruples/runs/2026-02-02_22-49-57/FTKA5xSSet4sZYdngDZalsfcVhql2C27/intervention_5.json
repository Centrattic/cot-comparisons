He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses their car, and sometimes is loud or dirty. The main issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, using a stare as a tactic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might already be a point of contention. The author is covering all expenses, so maybe they feel entitled to not share their food. But since they're best friends, the social expectation might be to share, especially if they split costs. However, the friend isn't contributing, so maybe the author is justified in not sharing.\n\nThe friend's behavior is passive-aggressive\u2014staring until the author gives in. That's not respectful. The author is making sure there's enough food, but the friend wants the same type. Maybe the author is cooking for both, but the friend isn't contributing. The key point is that the author isn't in the wrong if they're not obligated to share their food. The friend's expectation to get a portion without contributing is the issue here. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
