He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their best friend live together. The friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and has some habits that are annoying (loud, dirty, smelly). However, the author puts up with all of this because they're friends.\n\nThe main issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meal every time. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend doesn't directly ask but stares until the author complies. The author is now questioning if they're wrong for not sharing.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, the friend is living there for free, not contributing financially, and now expecting food. The author mentions they already provide food for both, so maybe the friend should be expected to take from the shared groceries instead of the author's plate each time. Also, the friend's behavior of staring instead of asking directly might be considered passive-aggressive or inconsiderate.\n\nBut the author is a person who is making their own meal. If they're cooking something specific, it's reasonable to expect that someone else not contributing might need to take from the shared food rather than the author's personal portion. The author might be within their rights to not share if they've already ensured there's food available for the friend.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author and friend have an unspoken agreement where sharing meals is part of their living arrangement. However, since the friend isn't contributing to the household expenses, it's possible that the author is being taken advantage of in multiple ways. The friend might not realize that taking from the author's meal is an issue, especially if it's just assumed because of their friendship.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. They're providing food for both, so the friend should be eating from that shared food instead of expecting a share of the author's specific meal each time. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
