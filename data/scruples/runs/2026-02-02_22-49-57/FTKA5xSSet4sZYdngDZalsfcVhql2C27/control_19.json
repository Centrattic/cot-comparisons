He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or dirty. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time, and the author sometimes gives in but not always.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a red flag. Sharing expenses is usually expected when two people live together. If the friend is eating the author's food without contributing, that's an issue. The author mentions making sure there's enough food for both, but not the same type. Maybe the friend isn't cooking their own meals, relying on the author's prepared dishes.\n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in seems manipulative. The author is setting boundaries by sometimes saying no, which is their right. They have a right to their own food. The friend's demands without contributions are unfair. However, the author is being generous by ensuring there's food available. The key point is whether the friend's actions are respectful. Since the friend is taking without contributing and using passive-aggressive tactics, the author isn't wrong for not sharing. The responsibility lies with the friend to contribute or cook their own meals. The author is maintaining boundaries, which is appropriate. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
