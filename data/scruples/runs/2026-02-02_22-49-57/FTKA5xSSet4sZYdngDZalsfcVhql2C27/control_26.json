He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the friend often wants a portion of the author's meal. The author says they usually give in, but now they're wondering if not sharing is the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, so the author is covering all the expenses. That's a big deal because splitting costs is usually a part of rooming with someone. If the friend isn't paying their share, the author isn't obligated to feed them. But they do make sure there's enough food for both, even if not the same type. So maybe the author is providing some food, but the friend is always taking from the author's specific meals.\n\nThe friend doesn't outrightly ask, but stares until the author gives in. That's passive-aggressive behavior. The friend is making the author feel pressured, which is unfair. The author is being kind by sharing, but the friend's actions are disrespectful. The author's right to their own meal is important. If the friend is taking portions without consent, that's a problem. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here. They can choose not to share their food, especially since the friend isn't contributing. So the answer should be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
