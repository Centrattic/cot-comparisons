He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the friend often wants a portion of the author's meal without directly asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend lives for free, doesn't contribute to expenses, and the author is the one handling transportation. The main issue is that the friend wants food from the author's meal. The author sometimes gives in, but now is questioning if they should stop. \n\nThe user is in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) forum, so community opinions might vary. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author is responsible for groceries, the friend doesn't pay for them, and the friend is taking food without asking. The author is providing enough food for both, but the friend wants the same type as them. \n\nThe picture linked (even though I can't see it) might show the author's meal, and the friend wanting a part. The friend's non-verbal cue (staring) is a passive way to request, but the author is not obligated to share. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the author is covering all costs, including groceries, the friend should be responsible for their own food. However, the author mentions they ensure there's enough food for both, which might imply they sometimes buy shared items. But the friend is now taking from the author's specific meal. \n\nIn terms of boundaries, the author has the right to set them. If the friend is not contributing financially and is taking the author's food, it's reasonable for the author to stop sharing. The friend might need to either contribute or get their own food. The author isn't in the wrong for not sharing, especially since the friend isn't covering their own expenses. \n\nAnother angle: the friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in is manipulative. The author has the right to say no. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
