He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The friend lives with them, doesn't pay any bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and is sometimes loud or dirty. But the issue is when the author eats, the friend wants a portion. The author says they always make sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend just stares until the author gives in.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics of their living situation. The friend isn't contributing financially, which could be a point of tension. The author is covering all the bills, groceries, and transportation. That's a lot. But the main question is about sharing individual meals. The friend is asking for a portion each time the author eats. The author is not giving in, but the friend is pressuring them. \n\nIs the friend's request reasonable? If they both have food available, maybe the friend should prepare their own meals instead of relying on the author's. The author mentions there's enough food, just not the same type. So maybe the friend isn't cooking or finding his own food, expecting the author to feed him every time. That could be an issue of responsibility. \n\nAlso, the friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in might be manipulative. The author is in a position where they might feel obligated, but it's their own meal. They have the right to choose what they eat, especially since they're not responsible for the friend's personal food choices beyond the shared groceries. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being a good friend by putting up with the friend's other habits. But sharing every meal seems excessive. The friend's actions might be taking advantage of the author's generosity. The author isn't in the wrong for not sharing their own prepared meals if the friend isn't contributing. So maybe the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries here.\n"
