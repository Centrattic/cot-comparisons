He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The friend doesn't pay rent or groceries, uses their car, and sometimes is loud and smelly. The friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, and the author usually gives in but now is resisting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend is living there for free, which might mean the author is covering all expenses. The friend's demands for food might add to the financial burden. The author mentions they make sure there's enough food, but not necessarily the same type. The friend is just staring until the author gives in, which sounds manipulative.\n\nThe key issue is whether it's reasonable for the author to not share their meal. The friend isn't starving; there's already food available. The author isn't obligated to share their own meal. The friend's behavior of staring to pressure sharing could be seen as taking advantage. The author's right to their own food without coercion is important here. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
