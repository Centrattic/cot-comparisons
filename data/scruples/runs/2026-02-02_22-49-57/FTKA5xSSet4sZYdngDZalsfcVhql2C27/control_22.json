He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud, messy, or smelly. The main issue is the friend taking a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, even though there's supposedly enough food for both. The author usually gives in but is now questioning if not sharing is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a significant factor. If the author is covering all expenses, maybe the friend's expectation to get a part of every meal is unfair. The author mentions making sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. So maybe the friend is taking from the author's specific meal rather than the shared food. The friend's non-verbal pressure (staring) to get food could be seen as manipulative. \n\nThe author's perspective is that they're being taken advantage of, even though they tolerate other issues. The question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing. Legally or morally, if someone is not paying for their own food, expecting another person to provide it could be considered unreasonable. The friend's actions might be seen as entitlement, especially if they have their own food but still take from the author's. \n\nHowever, the friendship aspect complicates things. The author might feel obligated to share due to their relationship. But if the friend isn't contributing, the author has the right to set boundaries. The key points are consent, contribution, and mutual respect. Since the friend isn't paying for groceries, expecting to take another person's meal could be seen as unfair. The author isn't wrong for not sharing because the friend isn't contributing equally. Plus, the friend's behavior of staring until compliance suggests manipulation, which isn't respectful. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary and not sharing their meal when they choose not to. The friend's actions indicate they should be responsible for their own food, especially since they aren't contributing financially. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
