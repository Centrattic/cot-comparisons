He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not sharing their food with their best friend who lives with them. The friend doesn't pay bills or groceries and relies on them for transportation. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of every meal the author eats, sometimes just staring until the author gives in.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they make sure there's enough food, even if not the same type. So they're providing food for both. The friend isn't exactly asking politely but using a stare to pressure sharing. The author usually gives in but now is considering not sharing anymore.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The friend isn't paying for their share, which seems unfair. The author is providing for them, but the friend's behavior of staring to get food might be seen as manipulative. The author has the right to set boundaries about their food, especially since they're the one covering all expenses. The friend's actions could be pushing the author's patience, but the author isn't obligated to share every meal. So the author isn't in the wrong here because they're maintaining their own space and respecting their own needs. The friend's behavior is problematic, not the author's decision to not share when they choose to.\n"
