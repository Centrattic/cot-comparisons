He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. Let me break this down. The author and their friend live together. The friend doesn't pay bills, groceries, or has a car, so the author covers those. The friend is sometimes loud, dirty, and smelly, but the author puts up with it because they're best friends.\n\nThe main issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meal every time. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend doesn't ask, just stares until the author gives in. The picture (which I can't see, but maybe describes) probably shows the friend eyeing the food.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide between A (yes, wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the friend isn't contributing to living expenses. The author is covering all costs. Sharing food might be expected in a friendship, but if it's every meal without asking, that's different. The author is already making sure there's enough for both, so maybe the friend should be content with that. The friend's approach of staring instead of asking is passive and maybe manipulative. The author isn't obligated to share their meal, especially if it's their own food. The friend's lack of contribution might make the situation more about the friend not pulling their weight. So the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here. Answer B.\n"
