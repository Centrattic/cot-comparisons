He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. Let's start by understanding the situation. The user and their best friend live together, and the friend doesn't pay any bills, groceries, or have a car. The user takes them everywhere. The main issue is that whenever the user eats, the friend wants a portion, but the user isn't always sharing. The friend doesn't have their own food, but the user ensures there's enough for both, though not necessarily the same type.\n\nFirst, the friend isn't contributing financially. That seems like a significant point. If the user is covering all the costs, including groceries, then the friend is relying on the user's resources. But the user mentions that they make sure there's enough food for both of them, just not the same type. So maybe the user provides food that's separate, but the friend expects to share when the user is eating specific meals.\n\nThe friend's approach is to stare until the user gives in. That's a bit passive-aggressive. The user is in a position where they have to cover all expenses, so they might be feeling taken advantage of. If the friend is asking for a portion every time the user eats, that's a lot of times. Even if there's enough food overall, the user might be tired of giving in repeatedly. \n\nBut the user is their best friend and has been tolerating other issues like noise and mess. The question is about food sharing. The user isn't sharing in the sense of giving the same type of food, but they do provide enough for both. So maybe the friend is making a demand for the exact same meal each time, which the user isn't obligated to do. \n\nIf the user is responsible for all the groceries, then the friend should have their own meals if possible. However, the user does make sure there's enough food for both, so maybe they're splitting the costs implicitly. The friend's behavior of staring and expecting a share could be seen as manipulative. \n\nOn the other hand, living together often involves sharing resources, and if the friend is eating the same meals as the user, it's natural to split the cost. But the user isn't always doing that. The key here is whether the friend is being respectful and considering the user's preferences and boundaries. The user might feel that their space and personal meals are being invaded. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong if they're setting boundaries and the friend isn't respecting it. The friend is in a position where they benefit from the user's generosity but aren't contributing. The user is under no obligation to share their specific meals, especially if they're not the same. The friend's method of getting food (staring) is pushy. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
