He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them, doesn't pay rent or groceries, uses the author's car, and is sometimes loud and smelly. But they put up with it because they're best friends.\n\nThe main issue here is the food sharing. The friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend doesn't ask, just stares until the author gives in or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider fairness in a shared living situation. If the friend isn't contributing to groceries, it's reasonable for the author to feel they have the right to their own meals. Even if there's food available, the friend is imposing by taking from the author's portion. The fact that the friend doesn't ask but uses a stare to pressure the author is manipulative. The author is setting boundaries by sometimes not giving in, which is their right.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel entitled since they have some food available. But the author is the one providing the food, so the expectation of sharing isn't necessarily mutual. The friend's behavior of not paying bills and using the car without contributing also adds context. The author is managing a living arrangement where their friend isn't pulling their weight, which could justify the author being firm about their own meals.\n\nIt's about mutual respect and boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong if they choose not to share their food, especially when the friend isn't contributing to the household. The friend's entitlement might be the issue here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
