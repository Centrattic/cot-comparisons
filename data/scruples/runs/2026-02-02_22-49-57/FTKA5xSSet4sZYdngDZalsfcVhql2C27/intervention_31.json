He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The friend doesn't pay bills, doesn't pay for groceries, and relies on the author for transportation. The friend often asks for a portion of the author's meal, sometimes through staring, and the author usually gives in but not always.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is living with the author without contributing financially. The author is covering all the expenses. So the friend's behavior of expecting food might be a result of not contributing. The friend doesn't have their own car, so maybe that's part of the reason they depend on the author.\n\nThe key point is whether the author is obligated to share their food. The author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend's method of staring to get the meal portion might be seen as manipulative or passive-aggressive. \n\nThe author is in a situation where they're already shouldering all the costs. If the friend isn't contributing, expecting the author to share every meal they prepare might be unfair. The author has the right to decide how they use their own food, especially since they're covering the costs. \n\nHowever, the friend is a best friend, so maybe there's an expectation of generosity. But the author is setting boundaries now, which is important. The friend's behavior of not paying bills and not contributing to groceries is a significant factor. It's not just about sharing food but about the overall fairness in the living arrangement.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing their own food, especially since they already handle all the expenses. The friend's actions might be part of a pattern of taking without giving back. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
