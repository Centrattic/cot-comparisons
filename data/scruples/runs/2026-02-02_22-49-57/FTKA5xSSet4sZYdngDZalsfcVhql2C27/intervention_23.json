He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The scenario is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, the author covers everything, and the friend keeps asking for portions of their meals. The author sometimes gives in but not always.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the friend's expectation to get food without contributing. The author is providing for groceries, so the friend isn't contributing financially. Then there's the social aspect of living together, which usually involves some shared responsibilities. Even though it's friends, when you live together, splitting costs is common. The friend might be taking advantage here.\n\nThe author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, but not the same type. So maybe the friend is getting leftovers or other food, but not the specific meal the author is eating. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in could be seen as manipulative. The author might feel pressured into sharing when they don't want to.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is setting a boundary by not always giving in. They're maintaining their right to keep their own food. The friend's lack of contribution to the household is a key point. The author is covering all expenses, so expecting to share their personal meal might be unfair.\n\nAnother angle is the social dynamics. Even if they're best friends, living together with financial imbalance can create tension. The author is managing their own resources, which is reasonable. The friend might need to take more initiative in providing for themselves instead of expecting the author to cover everything.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to balance their friendship with their own needs and boundaries. The friend's behavior is more problematic here. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
