He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them for free, doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the friend often wants a portion of the author's meals, sometimes just staring until the author gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangements. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might mean the author is covering all expenses. If the author is making sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type, maybe the friend isn't cooking their own meals. The friend's request for a portion might be about wanting the same type of food the author is eating, not just any food available.\n\nThe author says they don't have to share, and the friend uses passive pressure (staring) which the author usually gives in to. The question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing. On one hand, the friend isn't paying for the food, so the author might feel it's unfair to share. On the other hand, they're friends and living together, so maybe there's an expectation of sharing resources. But the author is already providing enough food for both, so maybe the friend should take from the available food instead of the author's specific meal.\n\nAlso, the friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in could be seen as manipulation. The author isn't obligated to share their meal if they don't want to, especially if they're not getting anything in return. However, since they're living together, there might be unspoken agreements about sharing. But the key point is that the author is ensuring there's enough food for both, so the friend should have their own portion from the shared groceries. The author isn't in the wrong for not sharing their personal meal when the friend has access to the general food supply.\n"
