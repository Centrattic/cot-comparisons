He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (ITA) is in the wrong for not sharing food with their roommate/best friend. The key points here are the living arrangement, financial responsibilities, and the specific issue of food sharing.\n\nFirst, the roommate doesn't pay rent, bills, or groceries, and relies on the author for transportation. That seems exploitative. The author is covering all costs, which might set the stage for why they're hesitant to share food. The roommate also has bad habits like being loud and smelly but is tolerated because they're friends.\n\nThe main issue is the roommate continuously wanting portions of the author's meals without being asked. The author ensures there's enough food available, but the roommate expects the same type of food. The author usually gives in, but now they're questioning if they should continue.\n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, if the roommate isn't contributing financially and the food is the author's own meal, then the author has the right to decide how to use their own food. The roommate isn't in a position to demand or expect food if it's not part of an agreed-upon arrangement. The author is maintaining boundaries here, which is reasonable. The fact that the roommate uses passive-aggressive tactics (staring until the author gives in) adds to the problem. The author isn't obligated to share if the roommate isn't contributing, so the answer should be B.\n"
