He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (ITA) is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them. The friend doesn't pay any bills, groceries, or has a car, and the author takes care of all that. The friend sometimes is loud and dirty but is tolerated because they're best friends. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, and the author usually gives in but not always. The friend uses a silent stare to pressure them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is living with the author without contributing financially. The author is covering all the expenses, transportation, etc., which is a lot. Now, the friend expects to be fed every time the author eats. The author mentions they always make sure there's enough food, but maybe not the same type. So the friend is asking for food they didn't buy, while the author is providing food in general but not necessarily the specific meal they're eating.\n\nIs the friend's request reasonable? If the author is cooking a meal, does the friend have a right to expect a portion? The friend might think since they live together, they should share meals. But the author is paying for all the groceries, so maybe the friend isn't contributing to the cost of the specific meals. The silent staring to pressure the author into sharing could be seen as manipulative. The author is in a situation where they're already shouldering all the financial and logistical responsibilities. Expecting them to share every meal they prepare might not be fair, especially if the friend isn't paying for their share of the groceries.\n\nThe author might be justified in setting boundaries here. If the friend wants to eat the same meals, they should contribute to the cost. If they don't, the author isn't obligated to share. The fact that the friend sometimes is loud and dirty adds to the imbalance. The author is tolerating those behaviors but still should have the right to their own food when they prepare it.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have every right to not share their meals if they're not contributing financially. The friend's behavior of pressuring for food without contributing is the issue here.\n"
