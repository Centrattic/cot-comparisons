He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. They live together, but the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries. The friend also uses their car and sometimes is loud and smelly.\n\nSo, the main issue is that the friend wants a portion of their meal every time they eat. The poster says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend just stares until the poster gives in or not. Usually, they do give in.\n\nHmm. Well, the friend isn't contributing to the household expenses at all. That's a big deal. If they're living for free, then maybe the expectations of sharing food are different. But the poster is already making sure there's food available. However, the friend is taking from the meals the poster is eating, which is personal. \n\nThe key here is consent. The friend isn't asking politely; they're staring until the poster complies. That's pressuring the poster. The poster is allowed to say no to sharing their meal if they don't want to. Since the friend is contributing nothing else, maybe the poster isn't obligated to share their food further. \n\nAlso, the poster mentions they put up with other things like being loud and dirty. But the food issue is more about personal choices. It's reasonable for the poster to set boundaries here. So, the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong. They can choose to share or not without guilt, especially since the friend isn't contributing anything.\n"
