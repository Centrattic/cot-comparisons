He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's think about this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them. The friend doesn't pay any bills, groceries, or has a car, so the author is covering all the costs. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, sometimes just staring until the author gives in.\n\nFirst, the main point is about sharing personal meals. The friend is living for free, which already means the author is shouldering all the financial responsibilities. The author mentions they always provide enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend's request for a portion might not be about quantity but the type of food the author is eating. \n\nThe author is taking them everywhere, which is another responsibility. The friend's behavior of staring is a form of passive pressure, which isn't respectful. The author has a right to their own meals without being coerced. While they might have a strong friendship, that doesn't mean the author is obligated to share every personal portion, especially since the friend isn't contributing to the expenses. \n\nIt's important to consider boundaries in a shared living situation. Even with friends, mutual respect and clear expectations are necessary. The friend might need to understand that the author's meals are their own choice, and if they want the same type, they should either contribute or communicate their needs respectfully. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting this boundary. They've been accommodating in other areas, but sharing personal food portions isn't a requirement. The friend's actions are more about taking advantage of the current arrangement without considering the author's autonomy.\n"
