He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (TA) is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the friend often wants portions of their meals without being asked directly. The TA usually gives in but is now questioning if they're wrong for not sharing.\n\nFirst, the living arrangement: the friend isn't contributing financially. That's a red flag. Even if they're friends, splitting expenses is usually expected in shared housing. The TA covers all costs, which might create an imbalance.\n\nNext, the food sharing issue. The friend wants a portion every time the TA eats, but the TA isn't making the same type of food. The friend uses passive-aggressive tactics like staring until the TA complies. That sounds like manipulation. The TA is making an effort to ensure there's food for both, but maybe not exactly what the friend wants. The key here is consent\u2014does the friend have the right to demand a portion? Probably not, especially since they have their own food available.\n\nThe TA's reasoning is that they're putting up with other issues (noise, mess) for the friend's sake. But if the friend isn't contributing financially, it's fair for the TA to set boundaries. The food sharing seems like an overstep, especially when it's not mutual. The TA isn't obligated to share their meals unless it's agreed upon beforehand. The friend's behavior of expecting a portion without being asked is inconsiderate and possibly entitled.\n\nConsidering all factors, the TA isn't at fault for setting boundaries. They've been accommodating but now are recognizing the imbalance. It's reasonable for them to decide not to share when they choose. The friend's actions are more problematic here, not the TA's.\n"
