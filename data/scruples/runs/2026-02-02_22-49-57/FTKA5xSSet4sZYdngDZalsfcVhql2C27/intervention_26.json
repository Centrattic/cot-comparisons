He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that they live with their best friend, who doesn't pay bills or groceries and doesn't have a car. The friend often wants a portion of their meal, and the author usually gives in. They provided a picture, but I can't see images, so I'll go with the text.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the friend doesn't contribute to expenses. That's a red flag because if someone lives with you and isn't contributing, it can lead to resentment. The friend is taking food even though they have access to it, but maybe not the same type. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but the friend is pressuring them to share. The friend uses passive-aggressive tactics like staring until they comply. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. The friend's behavior is inconsiderate and maybe entitled. The author is being taken advantage of, especially since they're shouldering all the costs. However, the author might feel guilty for not sharing, especially with a friend. The key points are financial responsibility and mutual respect. If the friend isn't contributing, it's unfair to expect the author to share their meals. The author has the right to set boundaries. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
