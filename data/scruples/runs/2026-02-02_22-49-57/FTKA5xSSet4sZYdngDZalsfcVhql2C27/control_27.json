He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author lives with their best friend, who doesn't pay any bills or groceries and uses the author's car. The friend keeps asking for portions of the author's food, and the author sometimes gives in under pressure. The question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is already a problem. The author is taking care of groceries and transportation, which might create an imbalance. Now, the friend wants food portions, but the author isn't obligated to share. The friend's behavior of staring until the author complies sounds manipulative. The author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. Maybe they have different meals, but the friend is taking from the author's specific meal.\n\nI think the key points here are consent and boundaries. If the friend is pressuring the author to share, that's not respectful. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries around their own food, especially since the friend isn't contributing. The author is maintaining their own space and rights in the situation. The friend's actions are more inconsiderate, not the author's. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
