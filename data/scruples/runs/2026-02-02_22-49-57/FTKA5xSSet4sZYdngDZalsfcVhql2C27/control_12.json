He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

Let me break down the details.\n\nSo, the author and their best friend live together. The friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and the author covers all the costs. The friend also uses the author's car. The main issue is that whenever the author eats, the friend wants a portion. The friend doesn't have their own food, but the author says they always make sure there's enough food for both, even if it's not the same type. The friend just stares until the author gives in, which they usually do.\n\nFirst, the friend isn't contributing financially. That's a big point. The author is shouldering all the expenses, which might mean they have to budget carefully. If they're making sure there's food for both, maybe the friend isn't cooking their own meals. But the author isn't obligated to share their personal meals. If the author is paying for groceries, maybe the friend can take from the shared groceries but not from the author's specific meals. The friend's behavior of staring to get food might be manipulative. The author is setting boundaries by sometimes not sharing, which is understandable. So, is the author wrong? Probably not. They're not responsible for feeding the friend beyond what's already provided. The friend should take from the shared food or maybe start contributing. The author's choice to not share every time isn't the issue here. So the answer would be B.\n"
