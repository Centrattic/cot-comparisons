He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or groceries, and relies on the author for transportation. The friend often wants a share of the author's meal, and the author usually gives in but sometimes doesn't. The friend doesn't have food themselves, but the author makes sure there's enough, even if not the same type.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend is living there for free, not contributing financially. That's a big point. If you're sharing a home, it's usually expected that both contribute to expenses. Since the friend isn't paying, maybe the author shouldn't have to share their personal meals. But then again, they are friends, so maybe there's an unspoken expectation of sharing resources.\n\nThe author mentions that they make sure there's enough food for both, just not the same type. So maybe the friend is getting their own food, but wants the same as the author. The author is making meals, perhaps different from what the friend eats, and the friend wants a portion. The friend uses a stare to pressure the author into sharing. That passive-aggressive behavior might be the issue here.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is obligated to share their personal meal. If the author is cooking separate meals because of dietary preferences or choices, the friend shouldn't expect to get the same without contributing. Also, since the friend isn't paying their share, it's reasonable for the author to keep their meals to themselves. The friend's behavior of staring and pressuring the author is disrespectful. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially when the friend isn't covering their expenses. So the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
