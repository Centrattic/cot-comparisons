He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. Let me consider the details given.\n\nFirst, the friend lives with the author, doesn't pay any bills, and also doesn't contribute to groceries. The author is covering all the costs and providing transportation. The friend sometimes is loud and dirty, but they put up with it because they're friends. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meals whenever they eat, and the author feels pressured to give in. The friend doesn't have their own food, but the author ensures there's enough for both, though not always the same type. The friend uses passive-aggressive tactics like staring until the author gives in.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are consent, fairness, and boundaries. The author mentions that they don't force the friend to pay for anything and that they make sure there's food available. However, the friend is taking without explicit consent, using pressure through staring, and not contributing to shared expenses. This seems like an imbalance in the living arrangement. \n\nIn terms of food sharing, while it's common in some households, the friend's behavior of not paying their share of bills and groceries could justify the author setting boundaries. The friend's actions of expecting food without contributing financially might be seen as taking advantage. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to give up their meal when they've already covered all the costs. The friend should either contribute or make their own meals without pressuring the author. Therefore, the author isn't wrong for not sharing in this context.\n"
