He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, uses their car, and sometimes is loud or smelly. The main issue is that the friend keeps taking portions of their meals, and the author is conflicted about whether they're being unfair.\n\nSo, the key points here are the living arrangement and the financial responsibilities. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a big red flag. Sharing food might be expected in a roommate situation where everyone splits costs, but if one person isn't paying anything, it's unreasonable to expect them to share their meals. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is necessary. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in is a form of passive-aggressive pressure, which isn't respectful. The author is within their rights to decide how to handle their own food, especially since the friend isn't contributing. The author isn't in the wrong here because they're asserting their right to their own meals without being forced to share. The friend's actions are more problematic because of the lack of contribution and the pressure to share.\n"
