He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, usually ending up with the author giving in. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend doesn't pay for anything, which is a red flag. The fact that they take the author everywhere with their car adds to the imbalance. The main issue here is the expectation of sharing food when the friend isn't contributing. \n\nThe author mentions that they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. That might mean they have different meals sometimes, but the friend still expects a portion. The friend uses passive-aggressive tactics like staring until the author gives in. This could be a power dynamic where the friend feels entitled despite not contributing.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author made sure there's food for both, maybe they're already sharing. The friend's behavior of non-payment and expecting food might be the problem. The author isn't obligated to share personal meals if they're prepared for themselves. The friend's actions (staring, not contributing) could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut friends living for free without contributing can create an imbalance. The author might have a right to their own meals, especially if they're covering all costs. However, some might argue that sharing food is part of friendship. But since the friend isn't contributing, the author isn't obligated to share. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
