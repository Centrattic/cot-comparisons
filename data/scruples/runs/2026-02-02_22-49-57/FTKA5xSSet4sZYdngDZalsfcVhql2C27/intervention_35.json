He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of a \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or dirty. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meals, and the author usually gives in but is now questioning whether they should.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangements. The friend doesn't contribute financially, which is a significant point. The author covers all expenses, so it's reasonable that they might feel it's their own food they prepared. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in could be seen as manipulative or entitled.\n\nHowever, the author mentions they usually give in, indicating a pattern where the friend expects sharing. The question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing. From the author's perspective, since they pay for groceries, they might feel ownership over the food they prepare. The friend's lack of contribution could make it unfair for them to demand a share. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is making enough for both, even if different types, maybe there's an unspoken agreement to share. But the friend not paying their share complicates this. The author's tolerance for other issues (loudness, smell) might be part of their friendship dynamic, but that doesn't mean they should have to share food they specifically prepared. \n\nThe picture mentioned might show the friend taking food without asking, reinforcing the author's point. The friend's non-verbal pressure (staring) is a passive-aggressive tactic. The author's right to their own food is being challenged without reciprocity. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the friend isn't contributing to the household, the author isn't obligated to share every meal. The key is whether the author is being unreasonable in not complying with the friend's implied demands. Since the friend isn't paying for groceries, the author's stance makes sense. The answer is likely B (author not in the wrong), as the friend is taking without giving, and the author is asserting their right to their own food.\n"
