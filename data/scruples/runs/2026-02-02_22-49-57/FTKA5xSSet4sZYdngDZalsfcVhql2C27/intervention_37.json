He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that the author and their friend live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is messy or loud. The main issue is that the friend takes portions of the author's meals without being asked, even though there's enough food for both.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially but is allowed to live there for free. That's a big point. The author is taking care of all the expenses, which might mean they have to make decisions about shared resources. The friend's behavior of just taking food, even if there's enough, could be seen as taking advantage. The fact that the friend doesn't pay for groceries might imply that the author is responsible for purchasing, so the food is the author's to manage.\n\nThen there's the dynamic of the friendship. The author puts up with the friend's shortcomings (loudness, dirtiness) because they're friends. But the friend's actions regarding food might be crossing a line. The author is making food, ensuring there's enough, but the friend is taking without being asked. This could be a form of pressure or manipulation. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially when they're the one providing for the household.\n\nThe image linked shows a situation where the friend is taking from the author's plate, which visually supports the author's point. The friend's non-verbal pressure (staring) to get food might make the author feel uncomfortable. The author's decision to not share is a boundary, and they shouldn't feel guilty for that if they're the one providing.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's an unspoken agreement. If the friend is part of the household, maybe they should have access to the food provided. But since the friend isn't contributing, it's possible the author is the sole provider. The key is whether the friend is entitled to take without consent. The author is within their rights to say no, especially if they're not comfortable. The friend's behavior might need to change to respect the author's boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're managing their resources and setting limits with someone who isn't contributing. The friend's actions are inconsiderate and possibly manipulative. The answer should be B.\n"
