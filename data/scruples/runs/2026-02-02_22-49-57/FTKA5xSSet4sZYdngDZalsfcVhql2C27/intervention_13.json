He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a best friend living with them without paying bills or groceries, and the friend wants a share of their food every time they eat. The author makes sure there's enough food for both but not always the same type. The friend just stares until the author gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants others' opinions.\n\nLet me break it down. The friend lives for free, doesn't pay for anything, and relies on the author for transportation. That's a lot of one-sided support. Now, the issue is sharing food. The author makes sure there's food available, but the friend wants the same type. The author usually gives in but is now questioning if they should.\n\nThe question is about right and wrong. From a fairness perspective, if the author is providing food, even if it's not the same type, the friend should be grateful. But the friend is pressuring the author by staring, which is a form of passive-aggressive behavior. The author is not obligated to share their specific meal if they don't want to. The friend's actions might be considered inconsiderate, especially since they don't pay for their own food. The author is being generous by having enough food, but the friend's insistence could be a problem. So the author isn't in the wrong here because they're not forced to share every meal. The friend's behavior is more at fault. Therefore, the answer should be B (No)."
