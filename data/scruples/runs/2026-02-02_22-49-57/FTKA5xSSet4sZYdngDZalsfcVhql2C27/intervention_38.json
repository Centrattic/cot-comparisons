He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The setup is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and uses the author's car. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal without directly asking, and the author sometimes gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend doesn't contribute financially, which might be a point of contention. But the author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, even if it's not the same type. So maybe the author is providing enough food, just not the same as what they're eating. The friend is taking without asking, which could be seen as not respecting boundaries.\n\nThe key issue is the friend's behavior of taking without permission, using a stare to pressure the author. The author might feel uncomfortable being coerced into sharing. Since they live together, there should be mutual respect and communication. If the author has already ensured there's food, then not sharing their specific meal might not be wrong, especially if the friend isn't respecting their autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that sharing meals is a social norm, especially when living together. But the friend isn't contributing, so the author might not feel obligated. The picture might show the friend taking food, reinforcing the idea that it's without consent.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for refusing to share when it's not being offered. The friend's behavior seems more problematic. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
