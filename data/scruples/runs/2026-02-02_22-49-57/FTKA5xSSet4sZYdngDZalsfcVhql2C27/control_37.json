He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a best friend living together without paying any bills, including groceries, and the friend always wants a portion of the author's meal. The author sometimes gives in, sometimes not. The key points here are the living arrangement, financial contributions, and the friend's behavior regarding food.\n\nFirst, the friend is not contributing financially. They don't pay for any bills or groceries. Even though the author makes sure there's enough food for both, the friend doesn't have their own food but expects to share. The friend's actions of staring until the author gives in imply some form of pressure. The author is providing for the friend's basic needs without reciprocation.\n\nIn terms of social norms, roommates typically share expenses. If someone is living for free, it's reasonable to expect some form of contribution, especially when it comes to shared resources like food. The friend's behavior of not contributing and expecting to take from the author's meals might be seen as taking advantage. The author's resentment is understandable because they're shouldering all the costs and the friend isn't respecting boundaries by pressuring them for food.\n\nThe friend's loudness, messiness, and smell add to the stress. The author tolerates these because they're a best friend, but there's a limit. The friend's lack of reciprocity in the living arrangement is a problem. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to share their food when they've already covered all the expenses. The friend's unspoken expectation to take food without contributing is the issue here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing their food. The friend's behavior is the problem, not the author's refusal. The answer should be B.\n"
