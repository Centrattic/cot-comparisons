He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay rent or groceries, uses the author's car, and is sometimes messy but they tolerate it because they're friends. Now, the friend keeps asking for portions of the author's meals, which the author sometimes gives in to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, which already sets up a potential imbalance. The author is providing a place to stay, transportation, and food, but the friend is taking advantage by not paying and then also taking food from the author's portions. The author makes sure there's enough food, but not necessarily the same type. The friend uses passive-aggressive tactics like staring to get the food.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the friend isn't paying their share, so expecting the author to keep sharing their meals might be unreasonable. The author is already shouldering most of the responsibilities. Sharing food is a personal choice, and the friend's behavior could be seen as manipulative. The fact that the author sometimes gives in suggests they might feel pressured, which isn't healthy in a friendship. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially since the friend isn't contributing to their share. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing their food because the friend isn't respecting the author's contributions and is taking without giving back adequately. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
