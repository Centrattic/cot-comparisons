He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the friend often asks for a portion of the author's meals. The author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend uses silent pressure (staring) to get food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend doesn't contribute financially, which might be an underlying issue. But the main question is about sharing food. The author is providing enough food for both, but the friend wants the same type as the author is eating. The author is giving in sometimes but not always. The friend's behavior of staring is passive-aggressive, but the author is not compelled to share if they don't want to. \n\nIn a shared living situation, especially with unequal contributions, boundaries are important. The author is not obligated to share their personal meal, even if they ensure there's enough food otherwise. The friend's request might be reasonable if they were both contributing equally, but since the friend isn't paying for anything, the dynamics are different. The author is managing their own meals while providing other food. The friend's non-verbal pressure is disrespectful, but the author's refusal to share isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong (B) because they have the right to their own meals, especially when the friend isn't contributing to the household expenses. However, communication might help resolve the tension. But the question is specifically about being \"in the wrong,\" which in this context, the author isn't.\n"
