He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and the friend often wants a portion of their food. The author mentions they sometimes give in but not always, and the friend just stares until they do. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to check.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a point of tension. The author is covering all expenses, including groceries, but the friend expects to be fed. The friend's behavior of staring until they get food could be seen as manipulative or passive-aggressive. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the author is responsible for all the costs, it's reasonable for them to set boundaries about how food is shared. The friend might not be respecting the author's autonomy by pressuring them to share every meal. The author is making sure there's enough food overall, even if it's not the same type. That seems fair because they're providing for their needs and the friend's in other ways, but the friend is expecting immediate sharing every time.\n\nAlso, the friend's habits like being loud, dirty, and smelly are mentioned as things the author puts up with. This suggests a history of the author being tolerant of various issues, which might imply an unequal dynamic in the relationship. The food sharing issue could be another part of that imbalance. \n\nSo, the key points are: the friend isn't contributing financially, the author is covering all costs, the friend is pressuring for food sharing without reciprocating, and the author is setting boundaries. From a fairness perspective, the author isn't obligated to share every meal, especially if they're the one covering all expenses. The friend's expectation might be unreasonable given the lack of contribution. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their boundaries.\n"
