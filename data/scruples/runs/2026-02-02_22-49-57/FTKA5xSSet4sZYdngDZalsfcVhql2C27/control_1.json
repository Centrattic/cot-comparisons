He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend.\n\nFirst, the setup: the author and their best friend live together. The friend doesn't pay bills, groceries, or have a car, so the author handles all these things. The friend is sometimes loud, dirty, and smelly, but the author puts up with it because they're friends. Now, the main issue is that whenever the author eats, the friend wants a portion, even though there's usually enough food for both, though not always the same type. The friend doesn't ask but stares until the author gives in.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a big point. The author is covering all costs, including groceries. The friend's behavior of not asking and just staring to get food might be seen as taking without permission. The author is trying to set boundaries by not sharing each time, which is reasonable. \n\nBut the friend might feel entitled because they're living for free and there's food available. However, the author has the right to decide how they want to consume their own food. The friend's approach is passive-aggressive, which isn't healthy. The key point is that the author is maintaining boundaries despite the friend's pressure. The fact that there's enough food overall but not always the same type is a detail; the author is making sure there's enough, so the friend isn't left without food entirely. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing when the friend doesn't ask and is being pushy. The author is respecting their own needs and setting limits, which is necessary in any living arrangement. The friend's behavior is problematic, not the author's. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
