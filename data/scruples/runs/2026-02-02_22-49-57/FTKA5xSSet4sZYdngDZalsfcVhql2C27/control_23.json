He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the setup: they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the author covers everything. The friend doesn't have a car, so the author takes them places. The friend is sometimes loud, messy, and smelly, but the author tolerates it because they're best friends. Now, the main issue is that whenever the author eats, the friend wants a portion of their meal. The friend doesn't explicitly ask, just stares until the author gives in. The author includes a picture, which I can't see, but the context suggests it's about the friend taking from their plate.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend isn't paying for groceries or bills. The author is providing food for both. The friend's behavior of taking without asking could be seen as taking advantage. The author is within their rights to not share if they don't want to, especially since the friend isn't contributing financially. However, the friend might feel entitled due to being best friends. But the author is setting boundaries by not always giving in. The friend's passive-aggressive behavior (staring instead of asking) isn't respectful. The author isn't wrong for not sharing; they're maintaining their own needs and boundaries. The friend's lack of contribution and the way they take food without asking suggest they're in the wrong. So, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
