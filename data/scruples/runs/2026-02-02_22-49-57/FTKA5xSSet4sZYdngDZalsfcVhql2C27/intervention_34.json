He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay for anything, including groceries. The friend sometimes is loud, dirty, and smelly, but the author puts up with it because of friendship. Now, the friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, even though there's enough food, but not the same type. The author usually gives in, but the friend just stares until they do.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend isn't contributing to the household expenses, which is a red flag. The author is covering all the costs, so maybe the expectation is different. However, when it comes to sharing food, it's about personal choice. If the author made enough for both, but not the same type, maybe the friend is expecting to have the same meal. But the author isn't obligated to share their specific meal if they made it for themselves. The friend's behavior of staring to pressure the author is also problematic. It's about consent and personal space. The author is in the right to say no, especially if they're not comfortable. Plus, the friend's lack of contribution makes it even more a personal choice. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here. So the answer is B.\n"
