He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. So, the scenario is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses their car, and now the friend wants a portion of their meals. The author usually gives in but is now questioning if they're wrong for not sharing sometimes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially to the household, which might be a point. The author is making sure there's enough food, but not always the same type. The friend is taking portions without being asked, using a stare to pressure the author. \n\nThe key here is consent and boundaries. If the friend is not asking and just taking, that's a problem. The author has the right to set boundaries about their own food. Even though they're friends, personal space and possessions matter. Also, the friend isn't contributing to the expenses, so maybe the author isn't obligated to share their meals. However, the author has been making sure there's enough food, so maybe there's an unspoken agreement to share. But if the friend is pressuring them with a stare, that's pushy. The author might feel uncomfortable. \n\nIs it wrong not to share? Well, if the author isn't being asked and the friend is just taking, then the author isn't wrong to say no. They should be able to set limits. Also, considering that the friend isn't contributing, maybe the author isn't responsible for their meals. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in could be manipulative. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing. They can decide how they want to handle their own food. The answer should be B, No.\n"
