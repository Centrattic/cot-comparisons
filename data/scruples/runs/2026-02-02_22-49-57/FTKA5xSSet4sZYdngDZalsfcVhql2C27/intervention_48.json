He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them, doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and often wants a portion of the author's meals. The author usually gives in but sometimes doesn't, and the friend just stares until they do.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is living for free, not contributing to expenses, and now is asking for food. The author mentions they ensure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The main issue is the friend's expectation to get a portion of the author's meal, using silent pressure. \n\nThe key points are: the friend isn't contributing financially, the author is providing food, but the friend's behavior is manipulative. The author is setting a boundary by sometimes not giving in, which is a reasonable action to take. The friend's approach of staring until the author complies is a form of passive-aggressive behavior. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's decision to not always share their meal is a boundary setting. Since the friend isn't contributing, the author isn't obligated to share. The fact that the author already ensures there's food for both suggests they are being considerate, but the friend's insistence on getting the same food is unfair. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are justified in setting boundaries, especially when the friend isn't contributing. The friend's behavior is the issue here, not the author's refusal to share when they choose to.\n"
