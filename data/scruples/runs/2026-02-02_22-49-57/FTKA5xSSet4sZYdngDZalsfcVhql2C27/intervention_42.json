He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and uses their car. The friend often wants a portion of their meal, and the author sometimes gives in but sometimes doesn't. The friend just stares until they comply.\n\nHmm, first, the friend isn't contributing financially at all. That's a big point. If they're living for free, maybe the author feels it's unfair to share their meals. The author mentions making sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. So maybe the friend is getting some food, but not the specific meals the author is eating. The friend's behavior of staring until they get food might be seen as manipulative or taking advantage. \n\nOn the other hand, they are best friends, so the author might feel obligated to share. But if the friend isn't contributing to the household expenses, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The author is not in the wrong if they decide to stop sharing because they have the right to control their own meals. The friend's actions are more about taking without giving back. \n\nI think the key here is the lack of financial responsibility from the friend. The author can't be expected to share everything when the friend isn't helping out. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
