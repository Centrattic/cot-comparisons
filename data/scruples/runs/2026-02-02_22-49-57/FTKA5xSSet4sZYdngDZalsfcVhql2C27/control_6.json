He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or groceries, and uses their car. The friend often wants a portion of the food the author eats, even though there's supposedly enough food for both. The author sometimes gives in but not always, and the friend just stares until they comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is living for free, not contributing financially. The author is covering all the bills, groceries, and transportation. The friend's behavior of wanting a portion of the meal every time could be seen as taking advantage. The author is trying to set boundaries by not sharing, but the friend uses silent pressure. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that since they're the one providing, they have the right to decide how to eat their own food. However, the friend's expectation might stem from a sense of shared living. But the friend isn't contributing, which complicates things. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author always ensures there's enough food for both, maybe the friend's request is reasonable. But the author isn't sharing the same type of food, which could indicate they're stretching resources. The friend's behavior of staring until they get what they want is manipulative and could be considered inconsiderate. \n\nThe key points are the friend's lack of contribution and the pressure tactics. The author is maintaining boundaries, which is their right. The friend's actions might be exploiting the situation. So the author isn't wrong for not sharing, especially since the friend isn't contributing to the household. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
