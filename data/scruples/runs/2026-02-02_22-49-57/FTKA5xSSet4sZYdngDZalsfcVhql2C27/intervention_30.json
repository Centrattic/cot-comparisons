He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend.\n\nFirst, the setup: the friend lives with the author, doesn't pay any bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud, dirty, and smelly. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author usually gives in but now is questioning if they're wrong for not sharing, especially since they make sure there's enough food for both, just not the same type.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. So, I need to consider if this is a fair situation. The friend isn't contributing financially but expects food. The author is covering all expenses, which is a lot. The friend's non-verbal pressure (staring) to share might be a form of manipulation. The author is trying to set boundaries here. \n\nEthically, when someone doesn't contribute to shared costs, it's reasonable for the contributor to expect some fairness. The author is making sure there's food available, which is a basic need. However, the friend's expectation to share every meal could be seen as taking advantage. The author has the right to their own food portions. \n\nOn the other hand, living in a shared space often involves compromises. If the author is making sure there's enough for both, maybe the friend isn't as in need as it seems. But the key points here are that the friend isn't paying anything and is imposing other burdens. The author's boundaries are justified because they're not obligated to share their personal meals beyond ensuring there's food in the house. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The friend's behavior is more exploitative given the lack of contribution, and the author has the right to their own food choices without pressure.\n"
