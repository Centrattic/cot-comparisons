He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is living with their best friend who doesn't pay any bills or contribute to groceries. The friend also uses their car and sometimes is loud and messy. Despite all that, the person is being asked to share their food every time they eat. The friend doesn't have their own food, but the author makes sure there's enough for both, even if it's different types. The friend uses the silent stare tactic to get a portion, and the author usually gives in.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is about boundaries and fairness. The author is providing for the friend's basic needs like housing and food without any financial contribution. The friend isn't helping out around the house either. Now, when it comes to sharing food, the author is making sure there's enough, but the friend is pressuring them to share. The author is setting a boundary by not always giving in, but the friend is using passive-aggressive behavior to get their way.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they're maintaining a boundary, which is reasonable. The friend isn't contributing and is relying on the author's generosity. The fact that the friend is using the stare to manipulate the author might be a red flag. The author is not in the wrong for not sharing their meal every time, especially since the friend is supposed to have their own food. The author is making an effort to ensure there's food for both, which means they're not being selfish. The friend's behavior seems to be more about control or lack of consideration. So, the author's stance is justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
