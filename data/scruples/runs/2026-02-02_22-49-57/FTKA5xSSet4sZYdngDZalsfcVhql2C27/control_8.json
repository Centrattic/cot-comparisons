He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or groceries, and uses their car. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of their meal every time they eat, and the writer sometimes gives in but not always.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend doesn't contribute financially, which might make the writer feel like they're shouldering all the responsibilities. Sharing food might be an additional burden if the writer is already covering all the costs. The friend's behavior of asking for a portion each time could be seen as taking more than their share, especially since the writer mentions making sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. So maybe the writer is trying to manage resources based on their own preferences or needs.\n\nThen, the friend's actions: staring until the writer gives in. That's passive-aggressive and could be manipulative. The writer is trying to set boundaries by not always giving in, which might be necessary for their own well-being. They're dealing with a friend who has other issues like being loud, dirty, and smelly, yet they tolerate that. The main question is about the food sharing. \n\nIs the writer wrong for not sharing? If the friend is contributing nothing else, maybe the writer isn't obligated to share their food. Personal space and personal choices about meals should be respected. The friend's expectation of getting a portion every time without contributing might be unreasonable. The writer is asserting their right to decide what they eat without pressure. \n\nOn the other hand, since they're roommates, there's an unspoken social contract to be considerate. But if the friend isn't contributing, the balance is off. The writer might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially when the friend isn't respecting their limits by staring and pressuring them. \n\nSo, considering all that, the writer isn't in the wrong. They're managing their own choices and dealing with an unbalanced relationship. The friend's behavior is more problematic. So the answer is B.\n"
