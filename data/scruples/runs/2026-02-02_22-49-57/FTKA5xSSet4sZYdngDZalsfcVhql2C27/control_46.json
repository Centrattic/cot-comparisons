He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they live with their best friend who doesn't pay any bills or groceries. The friend is living there for free and uses the author's car. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend just stares until the author gives in, which they usually do.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a big point. The author is covering all expenses, so maybe there's an underlying issue of fairness. The friend is taking without giving, which might be causing resentment. Now, when it comes to sharing food, the author is being asked to give their meal, which they often do. But the question is whether that's the author's fault.\n\nOn one hand, the friend is relying on the author's generosity. If the author is making food, maybe they should have set boundaries from the start. But the friend isn't paying for the food, so expecting the author to share everything might be unfair. The author might feel like they're being taken advantage of. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in could be manipulative, which isn't healthy.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author chose to live with this friend and has accepted their habits (loudness, being dirty). Maybe they should have had a conversation about expectations when they moved in. However, the fact that the friend isn't contributing financially makes the situation more about the imbalance in the living arrangement. The author isn't obligated to share their meals, especially if they're paying for everything else. The friend's demand for food portions might be crossing a line, and the author has the right to say no without feeling guilty.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing their food. The friend is not contributing and is imposing their needs without considering the author's contributions and personal space. The author should set boundaries, and not sharing their meal is a reasonable boundary. Therefore, the answer is B."
