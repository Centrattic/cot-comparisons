He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them for free, doesn't pay bills or groceries, and uses the author's car. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meals, sometimes staring until the author gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, so the author is covering all expenses. That already creates a potential imbalance. The author is making sure there's enough food for both, but the friend is asking for the same type, not just any available food. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in seems manipulative.\n\nThe key point here is consent and boundaries. The author isn't obligated to share their personal meals, especially if they prepared them specifically. The friend's actions might be seen as taking without asking properly, which can be disrespectful. However, the author might feel guilty because they care about the friend's well-being.\n\nBut then, the friend isn't contributing to the household, so the author might be overextending themselves. The fact that the author usually gives in despite their discomfort suggests they feel pressured. The friend's behavior could be seen as taking advantage of the author's kindness.\n\nI should also consider cultural or social norms. In some contexts, sharing food is expected, but when someone isn't contributing, it's fair to set boundaries. The author is setting a boundary by saying no sometimes, which is their right. The friend's reaction (staring until the author gives in) isn't healthy communication.\n\nOverall, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their need to keep their own food. The issue lies with the friend's expectations and lack of contribution. The author has the right to decide how they use their resources, especially since they're the one paying for everything.\n"
