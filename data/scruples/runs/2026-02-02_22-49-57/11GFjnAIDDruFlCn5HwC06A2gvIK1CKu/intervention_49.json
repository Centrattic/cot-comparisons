I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to think through this. The person wrote about proposing on a cruise with a big setup, and the girlfriend said yes but later changed her mind. The author is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, the main issue is the proposal method. The guy planned it publicly without discussing the engagement first. The ex said she wasn't ready and moving too fast. So, maybe the problem is that he didn't have that conversation beforehand. Proposing is a big step, and expecting a \"yes\" without talking about the future commitment could be an issue. \n\nHe mentions she didn't want to marry him after the proposal. She might have been pressured into saying yes in the moment because of the setup. The guy is upset she changed her mind, but maybe she felt forced. The ex's reaction was that he moved too fast, which is a valid concern. So, is the guy at fault for not discussing engagement plans before the proposal? \n\nAlso, he ended the relationship right then because he felt she was insensitive. But was that the right move? Maybe their communication was lacking on the big life decision. The guy's actions might have contributed to the problem by not checking in with her first. \n\nIn relationships, major decisions usually require discussion. If he hadn't set up a public proposal without talking about it, perhaps they could have had a more thoughtful conversation. So maybe he did have some responsibility here. But then again, she changed her mind after the commitment, which is also a problem. \n\nI'm torn. On one hand, he didn't communicate properly. On the other, she didn't clarify her feelings before saying yes. But the question is, is he in the wrong? If the main issue is that he didn't discuss engagement plans first, then yes, he might be. But if the problem is her changing her mind, then maybe not. \n\nI think the key is that proposing without prior discussion about commitment can lead to misunderstandings. So the answer might be A, he's in the wrong. But some might say she should have been honest earlier. But the question is about the author's fault. So, AITA? The answer likely splits, but the user thinks the author isn't wrong. But I need to decide based on the analysis. Hmm.\n"
