She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he proposed during a cruise with a big setup, she said yes, but then changed her mind. He was really hurt and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on. She said it was his fault for not discussing engagement first and moving too fast.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with her. That's a big step. Maybe he should have talked to her about his intentions beforehand to make sure she was on the same page. Proposing can be a huge commitment, and doing it publicly might add pressure. She might have felt caught off guard, even if she initially said yes. Then she realized she wasn't ready for marriage, which is a significant life decision.\n\nOn the other hand, she said yes and then changed her mind. That's really hurtful. It's possible she wasn't ready emotionally, but after saying yes, retracting it without discussing could be seen as insensitivity. However, maybe she had valid reasons she didn't realize until after the proposal. But she did mention they were moving too quickly. So perhaps the root issue is communication.\n\nThe key points are whether the author should have discussed the proposal beforehand and whether her reaction was justified. If he didn't talk to her about wanting to get engaged, maybe he didn't respect her need for more time. But she also had a chance to say no earlier if she wasn't ready. Ending the relationship because she changed her mind after saying yes might be his way of protecting himself from further hurt, but it's also a big decision. \n\nIn terms of accountability, it's a bit of a shared responsibility. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't discuss the proposal first, he might have contributed to the problem. However, her retracting the \"yes\" without being upfront also plays a role. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on proposals. In some perspectives, a proposal is a joint decision, so maybe he should have checked with her first. But she also didn't clarify her feelings in time. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be somewhat at fault for not discussing the proposal, but she also shares responsibility. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the community typically sides more on communication before proposals, then answer A. Otherwise, if the focus is on her retracting the yes, then B. I think the general advice is to discuss engagement before proposing, so maybe A is the answer here. But it's a bit of a toss-up. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B because she was insensitve in retracting her yes. But I'm leaning towards A because he didn't talk to her first, which led to the situation.\n"
