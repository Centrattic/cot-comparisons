      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that went from \"yes\" to no. The user proposed on a cruise, set up a big event with a photographer, got a \"yes,\" then later the girlfriend said she didn't actually want to marry him. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The proposer might have done things impulsively without discussing the engagement first. Proposing is a big step, and maybe they didn't talk about their readiness for marriage. The girlfriend said she wasn't ready, so maybe the proposal was too sudden for her. On the other hand, after saying \"yes,\" retracting it is really hurtful. She might feel pressured in the moment but wasn't ready emotionally. The proposer was excited and then devastated, which is understandable. But breaking up over her not wanting to marry him after the proposal could be his decision. \n\nIs the proposer at fault for not discussing the engagement first? Maybe. A good relationship should involve communication about major life decisions. If he didn't have that conversation, he might have assumed she was ready. However, the girlfriend could have also expressed her feelings before the proposal. Retracting her acceptance is also a problem because once someone says \"yes,\" it's a commitment. But if she felt pressured, that's another issue. \n\nThe key points are: Did the proposer act without proper discussion? Yes, which could be a mistake. Did the girlfriend not communicate her feelings? Also a possibility. But after accepting the proposal, changing her mind is hurtful. The user ended the relationship, which might be his choice, but is he in the wrong? The question is whether he's at fault. \n\nI think both could share some responsibility. The proposer didn't discuss the engagement, leading to her feeling blindsided, which is a mistake. However, her retracting the \"yes\" is also a significant issue. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I'd say there's fault on his part for not having the conversation first. So answer A.\n"
