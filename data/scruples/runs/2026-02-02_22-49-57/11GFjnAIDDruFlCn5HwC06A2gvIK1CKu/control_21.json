      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who proposed and then got dumped after the acceptance is in the wrong. The situation is that he planned a public proposal, she said yes, but then changed her mind. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The proposer set up a big, public proposal without discussing it with her first, which she found to be moving too fast. She said yes initially but then realized she wasn't ready. He felt betrayed that she didn't communicate her hesitation before the proposal. She, on the other hand, might have felt pressured by the public nature of the proposal and wasn't truly ready for marriage.\n\nPublic proposals can be a big deal. Some people might find them exciting, others might feel pressured. The key issue here is whether the proposer should have discussed the proposal and the idea of marriage more thoroughly before making such a public commitment. If they hadn't had that conversation, maybe he didn't give her a chance to express her feelings about marriage before the proposal. \n\nOn the other hand, she said yes and then changed her mind. That's a big shift. But she might have been overwhelmed in the moment and later realized she wasn't ready. The proposer might feel that after a \"yes,\" her change of heart was hurtful and insincere, especially after the emotional commitment he made. \n\nHe ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity. That's a strong reaction, but if he felt that her initial acceptance was a lie and she didn't communicate her true feelings, maybe he's justified in ending things. However, the root cause might be his own lack of communication before the proposal. \n\nSo, is the proposer in the wrong? If he didn't discuss the proposal and the idea of marriage beforehand, he might have contributed to the misunderstanding. She might have felt pressured into saying yes in the moment. But after she changed her mind, his response was to end the relationship, which could be seen as fair if he felt she was insincere. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If the problem was that he didn't talk about marriage first, then maybe he's partially at fault. But if she changed her mind after agreeing, that's on her. However, the fact that she said yes and then changed her mind could be seen as her being insensitive, but maybe she had valid reasons. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, some people might think that a public proposal should be discussed beforehand. If he didn't check in with her about her feelings on marriage before planning the proposal, he might have rushed things. But she also had the opportunity to say no or express hesitation during the proposal. \n\nOverall, the proposer might share some responsibility for not discussing the proposal first, but the ex's decision to change her mind after accepting seems to be the main issue. However, the user is asking if the proposer is in the wrong. The answer could be that he's not (B) because she changed her mind after accepting, but there's a nuance here. If he had discussed the proposal beforehand, maybe the situation could have been avoided. But since he didn't, he might be partially at fault. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not if both are at fault. \n\nGiven that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the main issue was her changing her mind after accepting. But I'm not entirely sure. Another perspective is that he was wrong for not discussing the proposal with her first, leading to her feeling pressured. That could make him partially at fault, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up. However, since she changed her mind after agreeing, which is a significant betrayal, maybe he's justified in ending the relationship, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
