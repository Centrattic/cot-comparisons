      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when his girlfriend took back her \"yes\" after a proposal during a cruise. The setup is that he planned a public proposal without discussing it with her first, she said yes, then later changed her mind, and he ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author planned the proposal without prior discussion. Even though he was excited, not talking about the engagement first might have been a mistake. Proposing without discussing the future together could lead to misunderstandings. The girlfriend then had a change of heart after the proposal, which hurt him. She gave a reason that they were moving too fast, which he didn't agree with, and he ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and expectations around proposals. Traditionally, a proposal is a big step, and it's usually expected that both partners have discussed marriage before that. If he didn't talk about engagement plans, maybe he didn't set the right expectations. However, she did say yes initially, which is a commitment. Then changing her mind after the fact is problematic. But her reasoning is that they were moving too fast, which is her right to feel. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he felt led on because she didn't say no beforehand. He might believe that once she said yes, she should stick with it. On the other hand, she might have felt pressured by the public proposal and wasn't ready, leading her to withdraw her acceptance. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? If he didn't discuss the engagement first, that could be seen as rushing into something without her input. However, once she said yes, retracting that could be hurtful. The question is whether the author's actions (ending the relationship) were justified. He might be in the right because he felt betrayed by her change of heart, but if he didn't have the conversation beforehand, he might share some responsibility. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she's the one in the wrong for changing her mind after accepting. But she had the right to realize she wasn't ready. The key issue here is communication. The author didn't discuss the engagement plans with her, and she didn't communicate her feelings about moving forward before the proposal. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, it's a bit of a grey area. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he didn't check in with her about engagement plans, that's a problem. But after she said yes, retracting it is also problematic. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering that the woman changed her mind after accepting, which can be really hurtful, but the author didn't discuss the proposal with her first. The answer might depend on the perspective. However, in many cases, retracting a \"yes\" to marriage is seen as a major issue, so the woman might be in the wrong. But if the author didn't have that conversation, maybe he's partially at fault. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). If the author didn't discuss the proposal, he might be in the wrong for not checking in. However, after the proposal, the woman's actions led to the breakup. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the woman's refusal to acknowledge the proposal's impact makes her at fault, but the author's decision to end the relationship because of her insensitivity might be justified. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. The answer could go either way, but the key is whether the author is in the wrong. If he didn't discuss engagement plans, that's his fault. But if she changed her mind after accepting, that's her fault. The question is about the author's responsibility. So, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't have the conversation first, leading to the misunderstanding. Or B (not in the wrong) because she retracted her acceptance, which is worse. \n\nI think in typical AITA scenarios, retracting a \"yes\" is a big no, so the woman is in the wrong. But the author's approach might have contributed. However, the main issue here is her taking back her yes. So, the author is not in the wrong because she's the one who changed her mind insensitively. Therefore, answer B.\n"
