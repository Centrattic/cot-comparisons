      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the person proposed during a cruise with a photographer, and the girlfriend (now possibly ex) said yes, but later changed her mind. The conflict arises because the author ended the relationship, blaming her for insensitivity, while she claims it was the author's fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement first.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author set up a public proposal, which the girlfriend felt was premature. She said yes but later decided she wasn't ready to marry. The author is hurt and ended the relationship, while she thinks the problem was his lack of communication about moving too fast.\n\nIn these situations, a lot depends on communication. Proposing is a big step, and if the girlfriend didn't feel ready, the author might have assumed they were on the same page. However, the way the proposal was handled\u2014public and without prior discussion\u2014could be a significant issue. The girlfriend might have felt pressured, especially if it was a surprise. She accepted but then realized she wasn't ready, leading to the rejection. \n\nBut from the author's perspective, he was excited and thought she was in love and ready. The fact that she didn't want to follow through after accepting his proposal in front of others is seen as insensitivity. However, the girlfriend's argument is that the proposal was rushed and not discussed privately first, which is a valid point. People often have different expectations and readiness levels, and a public proposal might make someone feel like they can't say no without embarrassment.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He didn't consider her readiness and pushed for a public proposal without discussing it. He might have misread her signals, thinking she was ready when she wasn't. Ending the relationship because she changed her mind after accepting could be seen as harsh, but he's also hurt and upset. On the other hand, she could have communicated her feelings before accepting, which might have prevented the heartbreak. \n\nBut the core issue here is communication. The author didn't talk to her about the proposal and whether she was ready. Public proposals can be romantic, but they can also create pressure. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she needed more time and a private discussion. The author's decision to end the relationship might be a response to her insensitivity, but he's also responsible for not having that conversation beforehand. \n\nIn many relationships, major steps like marriage should be discussed thoroughly. The author might be in the wrong for not checking in with her before the proposal. However, the girlfriend's acceptance followed by a change of heart could be seen as leading him on, but she might have been caught off guard. \n\nI think the answer is a bit of both, but since the options are only A or B, I need to decide. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend said yes but later changed her mind, that's her doing. But if the author didn't consider her readiness and pressured her into a public proposal, he might share some responsibility. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's refusal to acknowledge the impact of her actions (insensitivity) and the fact that she accepted before changing her mind could make her the one at fault. The author ended the relationship, which is his right, but his justification might be flawed if he didn't initiate the conversation. \n\nBut the main point is that he didn't discuss the proposal with her first. That's a mistake. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate properly before proposing, leading to the situation. The girlfriend's actions after accepting are her own, but the setup was the author's responsibility.\n"
