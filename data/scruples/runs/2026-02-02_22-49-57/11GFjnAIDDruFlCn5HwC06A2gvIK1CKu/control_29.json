I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is he proposed on a cruise with a big setup, she said yes, then changed her mind. He was really hurt and ended the relationship. She said it was his fault for not discussing it beforehand and moving too fast.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. He planned a public proposal, which is a big step. Maybe she felt pressured or surprised. She might not have realized it was going to be that public. But she did say yes initially, then changed her mind. That's confusing. Why didn't she just say no in the moment instead of leading him on?\n\nOn the other hand, proposing is a huge commitment. If they hadn't discussed engagement before, maybe he should have checked in with her first. Public proposals can be overwhelming. Some people might feel they have to say something in the moment, even if they're not sure. So maybe he didn't communicate well enough. But she didn't clarify her feelings either. \n\nHe ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. Is ending it justified? He was heartbroken. But maybe he could have handled it differently. She might have been scared or unsure. Her reaction of getting upset and blaming him for moving too fast suggests she wasn't ready. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he didn't discuss the proposal with her first, that's a mistake. Proposing without having that serious conversation could have led to her feeling pressured. But she also changed her mind after saying yes, which is confusing and hurtful. \n\nSo maybe both are a little in the wrong. But the question is specifically about the author. Did he do something wrong by proposing without discussing it? Possibly. However, she could have been honest if she wasn't ready. The answer might depend on cultural expectations or relationship norms. In some views, proposing is okay even if not discussed, but others might see it as jumping the gun. \n\nI think the key point is that he didn't talk to her about the proposal first. If they were serious, they should have had that conversation. So he's partly at fault. But she's also at fault for changing her mind. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the answer is A or B, and the options are Yes (he's wrong) or No (not wrong). Given that he didn't discuss it first, which is a significant oversight, but maybe it's not entirely his fault. But the answer options are A or B, so I need to pick one. Maybe the answer is A, he is in the wrong, because he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand. But others might say she's equally at fault. Hmm.\n"
