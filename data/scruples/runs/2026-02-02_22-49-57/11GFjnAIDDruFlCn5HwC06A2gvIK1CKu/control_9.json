      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a proposal that went wrong.\n\nFirst, the author planned a public proposal on a cruise without discussing it with his girlfriend first. She said \"yes\" but then changed her mind, leading to a breakup. The author feels she was insensitive by leading him on and not being ready, while she argues that he moved too quickly without talking about engagement first.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The author's mistake was proposing without discussing the engagement first. Proposals usually involve a mutual understanding between partners. By not having that conversation, he might have sprung it on her, making her feel pressured. She then said yes on the spot but later realized she wasn't ready. That's a tough spot for both.\n\nBut then, after she changed her mind, the author ended the relationship, accusing her of insensitivity. Her argument is valid because the proposal was public and unexpected. If they hadn't talked about engagement, he might have assumed she was okay with moving forward, but she wasn't prepared. However, once she changed her mind, how he handled it matters. Ending the relationship immediately might have been hasty, but he felt betrayed. \n\nThe key points are: he proposed without discussing it first, which could have been a mistake. She didn't communicate her feelings clearly after saying yes. Both acted based on their own pressures and emotions. However, the initial proposal without discussion is a point where the author could be at fault. But the way both reacted\u2014her changing her mind and his quick breakup\u2014each has their own issues. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the question is whether the author is wrong. Since he didn't discuss the proposal first, that's a misstep. But her changing her mind after a public \"yes\" is also problematic. However, the user is asking specifically about the author's fault. The answer might lean towards the author being partially at fault for the proposal setup. But the community might say it's a 50-50 situation. However, the options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). Given that, I think the answer is B (he's not in the wrong) because while he could have discussed it more, her behavior was also insensitivity. But the question is about the author's fault. Maybe the main issue is her changing her mind after saying yes, which is worse. So the answer might be B.\n"
