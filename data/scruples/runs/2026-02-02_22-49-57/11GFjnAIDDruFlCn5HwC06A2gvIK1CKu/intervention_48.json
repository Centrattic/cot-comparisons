      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a proposal gone wrong. The guy planned a big public proposal on a cruise, set up with a photographer, and the girl said yes. Then later, she changed her mind and didn't want to marry him. The guy feels hurt and broke up with her, saying she was insensitive. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of both parties. The man planned a proposal without discussing it with his girlfriend first. He went ahead and made it public, which might have been a surprise. The woman initially said yes, but then changed her mind. She argues that the man moved too fast and didn't discuss the engagement plans with her. The man is upset because she led him on.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1. Did the man handle the proposal correctly by not discussing it first? 2. Did the woman have the right to change her mind after saying yes? 3. Who is more at fault here?\n\nTraditionally, in some cultures, a proposal is seen as a commitment, and saying yes is a binding agreement. However, in modern relationships, people might have different views. The woman claims she wasn't ready, so she changed her mind. But she didn't clarify this before or after the initial \"yes.\" The man might feel betrayed because she didn't communicate her feelings earlier.\n\nThe man's mistake could be not discussing the proposal with her first. Public proposals can be stressful and might not allow for open communication beforehand. However, the woman's response of changing her mind after saying yes could be seen as insensitive too. She might not have considered the emotional impact of her change of heart.\n\nIn terms of fault, the question is whether one party is more at fault. The man's action was to surprise her without prior discussion, which could be seen as not respecting her readiness. The woman's reaction was to change her answer without addressing the issue immediately. \n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to consider if the man's actions were indeed wrong. If he didn't consult her on the proposal, maybe that's a misstep. But if she then went back on her word without explanation, that's also a problem. However, the woman's reasoning is that the man moved too fast, so she wasn't ready. So, the man's approach might have contributed to the problem. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author (the man) is the one who proposed without discussing. However, the woman didn't communicate her feelings before or after. So, it's possible that both are at fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is B (No), then the man isn't in the wrong. But if there's a split responsibility, maybe the answer could be A. However, the man ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. \n\nIn the end, maybe the man isn't in the wrong because the woman didn't communicate her feelings, but his approach of not discussing the proposal first might have contributed. But the woman's refusal to acknowledge his feelings and her changing her mind without communication could be worse. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. But I'm a bit confused because both have some fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is B, then the man isn't in the wrong. If A, then he is. But I think the main issue is the woman's actions leading to the change of heart without communication. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
