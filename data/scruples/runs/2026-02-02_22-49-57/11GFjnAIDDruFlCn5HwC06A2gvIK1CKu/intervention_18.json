      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong after his girlfriend (now ex) took back her \"yes\" to his proposal. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author planned a public proposal on a cruise, with a photographer and everything. She said yes, they celebrated, but later she changed her mind. He felt broken, cried, and ended the relationship because he thought she was insensitive. She blamed him for moving too quickly and not discussing engagement first.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the public proposal setup, her initial acceptance and then backing out, the emotional response from both sides, and the reasons each gave. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he felt betrayed because she led him on. He might think that once she said yes, she was committed, so changing her mind was unfair. His reaction of ending the relationship shows he felt she wasn't honest or considerate.\n\nOn her side, she said the problem was that he didn't discuss engagement first. She felt they were moving too fast. So she might have thought it was important to have that conversation before a proposal, especially a public one. Her actions of taking back her \"yes\" could be because she realized she wasn't ready after the proposal, but he felt she should have communicated that earlier.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author didn't discuss the proposal with her beforehand, which she found problematic. Public proposals can be stressful; maybe she felt pressured. However, once she said yes, changing her mind after the fact could be seen as not being honest. But maybe she wasn't in the right frame of mind during the proposal. \n\nIs the author at fault for not talking about engagement first? That seems like a valid point she made. Proposing without discussing it might have been a misstep. But once she accepted, retracting could be hurtful. Did she have the right to take back her answer? That's a tricky part. If she wasn't ready, maybe she should have said no, but once she said yes, changing her mind adds emotional pain.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But from a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author's failure to discuss engagement could be a fault. However, her changing her mind after accepting might also be a fault. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some. The author could be blamed for not checking in with her about the proposal plans, and she for not being clear about her readiness. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong specifically. \n\nGiven that he ended the relationship because she was insensitive, but she had a valid reason about moving too fast. The author's reaction of ending it might be justified if he felt betrayed, but the root cause was his actions. \n\nSo, considering both sides, maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong (A) because he didn't communicate his proposal plans with her first, leading to her feeling pressured. However, her retracting her \"yes\" is also problematic. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the main issue is the public proposal without prior discussion. Hence, A might be the answer. But maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that once she accepted, she should have been committed, but that's not always the case. So if the author is to blame for not discussing it, then he is in the wrong. But others might say that she should have been honest at the time. \n\nI think the key here is that the author didn't have that conversation first, which she found important. So he shares some responsibility. Therefore, the answer could be A. But others might say she was wrong to take it back. \n\nHmm. This is a tough one. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on which action is more blameworthy. If the author is wrong for not discussing the proposal first, then A. If she's wrong for retracting her yes, then B. Since the user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to decide. \n\nMaybe the answer is A because the public proposal without prior discussion is a significant issue, and that led to her backing out. He could have been more considerate of her feelings by discussing it first. Therefore, he's partly at fault. So, answer A.\n"
