We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking whether the author is at fault in this situation. The author proposed during a cruise, set up a big public proposal with a photographer. The girlfriend said yes, but then later changed her mind. The author feels hurt and ends the relationship because he thinks she led him on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a proposal without discussing it first. Maybe that was a mistake. Proposing can be a big step, and not talking about it beforehand might have caused the problem. The girlfriend said they were moving too fast and she wasn't ready. So she might have felt pressured or surprised by the sudden proposal. She says it's the author's fault for not discussing engagement first. That's a valid point because open communication is important in relationships, especially about such a significant decision.\n\nThen, after the proposal, she changed her mind. The author is hurt and ends the relationship. He feels she was insensitive. But she might have felt overwhelmed by the public proposal, which could have added pressure. Maybe she realized in that moment that she wasn't ready, and her initial \"yes\" was a reaction to the moment rather than a thoughtful decision. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction is understandable. He went through the emotional rollercoaster of planning the proposal, getting rejected, and then ending the relationship. But he did plan the proposal without discussing it, which could be seen as not respecting her input. However, after she changed her mind, his response was to end things, which might be harsh, but given the hurt, maybe justified.\n\nSo, who's at fault? The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he didn't discuss the proposal first, that's a point against him. But the girlfriend changed her mind after saying yes, which is also a problem. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but the answer depends on whether the failure to discuss the proposal was the main issue. Maybe the author is partially at fault for not having the conversation, but the girlfriend is also responsible for her indecision. However, since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, if the main issue is the lack of prior discussion, then answer A (yes, he's wrong). But if the main issue is the girlfriend's change of heart and insensitivity, then answer B (he's not wrong). It's a bit of a toss-up. The question is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the main fault is the author's lack of communication, then yes. But if it's the girlfriend's indecision, then no. Since the girlfriend said it was the author's fault for moving too fast, maybe the author did have some responsibility. But the user's perspective is that the author isn't wrong. So I need to decide based on the details. I think the key point is that the author didn't discuss the proposal first, which is a common advice in relationships. So maybe answer A. But the girlfriend also changed her mind, which complicates things. Hmm.\n"
