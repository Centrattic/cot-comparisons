      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after his girlfriend took back her \"yes\" to his proposal. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The author planned a public proposal on a cruise, set up with a photographer, and she initially said yes. They celebrated with champagne and pictures, then later she changed her mind, saying she wasn't ready. He felt betrayed, cried, and ended the relationship, thinking she was insensitive. She, on the other hand, claims the problem was that he planned the proposal without discussing engagement first, leading to them moving too quickly.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The user says the author isn't in the wrong, but they're curious for my take. The answer options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). Let's analyze.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He went through a lot of effort to propose publicly, which is a big step. He was excited, felt happy when she said yes, then devastated when she took it back. He ended things because he felt she was insensitive. His reasoning is that she should have communicated her hesitation earlier instead of letting him get his hopes up.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective: She said yes initially but later changed her mind. She attributes the problem to the author moving too quickly without discussing engagement first. She might feel pressured by the sudden proposal and wasn't ready to commit. Her response is that the issue was the author's lack of prior discussion about marriage.\n\nNow, considering typical relationship dynamics. Proposing is a significant commitment. While it's ideal to discuss marriage intentions before a proposal, not all couples follow that. Some might think a proposal is the natural next step after dating a while. However, the author didn't discuss this with her, which she points out. That could be a contributing factor. But then, when she said yes, she later took it back. That's where it gets complicated. People can change their minds after accepting a proposal, but it's hurtful.\n\nIs the author wrong for ending the relationship over her taking back her yes? Or is he wrong for not discussing engagement first? The key here is whether either party acted inconsiderately. The girlfriend changed her mind after an initial acceptance, which is painful. The author didn't discuss marriage plans first, which might have led to her not being ready. Both could have missteps.\n\nHowever, the author's reaction\u2014ending the relationship because he felt she was insensitive\u2014might be valid if he felt misled. But she did say yes, so maybe her taking it back was her own change of heart, not leading him on. The argument is about expectations: the author expected a commitment after the proposal, and she later realized it wasn't what she wanted. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a gray area. Both might have made mistakes. The author didn't talk about marriage plans first, which could have been a step she wasn't ready for. She then changed her mind after accepting, which is difficult. However, she did initially agree, so maybe she's not entirely at fault. The author's decision to end things might be justified if he felt betrayed, but it's also possible he could have given her more time to process.\n\nBut according to the options, the answer has to be A or B. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the user's perspective is that the author isn't wrong, maybe the reasoning is that she took back her acceptance, which is hurtful. However, the author's lack of prior discussion might contribute. But if the proposal was a surprise and she said yes, then changed her mind, maybe the main issue is her change of heart. But the author's reaction to ending the relationship because of her insensitivity\u2014maybe he's right to feel hurt.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the author shouldn't have proposed without discussing it first. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the problem was that he didn't discuss engagement, then maybe he's partially at fault. However, the key point is that she took back her yes after accepting. The author's ending the relationship because of that might be justified. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
