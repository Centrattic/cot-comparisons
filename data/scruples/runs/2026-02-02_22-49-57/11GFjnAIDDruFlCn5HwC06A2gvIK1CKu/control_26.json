      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their girlfriend took back her \"yes\" during a proposal. The scenario is that the author planned a public proposal on a cruise, she said yes, but later changed her mind, leading to a breakup. The author feels she was insensitive and is asking if they are the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author set up a public proposal without discussing it with his partner first. She initially said yes but then backed out, which he took as leading him on. He ended the relationship because he felt hurt and she was inconsiderate. She, on the other hand, said they were moving too fast and he didn't discuss the engagement with her beforehand.\n\nSo, the main issue here is communication. The author didn't talk to his partner about the proposal, which was a major step. Proposing is a significant commitment, and doing it without prior discussion might have left her unprepared. Her change of heart could be because she wasn't ready for the next step, even if she was happy with their relationship. \n\nHowever, once she said yes, retracting it after the fact is also problematic. If she wasn't ready, she should have been honest before agreeing. But the situation is complex because both parties have valid points. The author's action of not discussing the proposal might have contributed to her feeling pressured, while her retracting the acceptance caused emotional harm.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a communication standpoint, he didn't check in with her about their future plans before proposing, which is a key part of relationships. However, her response after saying yes was also hurtful. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both could share some. But the question is specifically about the author's fault. The user is asking if the author is wrong. Since he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, leading to a situation where she felt unprepared, that's a point against him. On the other hand, ending the relationship because she didn't meet his expectations might be a reaction to her actions, but does that make him wrong?\n\nIt's possible that the author is not in the wrong because he acted on his feelings and had the right to propose. However, the way he handled it without prior discussion could be seen as a misstep. But the core of the issue is their differing readiness levels and communication breakdown. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong for not discussing the proposal first, which is a more responsible approach. But since he did propose, and she changed her mind later, it's a bit of a 50-50 situation. But the options are A (author is wrong) or B (not). The answer depends on cultural norms and relationship advice, which often emphasize communication. If the author didn't talk about the engagement before the proposal, that's a mistake. So maybe A is the answer. But then again, his reaction of breaking up because she changed her mind might be justified if he felt betrayed. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. I think the key here is that the author didn't communicate his intent to propose, which is a major step. In relationships, discussing such milestones is important. So by not doing that, he might be at fault. Therefore, the answer would be A. But others might argue that the girl's retraction was the problem. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. So if the author is wrong for not discussing the proposal, then A. If not, then B. Given the advice that communication is key, I'm leaning towards A. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: in many cultures, proposing is a personal decision, but checking with the partner first is wise. Since he didn't do that, leading to her not being ready, he shares the responsibility. Therefore, A.\n"
