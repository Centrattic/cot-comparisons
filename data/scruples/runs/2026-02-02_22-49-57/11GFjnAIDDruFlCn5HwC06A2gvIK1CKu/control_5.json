      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a man who proposed during a cruise, set up a big public proposal with a photographer, and the woman said yes but then changed her mind. He's upset and ended the relationship, saying she's insensitive. She, on the other hand, claims it was his fault for not discussing the proposal first and moving too fast.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with her first. That could be a problem because a proposal is a big step and expecting a yes without prior discussion might not be considerate. The woman felt they were moving too quickly and wasn't ready for marriage, which she should have communicated earlier. But she said yes in the moment and then changed her mind, which also isn't ideal. \n\nThe author's reaction to ending the relationship because of her change of heart might be seen as harsh. However, he felt she was insensitively leading him on. On the other hand, she had the right to realize she wasn't ready. But the way the proposal was sprung on her without prior conversation might have contributed to her not being prepared to commit. \n\nSo, who's at fault? Both parties have some responsibility. The author didn't check in with her about their future plans, and she didn't communicate her feelings about moving quickly. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key point here is that he proposed without discussing the engagement first, which could be seen as a misstep. Public proposals can be overwhelming if not discussed beforehand. \n\nBut then again, she did say yes and then withdrew it, which is also problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the author's actions were the primary cause. Since the woman stated that moving too quickly was the issue, the author's lack of prior discussion is a significant factor. Therefore, he might share some responsibility. \n\nBut in terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework, the community often looks at who has the higher moral ground. The woman changed her mind after saying yes, which is a major issue. However, the author's approach to proposing without prior communication could be the root cause. So, it's a bit of a toss-up. Some might say the author is in the wrong for not discussing their future plans first, leading to a situation where the woman felt pressured or unprepared. Others might argue that the woman's decision to change her mind after acceptance is the bigger issue. \n\nIn the end, the answer hinges on whose actions were more negligent. The author's failure to talk about an engagement before the proposal is a key point. The woman's subsequent change of heart is also a problem, but perhaps the initial mistake was the author's. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being wrong for not discussing it first. However, the woman's reaction and decision to back out also contribute. But since the question is specifically about the author's fault, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his intentions first, leading to her not being ready. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Let me check again. The woman said it was his fault for planning the proposal without discussing engagement. So she's indicating that the problem was his approach. The author argues that she should have told him earlier. If both sides failed to communicate, maybe it's a shared fault. But the AITA framework often sides with the person who did the lesser wrong. However, in this case, the woman changed her mind after yes, which is a major issue, but the author's approach might have caused her to not think it through. So maybe the author is partially at fault for the setup. The answer is A.\n"
