I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after their girlfriend took back her \"yes\" during a proposal on a cruise. The author set up a public proposal with a photographer, she said yes, they celebrated, but then later she changed her mind. He ended the relationship because he felt hurt and she was insensitively leading him on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a public proposal, which is a big step. Maybe he didn't discuss the engagement plans beforehand, which could be a point of contention. The girlfriend said she wasn't ready and moved too fast. She might feel that he didn't give her a chance to express her feelings before the proposal. The author is upset because she took back her yes after they celebrated, which is understandable. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She might have felt pressured by the public proposal without prior discussion. She could have felt that the proposal was rushed, and she wasn't ready. Her reaction of saying yes and then backing out might stem from anxiety or realizing she wasn't ready. However, retracting a \"yes\" after a proposal is a significant action that can cause emotional harm.\n\nThe author's actions: By planning the proposal without discussing it first, he might have assumed she was ready. Public proposals can be overwhelming for some people, and maybe she didn't feel comfortable saying no in front of others. The author's decision to end the relationship because of her insensitivity could be justified if she didn't take his feelings into account, but it's also possible he didn't consider her readiness.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he didn't communicate his plans and expectations before the proposal, that could be his fault. However, her retracting the yes after the fact is also problematic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. Since both have valid points, but the core issue is about communication and readiness, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the author's action of ending the relationship might be seen as a reaction to her insensitivity, so he's not necessarily in the wrong. But maybe he should have discussed the proposal first. The answer could be a mix, but based on the options, the user thinks he's not in the wrong. So, B (No) might be the right choice.\n"
