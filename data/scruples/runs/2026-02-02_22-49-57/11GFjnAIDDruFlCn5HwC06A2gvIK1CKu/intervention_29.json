I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario is about a proposal that went wrong. The author set up a big public proposal during a cruise, including a photographer, and the girlfriend said yes. But later, she changed her mind and didn't want to get married. The author felt hurt, ended the relationship, and is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a surprise proposal, which the girlfriend didn't want. She said it was too public and they were moving too fast. She might feel pressured if the proposal was a surprise without discussing it first. On the other hand, the author thought she was excited about marriage because she said yes, but then she retracted, which caused emotional pain. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't talk to her about proposing before doing it, which she found inappropriate. The girlfriend might have felt that her readiness for marriage wasn't properly discussed. However, after the proposal, she changed her mind, leading to the breakup. \n\nIn terms of fault, both parties might share some responsibility. The author didn't check if she was ready, but the girlfriend didn't clarify her feelings during the proposal. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's action was the surprise proposal, which the girlfriend found too fast. But after she changed her mind, he ended the relationship, which some might see as justified due to the emotional harm.\n\nConsidering typical perspectives on such situations, public proposals without prior discussion can be seen as overreaching if the partner isn't prepared. However, the girlfriend retracting her acceptance is also a significant issue. The author's decision to end the relationship because of her insensitivity might be seen as a reaction to her changing her mind, which could be complex. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on cultural norms and individual expectations. In many cases, not discussing a proposal first can be a mistake, but the girlfriend's actions after accepting are also problematic. But the question is specifically about the author's fault. I think the main issue is the lack of communication before the proposal. If the author had discussed an engagement with her first, this situation might have been avoided. Therefore, the author might share some fault, but the girlfriend's actions after the proposal also contributed. However, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I need to decide if that's correct.\n"
