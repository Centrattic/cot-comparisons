I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a proposal that was accepted but then retracted. The key points here are the proposal setup, the initial acceptance, and the subsequent rejection.\n\nFirst, the author planned a public proposal without discussing it with his girlfriend first. She said yes initially but later changed her mind. The author feels hurt and ended the relationship, blaming her for insensitivity. She, on the other hand, felt they were moving too fast and that the public proposal without prior discussion was the issue.\n\nSo, who's at fault? In relationships, communication is key. The author didn't talk to her about the proposal beforehand, which she found problematic. Public proposals can be romantic, but if one partner prefers a more private discussion, it can lead to misunderstandings. The fact that she changed her mind after saying yes might seem confusing, but maybe she was caught off guard by the public nature of it. \n\nHowever, once she said yes, even if it was a mistake, retracting it after the fact could be hurtful. The author's reaction is understandable given the emotional investment. But she might have felt pressured in the moment. The question is whether the author is wrong for not discussing the proposal first. \n\nFrom a typical relationship perspective, big decisions like marriage should be discussed privately before making a public commitment. By not doing that, the author might have contributed to her feeling that they were moving too fast. But once she said yes, retracting it could be seen as unfair. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author's mistake was not discussing the proposal privately first, but her retracting after the fact is also problematic. However, since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the main issue is his failure to communicate. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't discuss it first. But some might argue that she was insensitive for backing out. However, the initial fault for not having that conversation lies with him.\n"
