She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this scenario. The user is asking if the author is at fault when his girlfriend (now ex) took back her \"yes\" after a public proposal. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. He proposed publicly, set it up with a photographer, and she initially said yes, but later changed her mind. He was very emotional and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFrom her perspective, she might have agreed in the moment due to the pressure of the public setting or surprise. Maybe she wasn't ready for marriage and the sudden proposal made her feel cornered. She could have felt that he didn't communicate enough before the proposal, hence her blaming him for moving too fast.\n\nOn the author's side, he was excited and planned a big proposal, which is a common way people express commitment. However, the problem arises because she didn't actually want to proceed with marriage. He might have assumed her \"yes\" was genuine without discussing the gravity of the commitment beforehand. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Proposals are significant, and while public ones can be a surprise, they still represent a major life decision. If he didn't talk about marriage plans before jumping into the proposal, that could be an issue. However, she gave a \"yes\" and then retracted it. That might indicate she felt pressured, but she could have also been honest immediately. The fact that she waited until after the engagement party (champagne, pictures) to say she didn't want to marry him seems insincere. \n\nThe author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. That's a valid reaction if he felt she led him on. But he might have rushed into the proposal without ensuring mutual readiness. However, her change of heart without immediate clarification seems more problematic. \n\nI think the core issue is communication. Proposing without discussing engagement first could be seen as impulsive, but her retracting the acceptance after a public \"yes\" is also a betrayal of trust. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's some fault on both sides. However, since she changed her mind after agreeing, her insensitivity is more clear. The answer depends on whether the author's actions were reasonable given the relationship's stage. If they were already in a committed relationship and marriage was on the cards, maybe not in the wrong. But if they hadn't discussed marriage plans, then he might be at fault for not talking it over first. The user says he's not in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the details. The key here is her retraction after a public acceptance, which can be hurtful regardless of the reasoning. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. I'll go with B.\n"
