      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong after their girlfriend took back her \"yes\" after a public proposal.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author planned a public proposal on a cruise. The girlfriend said yes, but then later changed her mind. The author felt broken, cried, and ended the relationship because he thinks she was insensitive. She blamed him for moving too fast and not discussing the engagement first.\n\nSo, the main points here are about communication and expectations. The author set up a big, public proposal without talking to her first. She said yes in the moment but wasn't actually ready. He felt led on, and she felt he was rushing things.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, proposing is a big step. Even if it's a public proposal, maybe he didn't talk to her about his intentions beforehand. She might have felt pressured in the moment. However, once she said yes, even if it was a mistake, retracting it after the fact could be hurtful. But the key here is the communication. If he didn't discuss the engagement with her first, he might have made assumptions. On the other hand, once she said yes and then changed her mind, that's her choice. But the fact that she didn't stick to her initial \"yes\" could be seen as insensitivity. However, the author might also be in the wrong for not having that conversation first. So, both sides have some responsibility here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the author is partially at fault for not discussing the proposal with her first, but the girlfriend retracting her \"yes\" is also problematic. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend retracted her commitment after the fact, the author might not be in the wrong. But the initial lack of communication from the author's side could be an issue. However, the girlfriend's actions are also a problem. The user might be looking for a judgment on whether the author did something wrong. If the girlfriend said yes and then changed her mind, the author's reaction is understandable. The answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend didn't follow through. But maybe the author should have discussed the proposal first. However, in many cases, a proposal is a traditional step where the man does it without prior discussion. So maybe the author isn't at fault. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend didn't honor her commitment. But maybe there's a part where the author should have talked about it first. But the key is that the girlfriend took back her yes, which is the main issue. So the answer would be B.\n"
