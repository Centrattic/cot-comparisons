I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong after his girlfriend changed her mind about the proposal.\n\nFirst, the author planned a big public proposal on a cruise. The girlfriend said yes, but then later changed her mind. The author feels hurt and ends the relationship because he thinks she was insincere. She, on the other hand, says the problem was that he didn't discuss the proposal with her first and moved too quickly.\n\nSo, the main points are: public proposal without prior discussion, she changed her mind after accepting, and the author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both perspectives. \n\nFrom the author's side, he put a lot of effort into the proposal, got an enthusiastic yes, and then she retracted it. That's incredibly hurtful. He might feel like she led him on, which is understandable. Ending the relationship because of this is a strong reaction, but given the emotional impact, it's not unreasonable.\n\nOn her side, she might feel that the public proposal was too sudden and that he didn't involve her in the decision-making process. Maybe she wasn't ready for marriage and felt pressured. However, after accepting the proposal, retracting it seems like a betrayal of his trust. Even if she wasn't ready, she should have communicated that before the proposal instead of after.\n\nThe key issue here is communication. The author didn't discuss the proposal with her first, which could have prevented the situation. However, once the proposal was made and accepted, her change of heart caused significant emotional harm. Ending the relationship because she couldn't be honest or follow through on her commitment might be justified from his perspective.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for not discussing the proposal first? Yes, to some extent. Proposing is a major step, and discussing it beforehand is important to ensure both parties are on the same page. However, the immediate retraction after accepting the proposal compounds the problem. \n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the author is not in the wrong. Considering that both parties have some fault, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user's answer might lean towards B (No), but I need to check if there's a stronger case for A or B.\n\nIn the end, while the author made a mistake by not discussing the proposal first, the girlfriend's actions of retracting her acceptance after causing emotional distress seem more egregious. Therefore, the author ending the relationship could be seen as a justified reaction to her insensitivity, making the answer B.\n"
