I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the scenario) is in the wrong. The key points here are the proposal setup, the initial acceptance, and the subsequent retraction.\n\nFirst, the author planned a public proposal during a cruise, complete with a photographer. The girlfriend said yes, but later changed her mind. The author felt betrayed and ended the relationship. The girlfriend's defense was that he moved too quickly without discussing engagement plans first, leading her to feel pressured.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, proposals are significant milestones. The author did plan it without prior discussion, which the girlfriend found problematic. Public proposals can sometimes be seen as putting pressure on the other person, especially if there hasn't been a conversation about the future. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt unprepared for the commitment, which might be why she retracted her acceptance.\n\nThe author's hurt and decision to end the relationship stem from feeling led on and the emotional impact. However, the girlfriend's perspective is about the proposal being rushed. It's possible both parties have valid points. The author might have assumed mutual readiness, while the girlfriend didn't feel that readiness existed. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's a gray area. The author didn't explicitly discuss engagement plans before the proposal, which could have been a misstep. The girlfriend, on the other hand, didn't communicate her feelings about moving too quickly earlier. However, retracting a \"yes\" after a proposal is indeed hurtful and can be seen as insensitivity or dishonesty. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not discussing engagement first. While communication is key, the girlfriend's actions after the proposal (changing her mind) are also problematic. The author's decision to end the relationship due to the betrayal might be justified given the emotional toll, but the initial setup might have contributed to the situation. However, the main issue is the girlfriend's retraction after agreeing. \n\nConsidering all aspects, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions post-proposal are more damaging, and the author's decision to end things is reasonable. So, answer B.\n"
