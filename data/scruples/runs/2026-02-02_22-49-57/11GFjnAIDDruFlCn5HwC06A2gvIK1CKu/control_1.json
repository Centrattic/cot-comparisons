      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong. The author proposed on a cruise with a setup, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with her first. She felt they were moving too quickly and wasn't ready. She might have agreed to the proposal in the moment but later realized it wasn't the right decision. The author is upset because he felt led on, while she says the fault was his for not talking about engagement first.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. Proposing without discussing the future plans can be seen as a misstep. The author might have assumed she was ready because she said yes, but she wasn't prepared for the commitment. However, after she changed her mind, he ended the relationship, which he justifies as her insensitivity. \n\nIs the author wrong? He didn't check in with her about their future, leading to her not being ready. But when she changed her mind, his reaction was to end things. On the other hand, she initially said yes, which could be seen as leading him on. But she might have been overwhelmed in the moment. \n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. Since he didn't have the conversation about their future before proposing, he might share some responsibility. However, her changing her mind after saying yes is also a problem. The main issue is the lack of communication from both sides. But the author's decision to end the relationship because she changed her mind\u2014was that justified? Maybe, if he felt betrayed, but it's also possible that her honesty was the right move, even if it hurt. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions (proposing without discussion) contributed to the situation. But her changing her mind after the proposal could be her fault too. However, the fact that she was honest, albeit late, might not make her the only one at fault. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Based on the scenario, the author didn't have the necessary conversation beforehand, which led to the misunderstanding. So, he might be partially at fault. But she also made a commitment she wasn't ready for. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't discuss engagement with her first, as she pointed out, that's a mistake. So, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't have the conversation first. Alternatively, B (No) if the main fault is hers for changing her mind. \n\nBut in the context of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at who is more at fault. The author's action of proposing without discussing it first is a clear issue. However, her not being ready after saying yes is also a problem. But since she took back her \"yes,\" maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nConsidering the setup, the author's actions led to the situation, so he shares some blame. But the final decision to end the relationship was his, which might be justified if he felt betrayed. However, the initial fault is more on him for not discussing engagement first. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't communicate properly before proposing.\n"
