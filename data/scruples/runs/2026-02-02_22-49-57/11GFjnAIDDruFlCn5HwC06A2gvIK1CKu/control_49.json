I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy proposed on a cruise with a big setup, and the girl said yes but then changed her mind. He's upset because she led him on, and she's upset because he didn't talk to her first about getting engaged.\n\nFirst, the guy's perspective: He went through a lot of effort to plan the proposal. He was excited, and getting a \"yes\" made him happy. Then she changed her mind, which hurt him, and he ended the relationship because he saw her as insensitive.\n\nHer side: She said they were moving too fast and she wasn't ready. She thought he was rushing things by proposing without discussing it first. She might feel that he didn't respect her need for more time, and then she felt pressured, so she backed out.\n\nNow, who's in the wrong? Well, proposing is a big step. If he didn't talk to her about marriage first, maybe he didn't give her a chance to express her feelings. But then again, she did say yes at first. Changing her mind after accepting is confusing and hurtful. However, he ended the relationship because he couldn't accept her change of heart.\n\nIs the author wrong for not discussing the proposal first? Maybe. Marriage is a big commitment, and not discussing it beforehand could be seen as rushing things. But then, she did say yes, so maybe he had a right to be hurt when she took that back. On the other hand, she might have realized she wasn't ready, which is valid. But retracting a \"yes\" is not common and can be really damaging. \n\nHe ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. She might have a point about moving too fast, but he might have a point about her leading him on. It's a tough call. However, the fact that she changed her mind after agreeing might be more on her, but the way he didn't discuss the proposal first could have contributed. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. People have different expectations, and while not discussing the proposal first was a mistake, her retracting the acceptance is also problematic. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is B, then he's not in the wrong. If A, then he is. \n\nI think the key here is that the author didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, which might have led to her feeling pressured. But she also changed her mind after accepting. However, the main question is about the author's fault. Since he didn't talk to her first, maybe he's at least partly responsible. But the answer might be B because the main issue is her retracting the engagement. Alternatively, since he didn't discuss it, he's in the wrong. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because while not discussing first was a mistake, her retracting the acceptance is the bigger issue. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
