      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong. The person (author) proposed on a cruise, set up a big public proposal with a photographer, and the girlfriend said yes initially. But then later, she changed her mind and didn't want to marry him. He's upset, ended the relationship, and is asking if he's at fault. The options are A (he's wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing the idea of engagement with his partner first. The girlfriend said it was moving too quickly and felt pressured. She changed her mind after the initial \"yes,\" which might indicate she wasn't ready. But the author argues that she led him on by saying yes and then changing her mind.\n\nIs the author wrong for not discussing engagement first? Proposing is a big step, and doing it publicly without prior discussion could make the other person feel pressured. The girlfriend might have felt that the proposal was sudden, leading to her mixed reactions. On the other hand, the author was excited and followed through with the proposal, expecting a commitment once she said yes. However, her change of heart might mean she wasn't truly ready, but the author could be at fault for not checking in with her before the proposal.\n\nThe girlfriend's response about moving too quickly suggests that the author didn't give her enough time or consideration. Ending the relationship because of this might be his way of standing up for himself, but if the issue was miscommunication or lack of discussion, maybe he contributed to the situation. However, the key point is whether the author was wrong in the planning of the proposal. Since he didn't discuss the engagement idea with her beforehand, that's a mistake. But the girlfriend's insensitivity in changing her mind and being unresponsive to his feelings might balance the responsibility.\n\nIn terms of societal views, some might say the proposal was too sudden, leading to her not being ready. Others might think that if she said yes at first, she should have been committed. But given the details, the author not discussing the engagement plans beforehand is a significant factor. The girlfriend's reaction points to the proposal being a bit hasty. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility here. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions (changing her mind and being insensitive) are also problematic. But since the question is about the author's fault, maybe the answer is A (he's wrong) because he didn't communicate his intentions properly. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's insensitivity is more to blame, it would be B. The answer likely depends on the perspective. In many cases, not discussing such a big step as marriage beforehand is seen as a mistake, so the author might be at fault. Hence, A.\n"
