      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he proposed on a cruise, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He was really hurt and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with her first. She said yes but then didn't want to go through with the marriage. He ended it because he felt she led him on. \n\nThe key points here are: Did he make a mistake by proposing without talking about the engagement first? Proposing is a big step, and maybe he should have had that conversation before the proposal. However, people often propose without discussing it in detail, expecting a mutual understanding. \n\nOn her side, she said yes but then changed her mind. She claims it's because he was moving too quickly. But once someone says yes to a proposal, it's a commitment. If she wasn't ready, maybe she shouldn't have said yes. However, maybe she was under pressure or didn't realize the implications of saying \"yes\" in that moment. \n\nThe author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. But if she changed her mind after saying yes, maybe she's also at fault for not being honest. However, the way he ended it might have been abrupt. \n\nI think the author might have made a mistake by not discussing the engagement plans beforehand. Proposing publicly can be overwhelming, and maybe they didn't have that conversation. But her changing her mind after a \"yes\" is also a problem. However, in the context of relationships, if someone says yes and then backs out, that's hurtful. \n\nBut considering that the author ended it because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity, maybe he's justified. However, if she wasn't ready, maybe they both contributed to the situation. But the main issue is her retracting the \"yes,\" which is a significant betrayal. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she went back on her word. But maybe he did have a responsibility to talk about it first. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. I think both have some faults. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she retracted her acceptance, that's a major issue. But if he didn't discuss it first, maybe he's at fault. However, in many cultures, a proposal followed by a \"yes\" is a commitment. So if she retracted, maybe she's more at fault. The author ending the relationship because of that might be justified. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she changed her mind after accepting, which is a bigger issue than him proposing without a prior discussion. The author's reaction is understandable given her insensitivity.\n"
