      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author proposed during a cruise with a big setup, and the girlfriend said yes but then changed her mind later. The author then ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a public proposal, which can be a big deal. He was excited and probably put a lot of thought into it. When she initially said yes, he was happy, but then she didn't follow through. He felt hurt and ended the relationship because he thought she led him on without telling him she wasn't ready. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend said that the proposal was too sudden and they were moving too fast. She might not have felt ready to commit, and maybe the public proposal pressured her into saying yes when she wasn't actually ready. She might have felt that the author didn't discuss the engagement with her first, which could have been a factor in her decision.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to evaluate if either party is at fault. The author did set up a public proposal without discussing it with her. Maybe that was a mistake because it could have created pressure. However, the girlfriend then didn't communicate her feelings about not wanting to marry him. She led him on by saying yes and then changing her mind, which can be hurtful. \n\nIs the author at fault for proposing without discussing it? Maybe, since a major decision like marriage should be discussed beforehand. But proposing in a public way is common and not inherently wrong. The girlfriend's reaction might be her not being ready, which isn't entirely the author's fault. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author have a right to propose? Yes. Did he do it without discussing engagement? Maybe that's a point. But the girlfriend's change of heart after saying yes is also a significant issue. She might have not been honest with her feelings. \n\nThe user's answer is B (No), meaning the author isn't in the wrong. The reasoning could be that the author was justified in feeling hurt and ending the relationship because she didn't communicate her true feelings and led him on. The public proposal might have been a mistake, but the main issue was her not being honest. \n\nAlternatively, the author could be wrong for not discussing the engagement earlier, leading to the pressure. But since she didn't communicate her stance, maybe it's her fault. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because the main issue is the girlfriend not being ready and not communicating properly. The public proposal was a setup, but not the core problem. The author had the right to end the relationship after being lied to or misled.\n"
