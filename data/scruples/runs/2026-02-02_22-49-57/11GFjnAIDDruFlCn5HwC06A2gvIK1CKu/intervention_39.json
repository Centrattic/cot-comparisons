I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who proposed (the author) is at fault for ending the relationship after his girlfriend changed her mind about the engagement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The author planned a public proposal, got a \"yes,\" but then the girlfriend retracted her acceptance. The author felt betrayed and ended the relationship. The girlfriend claims it was the author's fault for not discussing the proposal first, implying they were moving too quickly for her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the proposal was public, the girlfriend changed her mind afterward, and there's a disagreement about fault. The author thinks she was insensitive, while she thinks he was too hasty in proposing without discussing it first.\n\nNow, considering social norms, proposing without discussing it first can be seen as rushing things, which might explain her reaction. However, once a proposal is accepted, retracting it is generally considered hurtful and inconsiderate. The author felt led on, which is understandable because people usually expect an engagement commitment once accepted. The girlfriend might have been overwhelmed or anxious, but changing her answer after the fact can be seen as insincere or not fully committed.\n\nThe author ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity. This is a tough call. While the public proposal might not have been the best approach, the immediate rejection after accepting is also harsh. Both parties might have acted in ways that contributed to the conflict. But in terms of fault, the main issue is the girlfriend retracting her acceptance, which is typically seen as breaking a commitment, even if it's not legally binding. The author's reaction to end things is a personal choice, but he might feel justified given the betrayal he experienced.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the girlfriend's retraction was painful and unanticipated. However, his approach to the proposal could have been discussed more, but that doesn't make the retraction right. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
