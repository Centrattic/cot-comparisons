I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong. The guy planned a big, public proposal on a cruise, got a yes, but then the girl changed her mind later. He ended the relationship because he felt she led him on and was insensitive. She said it was his fault for moving too fast and not discussing the engagement first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author set up a public proposal without talking about the engagement beforehand. The girl said she wasn't ready and felt they were moving too quickly. She might feel pressured if he didn't discuss it first. On the other hand, the author felt she led him on when she said yes and then changed her mind, which caused emotional pain.\n\nPublic proposals can be a big deal. If he didn't have that conversation about their future before planning the proposal, maybe he assumed too much. But her changing her mind after saying yes could be seen as inconsiderate. However, maybe she had mixed feelings and couldn't handle the pressure of a public commitment. \n\nThe key points are: Did he plan the proposal without discussing engagement, leading her to feel rushed. She might have given a yes in the moment but wasn't ready later. He reacted strongly by ending the relationship because of her insensitivity. \n\nI think the issue is about communication. If he didn't talk to her about wanting to get engaged before the proposal, he might have jumped the gun. But her changing her mind after the proposal could still be hurtful. However, in relationships, there's an expectation that both partners are on the same page. If he didn't discuss it, maybe he is partly at fault for not checking in with her first. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong). But some might argue that her reaction was also inconsiderate. It's a bit of a toss-up. I think the main point is the lack of prior discussion from his side, making him partly to blame.\n"
