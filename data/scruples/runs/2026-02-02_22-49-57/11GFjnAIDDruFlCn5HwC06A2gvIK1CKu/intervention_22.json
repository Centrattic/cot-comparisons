I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that turned into a breakup.\n\nFirst, the author planned a big, public proposal on a cruise. The girlfriend said yes but later changed her mind, saying they were moving too quickly. The author is upset because he feels she led him on, and he broke up with her over her insensitivity. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know if I agree.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The key points are: the proposal was public, she said yes but then changed her mind, and the author ended the relationship. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author planned the proposal, maybe assuming she would be ready. But the girl said they were moving too fast and didn't discuss engagement first. So maybe she felt pressured. The author is upset because she said yes, leading him to believe she was committed, but then she changed her mind. \n\nIs the author wrong for proposing without discussing it first? Maybe. Proposals can be a mutual decision, and planning a big event without her input could be seen as her not being ready. But he did propose, and she said yes initially. Then she changed her mind. So perhaps she's in the wrong for leading him on? Or maybe the author is wrong for not discussing the proposal first. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author proposed without talking to her about marriage first, that could be an issue. But she also changed her mind after he went through all the effort. It's a tough call. The author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, which might be justified if he felt betrayed. \n\nI think the girl's reaction is valid if they were moving too fast, but the author's response of ending the relationship might be an overreaction. However, the girl changing her mind after saying yes is problematic. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (author not in the wrong) because she changed her mind after he proposed. But some might say the author should have discussed the proposal first. However, the main issue is her retracting her acceptance. So probably B.\n"
