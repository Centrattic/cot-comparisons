      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author proposed during a cruise in a public setting with a photographer, and the girlfriend said yes but later changed her mind. The author then broke up with her, feeling hurt and betrayed, and is asking if they're the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author planned a surprise proposal, which is a big step. They set up a public proposal, which can be seen as a romantic gesture but might also put pressure on the other person. The girlfriend initially said yes but then changed her mind, leading to the breakup. The author feels the girlfriend was insincere and inconsiderate, while the girlfriend claims the proposal was too rushed and public without discussing the engagement first.\n\nThe main points here are communication and consent. The author didn't discuss the proposal with the girlfriend beforehand, which might have been a mistake. Proposing without prior discussion could lead to misunderstandings. The girlfriend feels the engagement was moving too fast, which is a valid concern. She might not have been ready for such a commitment, and the public proposal could have made her feel pressured to say yes on the spot without thinking it through. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction of changing her mind after saying yes is also problematic. Once someone says yes to a proposal, it's generally expected that they're committed. If she wasn't sure, she should have communicated that before accepting. The author's decision to end the relationship because of this might be seen as justified if they felt betrayed, but it's also a harsh response.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms and expectations, proposals are significant and usually require mutual readiness. The author's approach might have been too impulsive without checking in with the girlfriend's feelings. On the other hand, the girlfriend's change of heart after an acceptance could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIn terms of fault, both parties might share some responsibility. The author didn't discuss the proposal, leading to a lack of understanding about the girlfriend's readiness. The girlfriend didn't clarify her feelings before accepting, leading to a broken engagement. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the author's actions were insensitively rushed. If they didn't consider the girlfriend's perspective and forced a public proposal without prior discussion, they might share some blame. However, the girlfriend's decision to change her mind after accepting is a critical point. \n\nIn many cases, the person who changes their mind after a proposal is seen as the one in the wrong, as they led the other person to believe they were committed. So the author might not be entirely at fault here. However, the author's lack of communication before the proposal could also be a factor. \n\nBut the key here is that the girlfriend changed her mind after acceptance, which is a major issue. The author's breakup decision, while hurtful, is a response to being misled. So the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the girlfriend's actions were more problematic. However, there's a nuance where the author could have discussed the proposal first. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the main issue is the girlfriend changing her mind, the answer is likely B.\n"
