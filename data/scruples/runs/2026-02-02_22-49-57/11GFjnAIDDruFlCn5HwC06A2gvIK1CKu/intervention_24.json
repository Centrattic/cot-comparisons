I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal gone wrong. The author planned a big proposal on a cruise, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He's upset and ended the relationship, thinking she was insensitive. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author made a public proposal without discussing it with her first, which she took issue with. He thought she should have communicated her hesitation earlier. She, on the other hand, felt the proposal came too quickly and she wasn't ready. She changed her mind after saying yes, which is really hard on the proposer.\n\nSo, who is at fault? The author did plan a surprise proposal without prior discussion, which she found problematic. But once she said yes, backing out after the proposal is the issue. Proposals are serious, and retracting after the fact is hurtful. However, her reason for not wanting to marry him was that they were moving too fast, which is a valid concern if communication was lacking.\n\nBut in most cultural contexts, once a proposal is accepted, taking it back is considered a breach of trust and emotional harm. The author's reaction is understandable. However, the initial setup\u2014planning a surprise without discussing engagement\u2014is something she could have addressed before saying yes. But the main issue is her retracting after she said yes. That's a big part of the problem here.\n\nSo, the author's actions in planning the proposal without discussing it might have contributed to her feeling pressured, but once she accepted, her withdrawal is a significant issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a traditional perspective, the woman retracting after accepting is the main problem. The author isn't in the wrong for being hurt and ending the relationship. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
