      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a proposal that was accepted but then retracted. The writer proposed on a cruise with a public setup, and the girlfriend said yes but later changed her mind. The writer ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the writer did something wrong. Proposing is a big step, but doing it publicly without discussing it first might be seen as moving too quickly. The girlfriend mentioned they were moving too fast, so maybe the writer didn't consider her readiness. However, the key point here is that she agreed to the proposal publicly but then changed her mind. That could be seen as leading him on, which is where the writer's frustration comes from.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer ended the relationship because of this. Is that fair? If she genuinely wasn't ready and communicated that, maybe the writer's reaction is harsh. But if she said yes and then took it back, it's understandable he felt hurt and betrayed. The question is whether the writer is at fault for not discussing the proposal first. Public proposals can be a tradition, but they might not be the best approach if the couple hasn't discussed the future. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she wasn't on board with the engagement, so the writer might have a valid point in ending things due to her insensitivity.\n\nBut is the writer in the wrong? If he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, that's a problem. However, the act of proposing itself isn't inherently wrong. The conflict arises from her changing her mind after agreeing. The answer hinges on whether he should have discussed the proposal more, which he didn't, but her retracting the \"yes\" is also an issue. The user is asking if the writer is in the wrong. Considering both sides, it's a mix, but the main fault might lie with the girlfriend for her change of heart after agreeing. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
