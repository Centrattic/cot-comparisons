      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author proposed to his girlfriend during a cruise with a photographer, and she initially said yes. They celebrated with champagne and photos, but later she changed her mind and didn't want to actually marry him. The author was really upset, cried, and confronted her, leading to her getting angry and saying the problem was that he planned a public proposal without discussing the engagement first. She claimed they were moving too quickly, and he ended the relationship because of her insensitivity.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the proposal process and the communication between the two people. Proposing is a big step, and the author did it without discussing the engagement first. That's a red flag. Unexpected public proposals can be stressful for some people. The girlfriend might have felt pressured because it was a surprise, leading her to say yes impulsively but then realize she wasn't ready. The author's reaction is understandable\u2014being heartbroken is a natural response when someone accepts a proposal but later retracts it. However, the girlfriend's main issue was that he didn't talk to her about wanting to get engaged before doing it publicly. That's a significant oversight because marriage is a major life decision, and both people should be in agreement and have discussed it thoroughly before such a commitment. The author might have assumed she was ready, but without prior discussion, it's his responsibility to have checked in with her first. His accusation that she was insensitive might be misplaced because the root issue was perhaps a lack of communication from both sides, but the author definitely made a mistake by not discussing the engagement beforehand. So, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
