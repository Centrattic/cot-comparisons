I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that he proposed on a cruise, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He feels betrayed and ended the relationship. She says it's his fault for not discussing the proposal first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Proposing is a big step, and he did it without prior discussion. Even though it's a romantic gesture, maybe he should have talked to her first about marriage. She said they were moving too quickly, so maybe she wasn't ready. But she did say yes, which is confusing. \n\nNow, the question is who is in the wrong. From the man's perspective, he was hurt and felt led on. From her perspective, the proposal came out of the blue, and she didn't want to commit. The user is asking if he's at fault. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the proposal was a surprise without discussing the future, that's a problem. But she also changed her mind after saying yes, which is also confusing. However, the main issue here might be the lack of communication before the proposal. He expected her to be ready, but she wasn't. So he might be partly at fault. \n\nBut the answer options are A (he's wrong) or B (he's not). The community might see that while the proposal was sudden, after she said yes, changing her mind is also problematic. However, since she had the chance to say no at the time and then later changed her mind, that's her issue. But he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, which is a mistake. \n\nI think the answer would lean towards B (he's not in the wrong) because the main issue was her changing her mind after the proposal. However, it's a bit of a gray area. But the user ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. So maybe the author isn't wrong because she was inconsistent, and he had the right to end things. So answer B."
