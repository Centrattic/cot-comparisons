I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who proposed is in the wrong after their girlfriend took back her \"yes\" during a proposal on a cruise. The person feels betrayed and ended the relationship because they think she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The proposer set up a public proposal, which can be a big moment. The girlfriend said yes initially but then changed her mind. The proposer is hurt and feels she led him on. She, on the other hand, says the proposal was too rushed and they weren't discussing marriage yet. She didn't want to get married, so she backed out.\n\nSo, who is at fault here? The proposer could be seen as making a big decision without discussing it first, which might have been a mistake. Proposals are significant, and communication is key. On the other hand, the girlfriend didn't clarify her feelings and went along with the proposal, then changed her mind. That could be seen as not honest communication.\n\nBut the proposer is upset because she didn't tell him she wasn't ready. She might argue that the proposal was unexpected and she wasn't prepared for that commitment. The proposer ended the relationship, which seems harsh, but maybe he felt justified given the emotional impact. \n\nI think the key points are communication and mutual understanding. The proposer didn't talk about the proposal beforehand, which could have led to confusion. The girlfriend didn't express her concerns about moving too fast. Both might share some responsibility. However, the proposer acted on his feelings and ended the relationship. The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to decide if the answer is A or B.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, sometimes the person who ends the relationship is seen as the one in the right if they were hurt. But if the proposer didn't communicate his intentions, that's a point against him. The girlfriend changing her mind after saying yes is also problematic. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend didn't communicate her feelings properly and then led him on. The proposer had a right to be hurt and end things. However, the proposer could have discussed the proposal first. But in this context, the main issue is the girlfriend's insensitivity. So B makes sense here.\n"
