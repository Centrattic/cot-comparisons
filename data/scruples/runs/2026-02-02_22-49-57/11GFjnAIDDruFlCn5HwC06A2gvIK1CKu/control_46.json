      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person asked if they're in the wrong after their girlfriend (now ex) took back her \"yes\" to his proposal. He set up a big public proposal, she said yes, but then changed her mind later. He felt hurt and ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, the proposal was public and planned without prior discussion, which she pointed out. She might have felt pressured if he didn't talk about marriage plans first. Engagements are big steps, and maybe they didn't have that conversation yet. Her changing her mind could be because she wasn't ready, which is a common issue. But then he ended the relationship because he felt she led him on. \n\nOn the other hand, she did say yes, so he had every right to feel betrayed when she retracted. The key points here are communication and consent. If he didn't discuss his intentions beforehand, maybe he should have considered her readiness. However, once she agreed, retracting her consent after committing could be hurtful. \n\nBut relationships require mutual agreement and understanding. If she wasn't ready, she should have communicated that before saying yes. His reaction of ending the relationship might be justified if he felt she was insincere. However, maybe he could have given her a chance to explain before breaking up. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a shared responsibility. He didn't talk about the proposal, she didn't check her feelings before saying yes. But since she changed her mind after agreeing, that might be where her fault lies. However, the way he ended it without understanding her perspective could be his fault too. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is that she took back her yes, which is a commitment. The author felt led on, which is valid. But if she was honest after the fact, perhaps his reaction was too harsh. However, given the situation, he has a right to be upset. The answer might be B (No), but I'm a bit conflicted because both sides have valid points. However, since the user is the one asking if they're in the wrong, and based on the scenario, the main fault could be on her for retracting the commitment, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
