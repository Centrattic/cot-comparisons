I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is at fault. The scenario involves a proposal during a cruise that was initially accepted but then retracted by the girlfriend, leading to a breakup. \n\nFirst, the author set up a public proposal, which is a big step. The girlfriend initially said yes but later changed her mind. The author feels hurt and betrayed, leading to him ending the relationship. The girlfriend's side is that the proposal was planned without discussion and that they were moving too fast.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, proposing is a significant commitment. Even though it's a public setting, perhaps the way it was handled without prior discussion might be an issue. The girlfriend might have felt pressured, but she did accept at first. However, retracting the acceptance after the fact could be seen as insensitivity as well. The author felt led on, which is understandable, but he did plan the proposal without checking in with her about readiness. Both parties have some responsibility here. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer seems to depend on whether the lack of prior discussion made the proposal inappropriate. Since relationships typically require communication about such major steps, not discussing the proposal beforehand could be a misstep. However, the girlfriend's retraction after accepting might also be a problem. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So, considering that the proposal was a surprise without discussing it first, maybe the author is partially at fault. However, the main issue is the girlfriend changing her mind. The answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, because the girlfriend retracted after accepting, which is hurtful. But some might argue the author should have discussed it first. Hmm, tricky. I think the key is that the author isn't entirely at fault. The answer is B.\n"
