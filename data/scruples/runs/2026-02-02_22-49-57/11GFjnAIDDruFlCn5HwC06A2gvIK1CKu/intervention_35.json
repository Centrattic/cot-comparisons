We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author proposed during a cruise with a setup, got a yes, but then the girlfriend changed her mind. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it first. The girlfriend said yes, then changed her mind. The author feels she led him on, while she argues he moved too fast without discussing it.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? Let's consider both sides. The author wanted to do a big public proposal, which might be his way of showing commitment, but maybe he didn't check in with her first. Engagement is a big step, and having a public proposal could pressure her. But she did say yes, then changed her mind, which is confusing. She might have felt pressured or unsure in the moment.\n\nThe author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive, but maybe he should have taken her feelings into account. Planning a proposal is a big decision, and not discussing it with her first might have been a mistake. On the other hand, she didn't stick with her answer, which is also a problem. She might not have been ready, but she didn't clarify before the big event.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he didn't consult her first about the proposal, that's a valid point. Proposals are significant, and both partners should be on the same page. Planning a public one without discussing it could lead to pressure. However, she did accept the proposal, then changed her mind. That's a flip-flop, which isn't great either.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. If he didn't talk to her about getting engaged before the proposal, that's a misstep. But she also didn't communicate her readiness. However, the user's question is specifically about the author's fault. Since he didn't check in with her first, maybe he shares some blame. But she did say yes and then retracted. It's a tough call.\n\nIn the end, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but he does share some responsibility for not discussing the timing of the proposal. However, the main issue might be hers for changing her mind. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might be B (No) because the main fault is hers for not being consistent and not being honest, but the author's approach could have been better. So, the answer is B.\n"
