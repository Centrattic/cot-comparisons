I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he proposed on a cruise, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He's asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy planned a big proposal, which was public with a photographer. She initially said yes but then didn't want to go through with the marriage. She blamed him for moving too fast and not discussing the engagement first. He thinks she should have been honest earlier instead of leading him on.\n\nFrom his perspective, he was excited and set up a proposal, expecting a positive answer. When she changed her mind, he felt betrayed and ended the relationship. He might feel she was insensitive by not being upfront.\n\nFrom her side, she might have been pressured by the public proposal. Maybe she felt she couldn't say no in that moment and then realized she wasn't ready. She could have felt that he didn't take the time to talk about the future of their relationship before popping the question. Proposals can be stressful, and a public one might add pressure.\n\nIs he at fault for not discussing engagement first? Maybe. Proposing is a big step, and ideally, both partners should be on the same page. If he didn't talk about it with her beforehand, he might have assumed she was ready, which could be his mistake. But she also could have communicated her feelings more clearly instead of leading him on after saying yes.\n\nEnding the relationship because of this might be his way of protecting himself from further pain. However, breaking up immediately after such a shock could be impulsive. But given the emotional hurt, it's understandable.\n\nIs he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He might have made a mistake by not discussing the engagement seriously before proposing, leading to her feeling unprepared. However, her changing her mind after saying yes is also hurtful. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not discussing first or for ending the relationship.\n\nIn many cases, proposals are supposed to be a surprise, but ideally, there's some prior conversation. If there wasn't, that's a point of contention. However, her reaction after saying yes is also a significant issue. So, maybe he's partially at fault for not ensuring she was ready, but she's also at fault for not being honest.\n\nThe answer depends on whether the main fault lies in not discussing before the proposal or in her retracting her acceptance. If the question is whether the author is in the wrong, it's possible he shares some responsibility, but maybe not entirely. The answer might lean towards B (No), meaning he's not in the wrong, but it's a close call. Alternatively, maybe A if the community thinks he should have talked about it first. But given the way he's framing it, he might be seen as not entirely wrong because she changed her mind after the proposal. But the fact that he didn't discuss it first is a problem.\n"
