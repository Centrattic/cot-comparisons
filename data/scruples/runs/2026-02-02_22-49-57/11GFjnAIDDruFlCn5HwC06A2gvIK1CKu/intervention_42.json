I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is a proposal that went wrong. The author planned a public proposal on a cruise, the girlfriend said yes, but then changed her mind later. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: he went to a lot of effort to propose, was excited, and felt betrayed when she changed her mind. He ended the relationship because he couldn't forgive her for leading him on. The girlfriend's perspective: she wasn't ready for marriage, thought the public proposal was too fast, and maybe she felt pressured.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the author is at fault. The key points here are about communication and expectations. The girlfriend claims the proposal was too rushed and public. The author didn't discuss the engagement plans with her first. That's a valid point\u2014maybe he should have talked about marriage before making a public commitment. But she changed her mind after saying yes, which could be seen as breaking a promise. However, when someone says \"yes\" to a proposal, it's a big commitment, and backing out can be devastating. \n\nBut the root cause might be a lack of communication. If they hadn't had those deeper conversations about marriage and moving in together, then maybe both are at fault. The author might have assumed she was ready, while she wasn't. The girlfriend's response about the public proposal being a problem could indicate that she felt pressured, which is a common issue in relationships. \n\nThe author ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity. Is that justified? He was hurt and felt betrayed, which is understandable. But was the girlfriend's reaction justifiable? She might have felt overwhelmed by the public proposal and wasn't ready for marriage. However, after saying yes, going back on it is a significant betrayal. \n\nIn terms of fault, both sides might have contributed. The author didn't check in with her about marriage plans before proposing, and she changed her mind after accepting. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the public proposal was a mistake. If the author didn't discuss it first, that's his fault. If the girlfriend changed her mind without a valid reason after agreeing, that's her fault. However, the story is from the author's perspective, and he ends the relationship because he can't overlook her insensitivity. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the girlfriend changed her mind after a commitment, which is hard to forgive. However, the initial proposal without discussing it might have contributed. But the main issue is the girlfriend retracting her acceptance. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
