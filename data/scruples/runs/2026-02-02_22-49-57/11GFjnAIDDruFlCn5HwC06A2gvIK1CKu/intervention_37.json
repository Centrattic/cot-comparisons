      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who proposed) is in the wrong after their now-ex girlfriend took back her \"yes\" to the proposal.\n\nFirst, the setup: the author planned a public proposal with a photographer during a cruise. The girlfriend said \"yes\" but later changed her mind, leading to a breakup. The author feels betrayed, thinking she led him on, while she claims he moved too fast without discussing marriage first.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's argument is that she shouldn't have said yes if she wasn't serious, and he ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. Her argument is that the public proposal was pressuring her and that they weren't ready.\n\nFrom a traditional perspective, proposing without discussing marriage is a big step. The author might have assumed she was ready, but she claims they were moving too fast. Public proposals can be overwhelming, and maybe she felt pressured in the moment. However, once she said \"yes,\" it's a commitment, so retracting it could be seen as inconsiderate. But if they hadn't discussed the future, maybe the author did rush things.\n\nThe key points are: Did the author plan a proposal without discussing engagement? Yes. Did she change her mind after accepting? Yes. The author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. She blamed him for moving too fast.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some. The author could have checked if she was ready, and she could have communicated her hesitation before accepting. However, once she said \"yes,\" retracting it would hurt him, so maybe she should have been honest earlier. The author's reaction of ending the relationship because of her change of heart is understandable if he felt betrayed.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? He planned a proposal without discussing it, which could be a misstep. However, the immediate rejection after a \"yes\" is more problematic. So, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong, but both parties have some responsibility. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer is more likely B (No).\n"
