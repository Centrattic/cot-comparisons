      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong after their girlfriend said \"yes\" to a proposal but then changed her mind.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The man planned a public proposal during a cruise, set up with a photographer, and she said yes. But later, she changed her mind, leading to a breakup. The key points here are the public nature of the proposal and the subsequent withdrawal of her acceptance.\n\nThe man feels betrayed and can't overlook her insensitivity. He ended the relationship. The woman's reasoning is that he moved too fast and didn't discuss engagement with her first. She also didn't want to marry him, even after saying yes. \n\nFrom the man's perspective, he did everything romantic and thoughtful, but she didn't communicate her true feelings. He was hurt and ended the relationship because he couldn't get over the betrayal. \n\nThe woman's side is that the proposal was too public and they were moving too fast. She didn't communicate her hesitation before the proposal. Now, after accepting, she's realizing she's not ready, which is after the fact.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The man might have assumed she was ready because she said yes, but maybe she didn't fully consider her feelings until after. However, the woman should have been honest about her readiness before accepting. If she wasn't ready, she should have said so then, not after. \n\nOn the other hand, the public proposal without discussing the engagement might have been too abrupt for her. Maybe he didn't give her a chance to discuss it privately first. But once she accepted, retracting it later without clear communication is problematic. \n\nSo, is the man in the wrong? If the woman changed her mind after accepting, that's her responsibility. But if the proposal was too public and he didn't check in with her about her feelings beforehand, that could be his fault. \n\nThe man's reaction to end the relationship due to her insensitivity is his choice. If she was insensitive by changing her mind, he has the right to end it. However, if he didn't consider her feelings and readiness before proposing, that's on him. \n\nIn conclusion, both parties have some responsibility. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer depends on whose actions were more at fault. The woman's retraction after accepting might be more unforgivable, but the man's approach could have been more considerate. However, the user's original thought is that the author isn't wrong. So, based on that, the answer would be B for No.\n"
