      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after their girlfriend took back her \"yes\" to a proposal.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The man planned a public proposal on a cruise with a photographer. She said yes, they celebrated, but then later that night she changed her mind. He felt broken, cried, and ended the relationship. She blamed him for moving too fast and not discussing the engagement first. He thinks she was insensitive.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. \n\nFrom his perspective, he made a big gesture, got a yes, and then she retracted it. That's incredibly hurtful. He might feel betrayed because she didn't clarify her feelings beforehand. He ended the relationship because he couldn't forgive her for what he saw as insensitivity. \n\nFrom her side, she might have felt pressured by the public proposal. Maybe she wasn't ready for marriage and the sudden setup made her realize she wasn't committed. She could argue that he didn't talk to her about the engagement first, leading to her confusion or pressure. \n\nNow, societal norms about proposals: Traditionally, the proposal is a significant step, and the accepter is expected to be committed. However, if she felt overwhelmed by the public nature, maybe the pressure was too much, leading her to have second thoughts. \n\nBut he didn't discuss the proposal with her first. While it's a surprise, he should have checked in if she was ready for marriage. Not discussing could lead to her feeling blindsided. However, his intention was to propose, and she gave a yes in the moment. \n\nHe ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. Her retraction caused him a lot of pain. But he might also have contributed by not having the conversation. However, her taking back her acceptance after the fact is a major issue. \n\nI think both have some responsibility. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. He proposed without prior discussion, which could be a mistake. However, she changed her mind after accepting. The main wrong here is hers for retracting her consent. But he ending the relationship because of her actions isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The woman's actions were more in the wrong for taking back her acceptance, but the man's approach could be seen as hasty. However, given the context, he's justified in ending the relationship due to her insensitivity. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
