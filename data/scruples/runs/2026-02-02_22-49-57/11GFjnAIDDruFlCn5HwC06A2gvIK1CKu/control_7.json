      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The person proposed to their girlfriend on a cruise, set up a public proposal with a photographer, and she said yes. Then later, she changed her mind and didn't want to get married. He was upset and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitve. She blamed him for moving too fast and not discussing the proposal with her first. \n\nSo, the key points here are about communication and expectations. The proposer did a big, public proposal without prior discussion. The girlfriend felt that they were moving too quickly and wasn't ready for marriage, which led her to take back her \"yes.\" \n\nI need to consider both sides. From the proposer's perspective, he wanted to get married and went through the effort of planning a proposal, which she initially accepted. Then she changed her mind, which caused emotional pain. He ended the relationship because he couldn't accept her insensitivity. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's side, she might feel that the proposal was rushed. Marriage is a big commitment, and maybe she didn't feel ready. She might have felt pressured by the public proposal and didn't want to say no in front of others, so she said yes but later reconsidered. She could be arguing that the proposer didn't take the time to have a private conversation about their future before springing the proposal on her. \n\nThe question is whether the proposer is in the wrong. Did he make a mistake by not discussing the engagement before proposing publicly? Proposals typically involve some level of discussion beforehand, even if it's not formal. If they hadn't had that conversation, maybe he did move too fast. On the other hand, she could have been honest during the proposal if she wasn't ready. But she might have felt pressured into saying yes at that moment. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some. However, the question is whether the author (the proposer) is in the wrong. If he didn't communicate his intentions properly and she didn't express her readiness, it's a two-way issue. But in many relationships, it's expected that both partners are on the same page about major commitments like marriage. If he proposed without knowing her stance, maybe he did act impulsively. However, the girlfriend then went back on her word after saying yes, which complicates things. \n\nI think the main issue here is the lack of prior communication. Proposing in a public, emotional setting without discussing the commitment beforehand could be seen as a mistake. The girlfriend might have been caught off guard, leading her to say yes and then reconsider. So, while both might have contributed, the proposer's approach could be at fault for not ensuring they were both ready before proposing. Therefore, the author might be at least partially in the wrong.\n"
