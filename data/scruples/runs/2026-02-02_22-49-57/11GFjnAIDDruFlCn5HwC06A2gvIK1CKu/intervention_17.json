She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a proposal gone wrong. The author planned a public proposal on a cruise, got a \"yes,\" but then the girlfriend changed her mind later. The author ended the relationship because he felt hurt and she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author set up a big, public proposal without discussing it with his partner first. He might have thought she was ready, but she felt they were moving too fast. She said yes in the moment but changed her mind afterward. The author accuses her of leading him on, but she claims the issue was his rushing and not discussing the engagement.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. Proposing in a public setting can be a big surprise, which might not be ideal if the couple hasn't discussed the future together. The woman might have said yes on impulse because of the moment, but later realized she wasn't ready. The author then ended the relationship because he felt hurt by her insensitivity.\n\nNow, was the author in the wrong? If he didn't discuss his intentions with her beforehand, maybe he assumed she wanted to get married, which could be his fault for not having that conversation. However, she also said yes and then changed her mind. That's a big flip-flop, which could be seen as inconsiderate, especially after the emotional investment he made in the proposal.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he didn't communicate his plans, maybe he shares some responsibility. However, her changing her mind after saying yes is also problematic. The user thinks he's not wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation.\n\nThe answer could hinge on the lack of prior discussion. If he had talked to her about marriage before the proposal, maybe this wouldn't have happened. But the woman's reaction afterward might be just as much to blame. However, the question is about the author being in the wrong. Since he didn't discuss it, perhaps he's at fault for not checking in with her. Alternatively, her changing her mind is the main issue.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the woman changed her mind after accepting, which is the main issue here. The author's actions led to a proposal she wasn't ready for, but her inconsistency is the bigger problem. However, there's an argument that he should have discussed it first. But given the way the question is framed, the focus is on her taking back the \"yes,\" so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
