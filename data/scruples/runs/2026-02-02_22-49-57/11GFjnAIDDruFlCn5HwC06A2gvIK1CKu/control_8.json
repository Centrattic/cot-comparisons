She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person proposed during a cruise, set it up with a photographer and all that, and the girlfriend said yes. Then later, she changed her mind. The author felt really hurt, cried, and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a big, public proposal without discussing the engagement first. The girlfriend later said they were moving too quickly and that the proposal wasn't discussed. So, maybe the author did rush things. Proposing is a huge step, and not talking about it beforehand might have been a mistake. The girlfriend might have felt pressured or unprepared because it was a surprise. \n\nBut then, when she said yes, she later changed her mind. That's really tough. Even if the proposal was a surprise, once she said yes, the author was probably expecting her to follow through. She might have realized she wasn't ready, but retracting her acceptance could be seen as not being honest. However, maybe she was honest in saying she wasn't ready after the proposal, and the author didn't want to hear that, leading to the breakup.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did plan a surprise proposal without discussing it, which might have contributed to her feeling unprepared. But once she said yes, changing her mind is hurtful. However, the girlfriend also didn't communicate her feelings clearly before accepting. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. But maybe the real issue is communication. The author didn't talk about the proposal first, and the girlfriend didn't clarify her readiness. So both sides might have made mistakes. But the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. Since he didn't discuss the proposal and then got upset when she changed her mind, maybe he is partially at fault. However, the girlfriend's actions after saying yes are also problematic. It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the author's decision to not discuss the engagement before proposing is a key point. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't talk it over first. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the girlfriend's change of heart is also a problem, but the initial proposal setup could be his fault. Hmm.\n"
