      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he proposed to his girlfriend on a cruise, she said yes, but then later changed her mind. He was really hurt and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. She said the problem was that he planned a public proposal without discussing it with her first, and that they were moving too quickly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was excited and wanted to propose, so he set up a public proposal. She initially said yes but then didn't want to go through with the marriage. From his perspective, she led him on, which hurt him a lot. He ended the relationship because he felt she wasn't honest or considerate.\n\nOn her side, she might feel that the proposal was too sudden and public, which could have made her uncomfortable. She might not have been ready for marriage yet, so when she said yes, maybe she was reacting to the moment but realized later. She argues that the problem was the author moving too quickly without discussing it with her first.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Did the author do something wrong by proposing without discussing it with her first? Traditionally, proposals can be surprise events, but maybe in their relationship, communication was important. The fact that she said yes but then changed her mind might suggest that she wasn't fully committed at the time. However, a proposal is a big step, and if she wasn't ready, she should have been honest earlier.\n\nThe author's reaction: He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. But maybe he could have given her a chance to explain instead of immediately breaking up. However, he was hurt and felt betrayed, which is understandable.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he planned the proposal without discussing it, maybe he didn't consider her feelings. But she also had the opportunity to express her readiness for marriage before the proposal. The public aspect might be a factor, but not necessarily a fault on his part if that's what he wanted. However, not discussing it first could be seen as moving too quickly. But she also accepted the proposal initially. So maybe she is in the wrong for changing her mind after saying yes. But the question is about the author's actions. If he didn't force her to say yes in public, but she changed her mind later, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the fact that he ended the relationship because of her change of heart could be seen as his fault if he didn't give her a chance to explain. But given the emotional context, it's hard to say.\n\nIn some cases, people might think that the proposal should be discussed first. But if she said yes and then changed her mind, maybe she's the one in the wrong. However, the author's main issue was that she didn't want to marry him after saying yes, which is a big deal. So the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he was hurt and ended the relationship due to her insensitivity, which is understandable. Alternatively, if he didn't plan the proposal with her input, maybe he's partially at fault, but the main issue was her changing her mind. So the answer is B.\n"
