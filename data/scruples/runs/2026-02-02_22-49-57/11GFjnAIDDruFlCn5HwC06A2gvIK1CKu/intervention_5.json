We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal gone wrong. The author set up a public proposal on a cruise, and the girlfriend said yes but then changed her mind later. The author feels hurt and ended the relationship because they think the girlfriend was insensitve.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a big proposal without discussing it with his girlfriend first. Maybe he assumed she was ready, but she wasn't. She might have felt pressured or that things were moving too fast. On the other hand, the author was genuinely excited and had planned all this, only to be rejected after saying yes publicly. That's a huge emotional letdown, and he's justified in feeling hurt. \n\nBut was he wrong to propose without talking about engagement? Proposals can be a big deal, and maybe they didn't have that conversation. However, it's also common for people to propose without prior discussion, depending on the relationship. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she wasn't ready, which is her issue. The author might have misread the signals, but that doesn't necessarily make him wrong. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author didn't discuss the engagement plans, which could be a misstep. But the girlfriend didn't communicate her feelings either, even after agreeing to marry him. The author ended the relationship because of the insensitivity, which is a common reaction to betrayal. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he didn't discuss the proposal first, maybe he's partially at fault. But the girlfriend's change of heart after saying yes is also problematic. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the author's actions of ending the relationship because of the betrayal might be justified. The main question is whether the author's proposal was the root issue. If the girlfriend wasn't ready, but the author didn't discuss it, then maybe both sides have some responsibility. But the user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, and I might agree because the girlfriend's actions after saying yes are more damaging. So the answer might be B.\n"
