      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong. The guy planned a public proposal on a cruise, set up a photographer, and when she said yes, he was over the moon. But then later, she changed her mind and didn't want to marry him. He feels broken and ended the relationship because he thinks she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy put a lot of effort into planning the proposal, which was a big commitment. Public proposals can be a bit dramatic, and maybe he was excited and wanted to share the moment with others. However, he didn't discuss the idea of engagement with her beforehand. That's probably a key point here. The girl said it was his fault for moving too quickly without talking about it. She might have felt pressured or caught off guard, even if she initially said yes. \n\nWhen he asked her why she changed her mind, she got upset and said the problem was his approach. He responded by ending the relationship because he felt she was insensitive for leading him on. But maybe he should have considered her perspective. If she didn't want to get married yet, maybe a public proposal wasn't the way to go. He didn't give her space to process the proposal privately, which could have led to her feeling overwhelmed. \n\nOn the other hand, once she said \"yes,\" even if she wasn't ready, he trusted her answer and celebrated. She later changed her mind, which can be hurtful. But he did end the relationship because of her insensitivity, not because she changed her mind. The question is whether he's in the wrong for ending the relationship or if she is in the wrong for changing her answer.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. He didn't discuss his plans with her, which is a big step. Proposing without prior discussion might have been a mistake. She might have been trying to avoid the situation by saying yes publicly but then backing out later. However, once she said yes, he had a right to feel hurt. But ending the relationship immediately might have been a reaction driven by his hurt feelings rather than giving her a chance to explain or work through it. \n\nIt's possible that both have some responsibility here. The guy didn't check in with her before proposing, and she didn't communicate her true feelings until after the proposal. However, the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. If he didn't discuss the proposal with her, that's a misstep. But was ending the relationship the wrong move? Maybe not entirely, if he felt that her insensitivity was something he couldn't overcome. \n\nBut the key point is whether he's in the wrong. The girl changed her mind after agreeing, which is hurtful. However, the fact that he didn't talk to her about the proposal beforehand is also a problem. So maybe he shares some responsibility here. But if the question is whether he is in the wrong, the answer might be A (Yes) because he didn't communicate his intentions properly, leading to her confusion. However, if the focus is on her changing her mind and his reaction, maybe B (No). It's a bit tricky. \n\nIn many similar situations, the person who proposes without prior discussion is often seen as having a fault because they didn't consider the partner's feelings. So the author might be at fault for not discussing the proposal. The girl then changed her mind, which is also a problem, but the trigger for the conflict was his approach. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes), the author is in the wrong for not discussing the proposal first. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe both are at fault. The question is about the author specifically. Since the user asks if he's in the wrong, and the setup was his fault, maybe A is the answer. But I need to check if the main issue is his reaction to her changing her mind. If he ended the relationship because she was insensitive, but she had her own reasons, maybe the answer is B. Hmm.\n"
