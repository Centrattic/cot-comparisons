I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA, or \"Am I the Asshole\") is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong. The man proposed publicly on a cruise with a setup, and the woman said yes, but later changed her mind. He was heartbroken, and she blamed him for rushing things. He ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her \"insensitivity.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The man put a lot of effort into planning a public proposal without discussing it with her first. He might have assumed she was ready for marriage, but she wasn't. The woman said yes in the moment but realized she wasn't ready. She thinks he moved too quickly and didn't involve her in the decision-making process. The man feels betrayed because she led him on and then didn't follow through.\n\nIs the man in the wrong? Well, proposing without talking about marriage first could be seen as a lack of communication. Marriage is a big step, and both partners should be on the same page. By not discussing their readiness for marriage beforehand, he might have made an assumption that wasn't shared. Public proposals can also add pressure, and maybe she felt pressured to say yes in the moment but wasn't truly ready.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman changed her mind after saying yes. That's hurtful, and it's understandable why he felt shattered. But her reasoning is that they were moving too fast. The man ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive, but her actions (changing her mind) were also hurtful.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The man didn't check in with her about their future before proposing. The woman didn't clarify her feelings before agreeing and then changing her mind. Both might have missteps. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is the one who proposed without discussing it, leading to the misunderstanding. So maybe he shares some responsibility. But the woman's reaction to reject after saying yes is also problematic. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the person who causes emotional harm by not being honest or changing their mind after commitment is often seen as the asshole. But here, the woman changed her mind, but the man didn't discuss the proposal with her first. It's a bit of a mutual issue. However, since the woman said yes and then changed her mind, that's a significant betrayal. The man might feel wronged, but he also didn't communicate his intentions properly. So the answer might lean towards the man not being entirely at fault, but there's some nuance. However, the user's options are only A or B. Given that, the man's actions (proposing without discussion) are a mistake, but the woman's actions (changing her mind) are worse. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but maybe he shares part of it. However, many people might argue that the woman is the one in the wrong here, so the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But the user's options are A or B. So considering that, the man's failure to communicate could make him partially at fault, but the woman's actions are more severe. Hmm. It's a tough call. But in the context of AITA, if the person who changed their mind after saying yes is the main issue, then the author isn't in the wrong. But the author's mistake was not discussing the proposal first. So maybe the answer is B (No), because the woman is the one who changed her mind, even though the author made a mistake. So the answer would be B.\n"
