I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault in the scenario where his girlfriend said yes to the proposal but then changed her mind. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with her first. That could be seen as a misstep because he didn't check if she was ready for that step. Public proposals can be a big deal, and maybe he assumed she was ready without confirming. \n\nThen, when she changed her mind, he felt hurt and ended the relationship. But her reason was that they were moving too fast and she wasn't ready. She might feel pressured if he sprung the proposal on her without prior talks about marriage. \n\nIs the author wrong for proposing without discussing it first? Possibly. Engagements are a significant commitment, and communication is key. If he didn't talk about marriage beforehand, he might have misread the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, she did say yes and then backed out, which is hurtful. But he ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. Maybe both have some responsibility here. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't communicate his intentions first, he might share some blame. However, her retracting her consent after the proposal is also problematic. \n\nThe key points are lack of communication from his side and her not following through. The answer might depend on cultural norms and relationship dynamics, but generally, not discussing such a big step beforehand can be a mistake. So, the author might be in the wrong (A), but it's a bit of a grey area. Alternatively, if the focus is on her retracting the yes, maybe not (B). \n\nHmm, the community often looks at these situations as shared responsibility, but the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't talk to her first, he's at least partially responsible. So answer A.\n"
