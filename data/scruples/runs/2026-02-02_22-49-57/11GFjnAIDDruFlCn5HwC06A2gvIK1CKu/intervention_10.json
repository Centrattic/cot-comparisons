      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their ex-girlfriend took back her \"yes\" during a proposal. The situation is a little complex because the woman said yes to the proposal, but then changed her mind later that night.\n\nFirst, the author set up a public proposal with a photographer and everything. He was excited and thought she was committed. The woman then \"dropped the ball\" by not wanting to marry him. The author is upset because she led him on, while she claims it was his fault for not discussing the engagement first. She felt they were moving too quickly.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The woman did say yes, but then changed her mind. The author might have made assumptions based on her initial acceptance. However, he did plan the proposal without prior discussion about their engagement plans. Maybe he assumed commitment without confirming it. \n\nOn the other hand, once she said yes, even if it was public, she then pulled back, which is hurtful. The author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. But maybe the woman wasn't ready, and the author didn't give her space to process. However, after she said yes, retracting it was a big betrayal. \n\nIs the author wrong? He might have made a mistake by not discussing the proposal details beforehand, but once she accepted, her retracting it was a big issue. So, both have some fault. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer could be B, no, because the woman's actions after accepting were problematic. The author's decision to end the relationship might be justified given her insensitivity in leading him on.\n"
