She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a proposal on a cruise, where the girlfriend said yes but then changed her mind, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it first. The girlfriend felt he moved too fast and wasn't ready. She said yes initially but then changed her mind, which hurt him. He ended the relationship because of her insensitivity.\n\nThe author argues that she led him on by saying yes and then backing out. The girlfriend's perspective is that he didn't talk to her about the proposal beforehand and they were moving too quickly. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he hadn't discussed the proposal with her first, maybe he didn't consider her readiness. However, once she said yes and then changed her mind, that's a significant betrayal of trust. She might have realized her feelings weren't serious enough, but the way she handled it\u2014saying yes in public and then retracting\u2014could be seen as insincere.\n\nThe author ended the relationship, which is understandable given the emotional pain. But was he wrong for not discussing the proposal first? Possibly. Proposals are a big step, and checking in with her about readiness would have been prudent. On the other hand, her retracting her consent after saying yes is a major issue. \n\nBalancing both sides: he made a mistake by not talking to her about the proposal, but her actions of leading him on afterward were worse. The key question is whether the author is entirely in the wrong. Since he had a right to feel betrayed, but also had a responsibility to communicate better, it's a nuanced situation. However, her actions were more hurtful and insincere, so the blame isn't entirely on him. Therefore, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong.\n"
