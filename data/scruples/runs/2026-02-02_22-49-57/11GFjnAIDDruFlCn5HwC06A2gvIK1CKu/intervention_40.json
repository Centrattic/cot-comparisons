      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he proposed during a cruise, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with his girlfriend first. She said yes but then backed out, leading to the breakup. The key points here are communication and expectations. \n\nOn the author's side, he was excited and set up a big proposal. He might have thought she was ready, especially since she said yes. But she felt he moved too fast without discussing the engagement first. Her changing her mind could be due to feeling pressured or not being ready for marriage, even if she was happy with their relationship. \n\nFrom her perspective, agreeing in the moment might have been a reaction to the surprise proposal. She might not have had time to think it through properly. She could feel that the public proposal was a pressure tactic, making her feel obligated to say yes even if she wasn't certain. Her changing her mind later shows that maybe she wasn't ready, but the way she handled it\u2014saying yes then backing out\u2014could be hurtful.\n\nThe author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. He was broken-hearted when she changed her mind. Her not being able to listen to his side and attributing it to him moving too fast might have been a valid point. However, the author might have also contributed by not discussing the proposal beforehand. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he proposed without talking about the future first, that could have led to her feeling blindsided. Even if he believed she was ready, not checking in with her first could be a misstep. Her reaction was to retract her consent, which is her right, but the way she handled it (saying yes then backing out) might have been the issue. \n\nThe author's decision to end the relationship because of her insensitivity makes sense if he felt betrayed. However, the root problem might be a lack of communication from both sides. He didn't talk about the proposal, and she didn't communicate her readiness beforehand. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he didn't discuss the proposal with her first, he might have assumed she was ready without confirming. That could be a fault. On the other hand, she changed her mind after saying yes, which is hurtful. It's a complex situation where both parties have some responsibility. But if the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering he didn't communicate his plan and she didn't express her readiness, maybe there's a balance. \n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the author isn't wrong. I need to decide based on the analysis. The answer could be B (No) because the author was acting on his emotions and didn't communicate the proposal beforehand, which might have contributed to the misunderstanding. However, she also didn't communicate her feelings properly. But the main question is whether he's in the wrong. If he planned a public proposal without discussing it, he might have some fault in not considering her readiness. But if the main issue is her retracting her consent after saying yes, she's more at fault. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Given that both have some responsibility, but the primary issue is her changing her mind after the proposal, maybe the answer is B. But I need to be careful. Alternatively, the answer could be A if the author's lack of communication is the main problem. Hmm.\n"
