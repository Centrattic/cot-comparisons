      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is at fault in the situation where his girlfriend said yes to a proposal but then changed her mind. The author is wondering if he's the asshole (AITA) or if she is.\n\nFirst, the key facts here: the author proposed on a cruise, set up a public proposal with a photographer, and the girlfriend initially said yes but later didn't want to marry him. The author was upset and ended the relationship, feeling that she was insincere.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that the proposal was too public and that they were moving too quickly. She didn't discuss the idea of engagement with him first, so she felt pressured. The author's point is that she should have communicated her feelings earlier instead of leading him on.\n\nNow, thinking about it, proposing is a big step that requires serious communication. If the author planned a public proposal without first talking about the engagement, maybe he didn't consider his partner's readiness. Proposals should ideally be preceded by open discussions about each other's feelings and the future of the relationship. If the author didn't have that conversation and just went ahead with a dramatic proposal, that could be seen as pressure on the girlfriend to make a decision in the moment. \n\nHer changing her mind after saying yes might be hurtful, but the context here is that she felt the proposal was premature and not discussed beforehand. Insensitivity is mentioned by the author, but maybe the root issue is a lack of communication from both sides. The author might have assumed she was ready without confirming, and she might not have expressed her hesitation clearly. \n\nEnding the relationship because she changed her mind is a big decision. The author felt betrayed, but if the proposal was indeed a surprise without prior discussion, the girlfriend might have given an answer under unexpected pressure. In that case, the author could be in the wrong for not having that conversation first. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his intentions in advance, leading to a situation where the girlfriend might not have had the chance to express her true feelings until the moment.\n"
