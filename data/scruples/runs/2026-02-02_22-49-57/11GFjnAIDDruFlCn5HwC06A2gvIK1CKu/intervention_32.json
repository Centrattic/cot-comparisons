      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author proposed during a cruise, got a yes, but then the girlfriend changed her mind. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author set up a public proposal, which can be a big move. Proposing in front of others, even if it's just a photographer, can put pressure on the other person. The girlfriend said she wasn't ready and thought they were moving too fast. She blamed the author for not discussing the engagement first. \n\nOn the other hand, the author felt betrayed because she initially said yes, leading to their celebration, and then changed her mind. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, proposing is a significant step. If he didn't talk about the future or engagement plans beforehand, maybe he rushed things. Public proposals can also be seen as presumptuous if the other person isn't ready. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be a bit harsh. Once he proposed and she said yes, even if she later changed her mind, retracting a yes after the fact is complicated. \n\nThe key points here are communication and consent. The author didn't discuss the proposal with her first, which might have been a misstep. But after she said yes and then changed her mind, maybe she was the one who wasn't ready. The author ending the relationship because of her insensitivity could be justified if he felt hurt and she wasn't taking his feelings into account. \n\nBut wait, if she said yes and then changed her mind, maybe she was the one being insensitve by leading him on. The author's reaction seems valid because he was emotionally invested when she agreed, and then felt rejected later. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he didn't communicate his intent to propose beforehand, maybe he did rush things. But once she said yes, even if she changed her mind, she might be in the wrong. However, the situation is a bit nuanced. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. \n\nI think the answer would be B (No), because while the author might have rushed the proposal, the girlfriend's actions of retracting her consent after the fact and not being honest about her feelings might be more at fault. The author ending the relationship because of her insensitivity seems justified given the emotional impact.\n"
