      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who proposed (the author) is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author proposed during a cruise in a public setup, and the girlfriend said yes. But later, she changed her mind and didn't want to marry him. The author is upset, ended the relationship, and is asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a public proposal, which might have been a surprise. The girlfriend agreed at the moment but later changed her mind. The author feels she led him on and didn't communicate her true feelings. She says it was his fault for moving too quickly without discussing the engagement first. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Proposing can be a big step, and if the couple hasn't discussed marriage or the future, maybe the author did move too fast. But on the other hand, the girlfriend said yes and then changed her mind. That could be seen as insincere. However, people can have moments of panic or pressure in the moment. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument is that the public proposal without prior discussion made her feel pressured. The author's argument is that she should have communicated her readiness earlier. So who's at fault? Maybe both have a point. The author could have discussed the proposal more, and the girlfriend might have been more honest about her feelings. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, but maybe he didn't take responsibility for his part. If the author didn't check in with her about her feelings before proposing, that's a problem. However, after she said yes and then changed her mind, that's her issue. \n\nI think the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author acted based on the yes he received, and the girlfriend changed her mind after committing to the proposal. However, some might argue that the author should have had more communication. But the main issue here is the woman changing her mind after accepting, which is hurtful. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, the fact that he planned a public proposal without discussing it first might have contributed. If they hadn't talked about marriage, that was his fault. The girlfriend's response is valid in that she felt rushed. But the author is asking if he's in the wrong. If the question is whether he's at fault for ending the relationship, maybe not. But if the question is about the proposal setup, maybe he is partially at fault. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the answer is A or B. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, AITA threads often consider the lack of communication as a mistake. The author didn't discuss the proposal with her first, which could be a misstep. But the girlfriend's reaction of changing her mind after saying yes is also problematic. So maybe it's a mix. However, the user is to pick between A or B. \n\nI think the main issue here is that the author didn't talk about the proposal with her first, which is a significant step. So he's partially at fault. However, her changing her mind afterward is also a problem. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is B (Not in the wrong), then the answer would be B. But if the lack of communication is a fault, then A. \n\nIn AITA contexts, often the person who made a sudden, big decision without discussing it with their partner is seen as at least partially at fault. So the author might be in the wrong for the proposal setup. However, the girlfriend's actions after the proposal are also a problem. But the question is about the author's actions leading to the situation. \n\nSo the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) for not discussing the proposal first, which led to the girlfriend feeling pressured. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's refusal to acknowledge the author's pain might be her fault too. \n\nOverall, I think the key point is the lack of communication. The author didn't check in with her about wanting to get married before proposing. So the answer is A. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B because the girlfriend changed her mind after accepting. But in that case, the author is not in the wrong for ending the relationship due to her insensitivity. \n\nHmm. This is a bit tricky. Maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because the woman changed her mind after saying yes, which is her fault. The author acted based on her initial acceptance. So the answer would be B. But if the author didn't communicate before the proposal, that's a problem. But the question is about the situation as a whole. The user is the author, and he ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. \n\nIn AITA, the person is often expected to take responsibility. Here, the author didn't discuss the proposal with her, which is a big step. So he's at fault for that. However, the girlfriend's actions are also a problem. But the answer is either A or B. Given that the author didn't have the discussion first, which is a mistake, the answer is A. But others might think the main issue is the woman's change of heart. \n\nI think in this case, the author is in the wrong for not discussing the proposal with her first, which led to her feeling pressured. So the answer is A. However, if the focus is on the woman's change of mind, then B. But I think the lack of communication is the main issue here, so A.\n"
