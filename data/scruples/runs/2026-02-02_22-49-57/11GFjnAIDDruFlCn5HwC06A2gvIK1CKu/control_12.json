      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship after their girlfriend took back her \"yes\" during a proposal.\n\nSo, the situation is: the author planned a public proposal on a cruise. The girlfriend said yes, but later changed her mind. The author felt broken and ended things because of her insensitivity. The girlfriend blamed him for moving too quickly without discussing the engagement first.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author put a lot of effort into planning the proposal, which the girlfriend didn't seem to anticipate. She said yes initially but then changed her mind. That's a big deal. The author felt hurt and ended the relationship because they couldn't overlook the insensitivity. The girlfriend's reasoning was about moving too quickly and not discussing engagement first.\n\nNow, was the author in the wrong? Well, proposing is a significant step. The girlfriend's argument is that they didn't discuss the engagement first. The author didn't consider discussing engagement before the proposal, which could have been a mistake. However, once she said yes and then changed her mind, that's where the conflict arises. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual readiness. The author didn't discuss engagement plans beforehand, which the girlfriend found rushed. But after the proposal, she went back on her acceptance, which caused emotional pain. The author ended the relationship because he felt led on.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The author's failure to discuss engagement first might be a valid point, but once the proposal happened and she retracted her acceptance, that's a betrayal of trust. The girlfriend's refusal to acknowledge the hurt and her deflection onto the author's approach could be seen as insensitivity. The author's decision to end things because of this might be justified, given the emotional impact.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The girlfriend's actions of taking back her \"yes\" and not being honest about her feelings from the start were the primary issues. The author's mistake was not discussing engagement plans first, but the main fault lies with the girlfriend for changing her mind after accepting the proposal and not being upfront.\n"
