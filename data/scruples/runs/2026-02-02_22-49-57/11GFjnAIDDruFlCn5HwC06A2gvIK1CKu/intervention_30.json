I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their girlfriend took back her \"yes\" to his proposal. The situation is pretty clear: he planned a public proposal, she said yes during the proposal, then later changed her mind. He's upset and ended the relationship, saying he can't overlook her insensitivity. She, on the other hand, claims it was his fault for moving too quickly without discussing the engagement first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a big, public proposal, which might have been a surprise. But maybe he didn't discuss his intentions with her beforehand. She said they were moving too quickly and she wasn't ready, which is a valid concern. Her changing her mind after saying yes could be seen as hurtful, but if she felt pressured, that's on him. \n\nThe key points here are communication and consent. Proposing in a public setting without prior discussion might have put pressure on her, making her feel like she had to say yes in the moment. Then she realized it wasn't what she wanted. He might have assumed she was ready, but if she wasn't, that's a problem. However, after the proposal, she retracted her acceptance, which is a big deal. The author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, but she blamed him for moving too fast.\n\nSo, who's at fault? If he didn't talk to her about the proposal and engagement plans, that's his mistake. But her going back on her word after a yes is also hurtful. The question is whether he's in the wrong by planning the proposal without discussing it. The user thinks he's not in the wrong, but I need to assess if his actions contributed to the problem. Public proposals can be romantic, but they should ideally be preceded by conversations to ensure both people are on the same page. If he didn't do that, he might share some responsibility. However, her retracting her acceptance after the fact is a significant betrayal of trust. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's actions (planning the proposal without prior discussion) were wrong. If he didn't communicate his intentions, that's a flaw. But if he had discussed it and she still said yes, then her changing her mind is her issue. Since the text doesn't mention prior discussion, the fault might lie with him for not checking in with her before the proposal. However, her actions after the yes are also problematic. \n\nBut the user asks if the author is in the wrong. Given the information, the answer is probably B (No), because while he could have handled it better, the main issue is her retracting the yes. But some might argue that his lack of communication was the root cause. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong now, not just the cause. Since she changed her mind and he ended the relationship, it's a mutual issue, but the user's stance is that he's not wrong. I think the answer is B.\n"
