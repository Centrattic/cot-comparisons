      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author proposed to his girlfriend during a cruise with a setup, and she said yes. But then later changed her mind and didn't want to marry him. The author ended the relationship because he felt hurt and thought she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a public proposal, which might have been a surprise. The girlfriend said yes but then changed her mind, leading to the breakup. The author is asking if he's at fault here.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he put a lot into planning the proposal, and when she changed her mind after accepting, it was a big emotional letdown. He might feel that she should have been honest from the start if she wasn't ready. On the other hand, the girlfriend argued that the public proposal was a problem because they didn't discuss engagement first. She might feel that the author moved too quickly without checking in with her about their future plans.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Proposing without prior discussion could be seen as moving too fast, especially if the other person wasn't ready. However, the girlfriend did say yes initially, so maybe she was caught off guard by the sudden proposal. But then changing her mind after accepting could be hurtful and insincere. The author ending the relationship because of this seems like a valid reaction given the emotional pain.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is at fault. If the girlfriend felt that the proposal was rushed without discussing their readiness, the author might have been negligent in not having that conversation first. However, she did accept the proposal, which could imply that she was okay with moving forward at that moment. Changing her mind later could be seen as not being truthful about her feelings.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. Both parties might share some responsibility. The author didn't discuss engagement terms, and the girlfriend didn't communicate her hesitation earlier. However, since the question is specifically about the author's fault, it's possible that he did have some responsibility in not checking in before proposing publicly. But she also didn't clarify her feelings at the time. \n\nIn the end, the author's decision to end the relationship might be justified given the betrayal of trust from the girlfriend changing her mind. So maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong (B). But I need to be careful here. The main issue is whether the author is at fault. If the girlfriend's main argument is that he moved too fast without discussion, then the author might share some blame. However, her changing her mind after accepting is the main issue. The answer might depend on cultural norms or personal values. But according to the story, the author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, which could be valid. So I think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
