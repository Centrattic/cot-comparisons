      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe person proposed during a cruise with a setup, including a photographer. The girlfriend said yes, they celebrated, but then later she changed her mind. The proposer is upset because she didn't want to marry him after all. The main points of contention here are: he planned a public proposal without discussing it with her first, and she changed her mind after accepting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, planning a proposal without prior discussion might come off as presumptuous. Marriage is a big step, and if he didn't talk to her about wanting to get married before setting up the proposal, that could be a problem. It's possible she felt pressured or caught off guard. She might have said yes in the moment due to the emotional setup but wasn't actually ready for the commitment.\n\nOn the other hand, he believed she had accepted his proposal, which is a major commitment. Her taking it back after celebrating and then blaming him for moving too quickly could be seen as insensitivity. He ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her \"insensitivity,\" which he felt was leading him on.\n\nThe key question is whether he's in the wrong for not discussing engagement plans first. Proposing is a big step, and while some people might be okay with a surprise proposal, others might prefer to have the conversation beforehand. It's possible that not discussing it first made her feel that he wasn't respecting her autonomy or that he was assuming she was ready for marriage without checking in with her.\n\nHowever, her reaction after saying yes might also be a problem. Once she accepted, changing her mind after the fact could be hurtful, regardless of how the proposal was handled. Breaking off the relationship because she didn't follow through on her acceptance could be seen as justified if he felt betrayed, but it's also a significant decision.\n\nI need to consider cultural or societal norms here. In some contexts, a surprise proposal is perfectly acceptable. But if the couple was already in a committed relationship, the step to marriage might require more discussion. The fact that she later said they were moving too quickly suggests that maybe the proposal did come as a surprise in terms of their relationship's progression.\n\nAlso, the immediate breakup because of her taking back the \"yes\" might be harsh. But he could feel that her insensitivity in changing her mind after accepting is unforgivable. There's a balance between respecting personal boundaries and the emotional impact of such a reversal.\n\nSo, is he at fault? If he didn't discuss the proposal with her first, that's a point against him. But her changing her mind after accepting is also problematic. However, the main question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user's answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nIf the community typically sides with the proposer in such situations, maybe the answer is B. But if the issue is that he didn't discuss it first, then maybe A. However, the question is about who is more in the wrong. The original poster is asking if he's in the wrong. The answer could be B (No) because both have valid points, but the main fault might lie with the ex for changing her mind after accepting. Alternatively, if the fault is on the proposer for not discussing it first, then A. But I think the key here is that the proposer's actions might have contributed to her pressure, but the ex's change of heart is also a significant issue. However, the problem statement frames the question as whether the author (the proposer) is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether not discussing the proposal first is considered a mistake. In many cases, people might argue that the proposer should have had the conversation first, which would make him at fault (A). But others might say that a surprise proposal is okay, and the fault is on the ex for changing her mind (B). It's a bit of a grey area. But given the way the situation is presented, the proposer might not be entirely wrong, but maybe the main issue is with the ex. However, the answer is likely B (No), meaning the author is not in the wrong, because the ex is the one who changed her mind. But this is tricky. Alternatively, since he didn't discuss the proposal first, he's partially at fault. The community often might say he's not in the wrong because she changed her mind after accepting. So maybe B is the answer.\n"
