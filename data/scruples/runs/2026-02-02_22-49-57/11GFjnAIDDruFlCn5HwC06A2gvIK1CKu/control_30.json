      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy proposed on a cruise, the girl said yes, then later changed her mind. He feels broken and ended the relationship because he thinks she was insensitive. She, on the other hand, says it was his fault for not discussing the proposal first and that they were moving too fast.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy planned a public proposal without talking to her about it first. That might have been a mistake because a marriage proposal is a big step and should involve mutual discussion. By planning it without discussing their future together, he might have assumed she was ready, which she wasn't. That could explain her saying \"yes\" in the moment but then realizing she wasn't ready. \n\nOn the other hand, when she changed her mind after saying yes, that's hurtful and not something to take lightly. She didn't follow through, which caused him emotional pain. She also didn't want to listen to his feelings, which shows a lack of empathy. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The guy didn't discuss the proposal with her first, which is a significant step. That could be a problem because proposing without that conversation might have been presumptuous. However, the girl's reaction of changing her mind and not being empathetic is also problematic. \n\nBut in terms of who is more at fault, the initial mistake might lie with the guy for not having the conversation first. If they had discussed their feelings and future plans, maybe they could have avoided this situation. That said, her response was also hurtful. \n\nThe user is asking if the author (the guy) is in the wrong. Since the question is whether he is in the wrong, and the answer choices are A (Yes) or B (No). If the main issue is that he didn't communicate his intentions first, then he is partially at fault. But the girl's actions also contributed. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. \n\nIn the context of the question, the answer might hinge on whether the lack of prior communication was a mistake. If the answer is A (Yes), that would mean the author is in the wrong. If B (No), then he's not. \n\nI think the key here is that the girl changed her mind after saying yes, which is a major issue, but the guy also didn't discuss it beforehand. However, the responsibility for her changing her mind later is on her. The fact that he ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity suggests that he felt wronged. But if the root cause was his lack of communication, then he shares some blame. \n\nBut in many relationships, proposing is a big step, and while communication is important, it's not always discussed in advance. However, if she wasn't prepared for that step, then the proposal might have been premature. So the guy might be in the wrong for not discussing it first. \n\nBut the girl's reaction is also problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the main issue is his lack of communication, then answer A. Otherwise, answer B. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes) because he didn't talk to her about it first, leading to her confusion and then changing her mind. So he shares some responsibility.\n"
