I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after his girlfriend took back her \"yes\" during a proposal. \n\nFirst, the author planned a public proposal without discussing it with her first. The girlfriend initially said yes but then changed her mind. The author feels betrayed and ended the relationship. The girlfriend's side is that the proposal was too rushed and public, leading her to feel pressured.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author's action of planning a public proposal without prior discussion might have assumed her readiness for marriage. On the other hand, the girlfriend changed her mind after accepting, which could be seen as insensitivity. \n\nBut in relationships, communication is key. If the author didn't discuss the proposal with her beforehand, he might have misread her readiness. However, the girlfriend's decision to take back her acceptance after saying yes could be hurtful. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I should weigh whether the author's actions were a mistake. Public proposals can be exciting but might not consider the other person's feelings if they're not prepared. The girlfriend's reaction shows she wasn't ready, but retracting a \"yes\" is a big deal. \n\nUltimately, both parties might share some responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the proposal wasn't discussed, he might have acted impulsively. However, the immediate breakup after such a letdown could be his response. It's a tough call. The answer might be B (No), but there's nuance here.\n"
