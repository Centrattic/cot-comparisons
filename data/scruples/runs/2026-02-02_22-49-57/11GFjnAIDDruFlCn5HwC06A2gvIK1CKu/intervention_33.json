      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that was accepted but then revoked. The author set up a public proposal without discussing it with the girlfriend first. She said yes during the proposal but later changed her mind. He felt betrayed and ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to propose, which is a significant step. Planning a public proposal without prior discussion might have been impulsive. The girlfriend might not have been ready, and the sudden public setting could have pressured her to say yes. However, once she said yes, backing out later caused emotional harm. \n\nThe girlfriend's response was that the author moved too quickly. She might not have been prepared for marriage and felt caught off guard. But once she accepted, she had a responsibility to honor that commitment. Her changing her mind after the fact might be seen as insincere or not taking the engagement seriously. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have been more sensitive by discussing the proposal first. Public proposals can be overwhelming, and maybe a private setting would have allowed for a more genuine response. His emotional reaction is understandable, but ending the relationship because of her change of heart might be harsh, especially if there were underlying issues like readiness for marriage. \n\nHowever, after she said yes, her decision to take it back was a betrayal of trust. The author's anger stems from feeling manipulated. While both could have handled things better, the final decision to end the relationship is his choice, and he's not necessarily wrong for prioritizing his emotional well-being. \n\nSo, considering the key points: the public proposal without discussion could be a misstep, but her retracting the acceptance after saying yes is more problematic. The author's reaction is justified given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
