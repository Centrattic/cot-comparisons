I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who proposed is in the wrong after their partner changed her mind. The scenario is that he planned a public proposal, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He ended the relationship because he felt she led him on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The man set up a big proposal, which is a significant moment. He might have expected her to be certain. She, on the other hand, felt they were moving too fast and didn't discuss the engagement first. Her hesitation after saying yes could be seen as not being ready, but is that her fault?\n\nFrom his perspective, planning a public proposal without discussing it first might have put her on the spot. Maybe she felt pressured. But he argues she should have been honest earlier. She says it was his fault for not talking about it. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he didn't discuss engagement plans with her before the proposal, that's a valid point. Proposing without talking about it first might have been a misstep, making her feel surprised or pressured. However, her changing her mind after saying yes is also a problem. Once she said yes, retracting it could be hurtful, especially in a public setting. \n\nThe man ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity. But maybe he should have handled the proposal differently. Alternatively, maybe she should have been more clear about her feelings before the proposal. \n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but I need to assess both. If the man didn't discuss engagement with her first, maybe he's partially at fault. But she changed her mind after the proposal, which is also a problem. \n\nIn terms of answer choices, A is the author is wrong, B is not. Considering that he didn't communicate his intentions first, which led to her confusion, but she also didn't clarify her feelings. It's a bit of a 50-50. However, traditionally, proposals are a big step, and not discussing it beforehand could be seen as his mistake. But she retracted her acceptance, which is hurtful. \n\nI think the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the woman changed her mind after agreeing. However, if the man didn't talk about it first, that's a flaw. But the woman's actions after the proposal are more directly at fault. So maybe B is the answer here.\n"
