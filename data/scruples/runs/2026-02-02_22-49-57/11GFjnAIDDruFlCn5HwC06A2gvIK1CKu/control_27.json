      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong. The author proposed on a cruise, set up a big public proposal with a photographer, and the girlfriend said yes but then changed her mind. The author feels hurt and ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author did plan a public proposal without discussing it first. Maybe he assumed she would say yes, and that's where the problem is. The girlfriend said they were moving too quickly and she wasn't ready. That's a common reason people might back out. She might feel pressured by the public setup. \n\nThe author is upset because she didn't follow through after the \"yes.\" But she might have felt overwhelmed. Did he give her enough time to process? The girlfriend's reaction is that it was his fault for not discussing engagement first. So, maybe he didn't communicate his intentions properly. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he wanted to get engaged, he should have talked to her about it, not just pop the question in a big public way. She might not have been ready for that level of commitment, and the public proposal could have made her feel cornered. \n\nThe author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. But is that fair? He might be reacting to his hurt feelings, but she did explain her side. However, she didn't take back the engagement immediately; she dropped the ball after the yes. That's confusing. Maybe she realized later that she wasn't ready. \n\nSo, who's at fault? The author didn't discuss the proposal with her first, leading to her shock. She then changed her mind, which hurt him. He ended the relationship because he felt betrayed. Both have points. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the author made a mistake by not talking to her about wanting to get engaged before proposing. Public proposals can be stressful. If he had discussed it, maybe she could have been honest about not being ready. So, he's partly at fault. But she also led him on by saying yes and then changing her mind. However, the main issue here is about his actions leading up to the proposal. \n\nThe answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his intentions properly, leading to the situation where she felt pressured and then changed her mind. His lack of communication contributed to the problem.\n"
