I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who proposed is in the wrong after the girlfriend changed her mind. So, the situation is that he planned a big public proposal on a cruise, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He feels hurt and ended the relationship, asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The proposer set up a public proposal, which can be a big deal. Some might say he should have discussed it with her first. Proposals are significant, and doing it without prior conversation could lead to pressure or unexpected reactions. She might have felt caught off guard, leading her to say yes impulsively but then reconsider.\n\nOn the other hand, she changed her mind after the yes. That's a huge deal. Once someone says yes, even if it's impulsive, it's a commitment. She might have not been ready, but retracting after accepting could be seen as inconsiderate. He trusted her, and her change of heart led to emotional pain.\n\nThe proposer ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. He points out that she led him on. She blames him for moving too fast. It's a conflict of perspectives. Legally, there's no binding contract, so he's not wrong in a legal sense. But emotionally, both have valid points. He acted on her initial acceptance, and she wasn't ready. But he also might have approached it without considering if she was ready for marriage.\n\nThe question is if he's in the wrong. If he didn't discuss the proposal with her beforehand, maybe he rushed things. However, after she said yes and then changed her mind, that's a betrayal of trust. So, maybe the main fault is hers for retracting her commitment. But the initial setup could contribute to the problem. However, the user's friend (the author) ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, and I need to agree or disagree.\n\nIn the AITA community, often the person who changed their mind after a yes is seen as more at fault. But the setup of the proposal without discussion might also be a point. But the core issue here is the retraction after accepting. So, probably the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because she changed her mind after accepting. However, maybe there's a nuance where both are partially at fault. But the user's question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he ended the relationship due to her actions, and she retracted her acceptance, the main fault is hers. So answer B.\n"
