      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author proposed on a cruise in a public way, the girlfriend said yes but then changed her mind. The author ended the relationship, and now he's wondering if he's the a**hole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author planned a public proposal with a photographer, and the girlfriend initially said yes but later didn't want to marry him. He felt betrayed and ended the relationship. The girlfriend's response was that he moved too quickly without discussing engagement first and that the public proposal was his fault. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. From the author's perspective, he did a big proposal, set up a romantic gesture, and when she changed her mind, he felt led on. He ended it because he couldn't overlook the insensitivity. From her side, she might have felt pressured by the public proposal and wasn't ready for marriage, so she regretted the yes. \n\nIs the author wrong for proposing without discussing it first? Proposals are big steps, and while some people might want to plan a surprise, others might expect a more private conversation. The girlfriend might have felt that the lack of discussion made her feel like the proposal was sudden, leading her to say yes in the moment but not be serious. \n\nThen there's the issue of taking back a \"yes.\" Once someone says yes, is it expected to be final? In some cases, people might say yes in the heat of the moment but later realize they aren't ready. However, the girlfriend's reason for changing her mind was that they were moving too fast, so maybe the author did move without her input. \n\nThe author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. But is it insensitivity to change your mind after a proposal, especially if the proposal wasn't discussed ahead of time? Or is the author's reaction also heavy-handed? \n\nAlso, the girlfriend taking back her yes might not be insensitivity but rather a realization she wasn't ready. The author's setup might have been too public, leading her to feel pressured to say yes in the moment. \n\nSo, the author might have contributed to the problem by not having that crucial conversation beforehand. Proposing in a public setting without checking in with her about readiness for marriage could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, he might share some responsibility, making him at least partially in the wrong. But the girlfriend's response of taking back the yes after the engagement and causing emotional pain is also a factor. \n\nI need to decide if the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). The key here is whether the author's actions were wrong in leading to the situation. Since proposals are typically meant to be sincere and serious, the girlfriend taking it back after the fact is a big deal, but the author's approach might have been a misstep. However, the main issue is the girlfriend's change of heart, which isn't necessarily insensitivity. The author's decision to end the relationship might be justified because of the betrayal he felt, but if he didn't discuss the proposal with her first, he could be part of the problem. \n\nIn many relationships, proposing is a significant step, and while surprises can be nice, not discussing the intention to propose might leave the other person unprepared. The girlfriend's reaction could be a result of that lack of discussion. So, maybe the author is somewhat in the wrong for not having that conversation, but the girlfriend's actions are also problematic. However, the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but others might say he is. \n\nBut the main point here is that the girlfriend took back her yes, which is a big deal. The author's argument is that she should have been honest instead of leading him on. If she truly wasn't ready for marriage, maybe she should have communicated that before the proposal. But if the proposal was a surprise, she might not have had the chance. So, the author's fault could be not discussing it first, leading her to feel caught off guard. \n\nIn that case, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) for not having the discussion before the proposal. However, I'm not entirely sure. The girlfriend taking back the yes is also a major issue. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If he's not, then B. But if the lack of discussion is a problem, then A. \n\nI think the answer is A because the proposal should have been discussed beforehand to ensure both parties are ready. The author didn't do that, leading to her changing her mind. So, the author is in the wrong for not having that conversation, which contributed to the problem. However, the girlfriend's actions are also part of the issue. But since the question is about the author's responsibility, the answer might be A.\n"
