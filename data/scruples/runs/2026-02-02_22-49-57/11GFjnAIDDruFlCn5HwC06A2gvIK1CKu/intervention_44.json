      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully. The author proposed to his girlfriend on a cruise, set it up with a photographer, and she said yes. They celebrated with champagne and pictures, but then later she changed her mind and didn't want to marry him. He was really upset, cried, and ended the relationship because he found her insensitivity unforgivable. She argued that he was wrong to plan a public proposal without discussing the engagement first, saying they were moving too quickly.\n\nHmm, the question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, proposing is a big step, especially in a public way. Maybe he should have had an honest conversation about their future before doing something so dramatic. Proposing without discussing the engagement might have put pressure on her, leading to a yes she wasn't ready to commit to. But on the other hand, she said yes and then took it back. That seems really hurtful. He was genuinely excited and maybe didn't expect her to change her mind after celebrating. \n\nWait, the user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but I'm supposed to determine if that's the case. So, considering communication: did he have the conversation? He set up a public proposal, which might not be the best approach if they haven't talked about marriage first. Maybe he assumed she wanted to get married, and she felt pressured into saying yes. Then when she took it back, he felt betrayed, but she might have felt rushed. \n\nBut then again, after she said yes, they went through the celebration. That could imply she was committed at that point. However, her reasoning is that she wasn't ready, and she didn't want to actually marry him. So maybe she wasn't being insincere initially but realized it later. The problem here is that the proposal was a surprise, and she didn't have time to process if they were ready for that step. \n\nThe author ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity. That's a strong reaction. But if she did lead him on by accepting the proposal and then changing her mind, he's justified in feeling hurt. However, she also claims it was his fault for not discussing it first. So both sides have some responsibility. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the A**hole) scenarios, usually the focus is on whether the person's actions were the main issue. The author didn't ask her if she wanted to get engaged first, which might be a red flag. Proposing as a surprise without prior discussion could be seen as a mistake. But she also went through with the yes and then changed her mind. That's her prerogative, but it's a big step. \n\nI think the key point is that the author didn't have that conversation. Even if she later changed her mind, not discussing the engagement first might have contributed to the situation. So maybe the author is partially at fault. But then, she did say yes and then take it back, which is also a problem. However, in relationship dynamics, communication is crucial. If he had asked her first, maybe they could have resolved this without the proposal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she's the one in the wrong for changing her mind after accepting. But people can change their minds, especially about such a big decision. If the proposal was a surprise and she wasn't ready, even if she said yes, maybe that's her doing. But the author's reaction to ending the relationship because of her insensitivity... that's a harsh call. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the lack of communication before proposing is a bigger issue than her retracting her acceptance. I think in this case, both parties share some responsibility. The author should have discussed the engagement first, and she should have been more honest about her feelings. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the main issue is the public proposal without prior discussion, then maybe the author is partially at fault. However, the question is phrased as a yes/no for the author being in the wrong. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being entirely in the wrong. She did say yes, which he took as a commitment. Her retraction after celebrating might be the bigger issue. But I'm not 100% sure. Some might argue that a big proposal like that without talking first is the problem. But others might say that once she said yes, going back on it is the worse action. \n\nGiven that, the answer could be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the woman changed her mind after accepting, which is a betrayal. But there's also the aspect of the proposal being a surprise without discussion. However, the user's perspective is that the author is in the right. Maybe the consensus here is similar. So I think the answer is B.\n"
