I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his ex after she said yes to the proposal but then changed her mind.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author planned a public proposal during a cruise, set up with a photographer. The girlfriend said yes, they celebrated, then later she changed her mind, not wanting to marry him. The author was heartbroken and ended the relationship, blaming her for insensitivity. She said it was his fault for not discussing the engagement first and moving too quickly.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the proposal was public, maybe without prior discussion. She agreed, then changed her mind. He ended the relationship because of her \"insensitivity.\" She claims the problem was his approach.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I should consider both sides. Was the proposal a surprise without discussing it first? That could be an issue because a proposal is a big step, and ideally, both partners should be on the same page. However, the girlfriend changed her mind after saying yes, which is really hurtful. The author was devastated and ended things, which is a valid reaction if he felt betrayed.\n\nBut is the author at fault for not discussing it? Maybe. If he didn't talk about the proposal with her first, he might have assumed she was ready, which she wasn't. That could be his mistake. On the other hand, after she said yes, her retracting it is a major betrayal of trust. The author's reaction is understandable. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend changed her mind after committing, which is a huge issue. The author had every right to feel betrayed and decide to end the relationship. So maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B, No.\n"
