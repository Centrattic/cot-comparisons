I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the guy proposed on a cruise, she said yes, but then changed her mind. He was really hurt and ended the relationship. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From the guy's perspective, he put a lot of effort into the proposal, set up a public event, and she accepted but then backed out. That's really painful. He might feel betrayed because she didn't follow through after saying yes. He ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her \"insensitivity,\" which suggests he felt she led him on.\n\nNow, the girl's side: she said yes, but then realized she wasn't ready. She got upset and blamed him for not discussing the engagement beforehand. She thought they were moving too quickly. Her reasoning is that he didn't talk to her about getting engaged, so she wasn't prepared for the proposal. She might not have realized how committed she was to him at that point.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and expectations. Did the guy have a responsibility to talk about proposing before doing it? Proposals are major life decisions, and maybe he should have discussed it with her first to make sure they were on the same page. If he didn't, then he might be in the wrong for not checking in with her. However, proposing is a common practice, and sometimes people do it without prior discussion, expecting a yes. But given that the girl felt they were moving too quickly, maybe the guy did push her into a decision without ensuring she was ready.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl changed her mind after saying yes, which is hurtful. Once she said yes, breaking that commitment could be seen as insensitivity. But she might have been under pressure in the moment and later realized her true feelings. The problem is that she didn't communicate her hesitation before the proposal. Maybe she should have been more honest about not being ready.\n\nThe guy's reaction to end the relationship because of her change of heart is also a point. He might feel that her actions were a betrayal, but he might also be in the wrong for not talking to her about the engagement first. So, it's a mutual issue. However, the question is specifically about the author (the guy) being in the wrong. If the girl is at fault for changing her mind without cause, then the guy isn't. But if the guy is at fault for not discussing it first, then he's partially in the wrong.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the guy didn't have a conversation about marriage before proposing, he might have made an assumption, which led to the problem. So, maybe he's partially at fault. The girl is also at fault for not being honest about her feelings. But the user is asking if the author (the guy) is in the wrong. If he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, he's in the wrong. If he did, then maybe not. The story says he didn't discuss engagement with her first, which she pointed out as his fault. So, he might be at fault for not having that conversation. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't talk to her about proposing, leading to her feeling pressured and then changing her mind.\n"
