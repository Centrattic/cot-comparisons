      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when his girlfriend took back her \"yes\" after a proposal. The situation is that he proposed on a cruise with a photographer and a public setup, and she initially said yes but later changed her mind. He ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was excited and set up a romantic proposal, which she agreed to in the moment. But after the proposal, she decided not to go through with the marriage. That's a big shift. He feels betrayed and hurt because she led him on. She, on the other hand, is upset because he didn't talk about engagement plans before the proposal and things were moving too fast for her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author make a mistake in proposing without prior discussion? And was her taking back her acceptance justified?\n\nProposing is a significant step, and while it's a personal decision, it's generally considered important to have open communication about the future of the relationship before such a commitment. The author might be in the wrong if he didn't have these conversations and instead made a grand gesture, which could be seen as rushing things. However, the woman changed her mind after accepting, which can be really hurtful. But people can have moments of excitement during the proposal and then later realize they're not ready, which is a common issue.\n\nThe author ended the relationship due to her insensitivity, which is a bit of a contradiction because he was the one who had to deal with the emotional fallout. But he might be reacting to the fact that she didn't communicate her true feelings before the proposal. The question is whether the author's actions were insensitive by not checking in with her about the engagement first.\n\nIt's possible that the author thought the proposal was a natural progression and didn't realize she wasn't ready. But he did not discuss the engagement before the proposal, which could be a misstep. On the other hand, she accepted in the moment but later changed her mind, which is her own issue. The answer might depend on whether the author was expected to have a more open conversation about marriage before proposing. If he didn't do that, he could share some responsibility. But if she didn't communicate her feelings at all, then maybe he's not at fault. The user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, so I should check if that's the case.\n\nIn many relationships, proposing is a big deal, and it's reasonable to expect some prior discussion. However, not all proposals have that. If the author thought she was ready, but she wasn't, then maybe he's not wrong. But if he didn't give her a chance to express her thoughts before the proposal, that could be an issue. The woman's insensitivity is about changing her mind, but perhaps the author could have been more considerate in how he approached the proposal. So, there might be some shared fault, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Considering the response options, the user says he's not, and the question is whether the answer is A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nI think in this case, it's a bit of a gray area, but since the woman changed her mind after accepting, and the author ended it because she was insensitive, the answer might be B because the author is reacting to her lack of communication. However, the author's decision to propose publicly without prior discussion could be seen as part of the problem. But the user is arguing that the author isn't in the wrong, so the answer would be B. But I need to make sure. Let me check if there's a clear right or wrong here. \n\nIn many cases, people do propose without prior discussion, and the acceptor might later decide not to proceed. That's more on the acceptor's side. However, the author's approach might not have respected her need for more time. So maybe there's some fault on both sides. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer usually in these situations is that the person who took back their acceptance is the one at fault. But the user is saying the author isn't. The answer may hinge on whether planning a public proposal without discussing the engagement first is a mistake. If yes, then A. If no, then B. \n\nI think the answer is B because the woman's decision to change her mind after accepting is more problematic. However, the author might not have handled the pre-proposal communication well. But ending the relationship because of her insensitivity could be justified, even if he shares some responsibility. So the answer is B.\n"
