      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after their ex-girlfriend took back her \"yes\" during a proposal. The author proposed publicly, she said yes, but later changed her mind. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a public proposal, which might be a big step. Some people might think he should have discussed the engagement plans more beforehand. The ex said she wasn't ready and they were moving too quickly. She might feel pressured if the engagement wasn't discussed. But she did say yes publicly, which usually signifies commitment. Then changing her mind could be seen as breaking trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt betrayed and ended the relationship, which is a valid reaction to being let down. But maybe he was too quick to end things without further discussion. However, the ex didn't listen and was defensive. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual readiness. The author didn't discuss the proposal plans with her, which she found fault in. She might have felt unprepared for such a public commitment. But after saying yes, backing out could hurt him deeply. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Possibly, for not checking in with her about the proposal before doing it. However, her backing out after agreeing is also a problem. The situation is complex. The answer might depend on cultural norms and expectations around proposals. In many cases, a proposal is a mutual decision, so if she wasn't ready, maybe both are at fault. But the question is about the author's wrongness. Since he didn't discuss the proposal beforehand, maybe he shares some responsibility. But he also had the right to feel hurt and end the relationship. The answer could be that he's not entirely in the wrong, so answer B.\n"
