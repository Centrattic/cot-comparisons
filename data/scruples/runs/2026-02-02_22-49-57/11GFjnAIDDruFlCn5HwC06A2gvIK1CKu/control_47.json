      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal gone wrong. Let me read through the details again carefully.\n\nThe user proposed on a cruise, set up a public proposal with a photographer. The girlfriend said yes, but later changed her mind, saying she didn't actually want to marry him. The user felt broken, cried, and ended the relationship because he thought she was insensitively leading him on. The girlfriend's argument was that the proposal was planned without discussing the engagement first, and they were moving too quickly. The user is asking if he's the a**hole here.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. First, the proposal was public. Public proposals can be exciting but might be seen as putting pressure on the other person. The girlfriend said yes initially but then changed her mind. She claims the problem was that the user didn't discuss engagement with her first, leading them to move too quickly. The user feels she was insincere and led him on.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, proposing is a big step. It's important to have that conversation beforehand. If he didn't discuss the engagement with her first, maybe he didn't give her a chance to express her readiness. Public proposals can be romantic, but they might not be the best way to discuss such a significant decision. The girlfriend might have felt pressured, especially if she wasn't ready to commit. However, saying yes and then changing her mind is also problematic. She might have been caught off guard, or maybe she wasn't honest with herself. But then again, she did say yes initially, so maybe she was just caught up in the moment.\n\nThe user ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. Is that fair? If she was honest about not being ready, maybe the user should have respected that. But she did say yes, which could lead to the user feeling betrayed. Both sides have some responsibility here. The user didn't discuss the proposal, which is a major step. The girlfriend didn't communicate her true feelings beforehand. But after saying yes, retracting it is hurtful. \n\nIn terms of who's more at fault, maybe both share some. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user's actions: public proposal without prior discussion. The girlfriend's actions: leading him on after saying yes. The user ended the relationship, which is his right, but was he in the wrong for not discussing the proposal first? Possibly. However, the girlfriend's retraction after saying yes is also a significant issue. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B), because the girlfriend's actions of saying yes and then changing her mind were insincere and hurtful. However, the user could have handled the proposal differently by discussing it first. But the main issue here is the girlfriend's insensitivity in retracting her \"yes\". So the answer would be B.\n"
