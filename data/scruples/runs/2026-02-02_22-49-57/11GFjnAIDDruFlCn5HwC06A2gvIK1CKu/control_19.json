      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he proposed during a cruise during a show setup, she said yes, but then later changed her mind. He was devastated, cried, and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on. She, on the other hand, said it was his fault for not discussing the proposal and moving too fast.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The man put a lot of effort into planning a public proposal. Public proposals are a big deal, and he was excited. But maybe he didn't talk to her about the engagement first. The question is, is it his fault for not discussing it? Proposals are a significant step, so maybe they should have had that conversation beforehand. If he just assumed she was ready, that could be an issue. \n\nOn her side, she might not have been prepared for the marriage commitment. She said they were moving too quickly. If they hadn't had that discussion about their future plans, maybe he jumped the gun. But then, when she changed her mind after saying yes, that's really painful. She was committed to the proposal at the time but then reversed, which is hard on him. \n\nHis reaction to ending the relationship because of her insensitivity makes sense. He was hurt and felt betrayed. But is he wrong for not discussing the proposal first? Maybe. The proposal is a huge step, and not talking about it beforehand could have led to this situation. However, her changing her mind after a yes is also problematic. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, sometimes people do public proposals without prior discussion, but ideally, both partners should be on the same page. The fact that she didn't stick with her yes is a major issue, but the man's approach might have contributed to the problem. \n\nI think both have some fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't discuss the proposal with her first, maybe he's partially responsible. However, her changing her mind after committing to a proposal is equally wrong. The answer might be that neither is entirely right, but the question is specifically about the author. \n\nThe options are A (Yes, he's wrong) or B (No). Considering that he didn't talk to her about engagement before proposing, which is a key part of the issue she mentioned, maybe he's partially in the wrong. But the main problem is her reversing her decision. However, the question is from his perspective. Since he ended it because of her insensitivity, but his actions (not discussing) contributed, perhaps he's not in the wrong. But maybe he is. It's tricky. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because her changing her mind after a yes is the bigger issue, even if he didn't discuss it beforehand. But others might argue that he should have discussed it. I'm leaning towards B because the main fault is hers for going back on her word, which is more hurtful.\n"
