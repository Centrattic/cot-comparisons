      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy proposed during a cruise, set up a big public proposal with a photographer, and she said yes. Then later, she changed her mind and didn't want to get married. He felt broken, cried, asked why she led him on, and she blamed him for moving too quickly and not discussing the engagement first. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's actions: he planned a public proposal, which is a big step. He might have thought she was ready for marriage, but maybe he didn't talk about it privately first. The girl says they were moving too quickly, and she wasn't ready. So maybe she felt pressured by the public proposal without prior discussion.\n\nOn one hand, proposing is a big decision, and she initially said yes but then changed her mind. That's difficult because the guy was expecting commitment after the yes. But on the other hand, if she felt that the engagement wasn't discussed properly and they were moving too fast, maybe she had valid reasons to rethink.\n\nThe guy ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity. He might feel betrayed, but she also might feel that he didn't give her a chance to communicate her feelings. The key point here is communication. Did he consult with her about wanting to get engaged before planning the proposal? If he didn't, then maybe he did move too quickly. But if he had talked about it and she agreed to the proposal but then changed her mind later, that's different.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong. If he didn't discuss the engagement before the proposal and just went ahead with a public one, that could be seen as pressuring her. But if he had discussed it and she said yes but then retracted, that's another scenario. The story mentions that she said she wasn't ready and it was his fault for not discussing it first. So perhaps he did move too quickly without ensuring she was on board. In that case, he might share some responsibility. However, her retracting the yes after the proposal is also hurtful.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, public proposals can be seen as exciting, but if the partner wasn't ready to commit, it could lead to issues. The guy's reaction is understandable, but ending the relationship because of this might be his way of dealing with the betrayal, but whether it's justified depends on the context.\n\nSo considering all that, maybe the answer is that the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's some nuance. However, the question is asking if he's in the wrong. Since the user thinks he isn't, but I need to decide between A and B. The answer is B (No).\n"
