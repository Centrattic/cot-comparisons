      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a proposal that went wrong. The author planned a big, public proposal on a cruise, got a yes, then later the girlfriend changed her mind. She said it was the author's fault for moving too quickly and not discussing the engagement first. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author put a lot of effort into planning a public proposal, which is a significant step. He probably thought she was ready for marriage. But the girlfriend felt that the proposal was too sudden and that they were moving too fast. She didn't want to get married, even though she said yes initially. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. Public proposals can be seen as a traditional way to ask for marriage, but maybe the girlfriend felt that the author didn't give her enough time to process the idea of marriage. She might have wanted to have more conversations about their future before a public commitment. The author might have assumed she was ready because she said yes, but she later changed her mind, which is really hard on him. \n\nBut from the girlfriend's perspective, she might have felt pressured by the public proposal. Sometimes people feel they have to say yes in the moment, especially in a public setting, even if they're not truly ready. She could have been trying to be polite and not ruin the moment, but later realized she didn't want to go through with it. \n\nThe author ended the relationship because he felt betrayed by her insensitivity. He felt she led him on, which is understandable given the emotional impact of a rejected proposal. However, maybe the author should have had more discussions about their relationship goals before the proposal. Proposing without talking about the future first could be seen as rushing things. \n\nBut here's the thing: even if they had talked, she might still not have been ready. The problem might not be about rushing but about the way the proposal was handled. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the public nature and lack of prior discussion made her feel unprepared. \n\nIn terms of fault, both might have made mistakes. The author might have assumed she was ready without checking in, and the girlfriend might have given a yes under pressure. However, the author's decision to end the relationship because of her insensitivity is a bit harsh. She was in a vulnerable position and might have been struggling with her own emotions. \n\nOn the other hand, she did say yes, which is a commitment, and then changed her mind, which can be very hurtful. The author's feelings of betrayal are valid, but ending the relationship because of her change of heart might be a reaction to the hurt rather than a justified wrong. \n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. He had a right to be hurt and to end the relationship if he couldn't move past it. However, he could have handled things differently. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he acted on his feelings and she changed her mind after agreeing, it's a complex situation. But given the options, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
