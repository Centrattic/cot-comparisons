      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. They proposed on a cruise, set it up with a photographer, and the girlfriend said yes. But then later, she changed her mind and didn't want to actually get married. The author felt hurt, cried, and ended the relationship because they thought she was insensitively leading them on.\n\nFirst, the main points here are the public proposal without prior discussion and the girlfriend's sudden change of heart. The author is asking if they're the a**hole (AITA) or if the girlfriend is. They think they're not in the wrong, but want another opinion.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument is that the public proposal without discussing engagement was her issue. She says they were moving too quickly and she wasn't ready. The author counters that she should have been honest and not led him on. \n\nNow, considering relationships, communication is key. Proposing in a public setting without talking about the idea of marriage beforehand might be a problem. If the author hadn't discussed their future plans, maybe the girlfriend had reservations. However, once she said yes, she then withdrew it, which could be seen as insensitive. \n\nBut wait, maybe the girlfriend felt pressured by the sudden public proposal. People might feel different in the moment of a proposal compared to actually committing to marriage. The author might have assumed she was ready, but she wasn't, even after accepting. So, is the author at fault for not talking about it first, or is the girlfriend at fault for saying yes and then taking it back?\n\nOn one hand, the author didn't have a conversation about marriage before the proposal. On the other hand, once a proposal is accepted, it's a significant commitment. If the girlfriend realized she wasn't ready after saying yes, maybe that's her issue. But if she knew beforehand and just said yes to avoid hurting his feelings, that's different. The story doesn't clarify if she was genuinely surprised or if she had hidden doubts. \n\nThe author ended the relationship immediately, calling her insensitive. That seems harsh, but maybe the girlfriend didn't handle it well either. She might have felt the pressure of the public proposal and accepted without fully considering her feelings. Or she might have been scared and changed her mind. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author could be seen as rushing into the proposal without ensuring mutual readiness. The girlfriend is responsible for her change of heart and not being honest. But the problem is the lack of communication. If the author didn't discuss it first, that's a mistake. But the girlfriend's action of saying yes and then reneging is also problematic. \n\nI think the key here is the setup of the proposal. If the author planned it without talking to her about the engagement, that's a communication breakdown. However, the girlfriend's response after saying yes\u2014possibly not being ready\u2014could be her own fault. It's a bit of a 50/50 situation, but the girlfriend's insensitivity in taking back her \"yes\" after the emotional moment might make her the a**hole. The author might have made a mistake by not discussing it first, but the immediate breakup and the girlfriend's actions after accepting the proposal could tip the scales. \n\nWait, the author ended the relationship right then because they couldn't overlook the insensitivity. Maybe the author acted impulsively. But if the girlfriend's behavior was truly insensitive, then maybe the author was justified. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (No), because the girlfriend's sudden change after saying yes seems to be a bigger issue. The author's mistake was not discussing the engagement first, but the girlfriend's insensitivity in taking back her acceptance is more harmful. However, there's a nuance here. If the girlfriend had communicated her doubts before saying yes, maybe the author would have to take some responsibility. But since she said yes and then changed her mind, that's a problem. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but maybe partially. But the main question is whether they are in the wrong, not just partially. The decision to end the relationship immediately might be seen as harsh, but the girlfriend's actions are worse. So answer B.\n"
