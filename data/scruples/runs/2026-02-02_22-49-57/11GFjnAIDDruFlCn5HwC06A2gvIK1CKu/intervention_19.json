I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong when their girlfriend took back her \"yes\" after a public proposal.\n\nFirst, the author planned a big, public proposal on a cruise with a photographer. The girlfriend initially said yes, then changed her mind. The author felt betrayed and ended the relationship, thinking she was insensitive. The girlfriend argued that the public proposal without discussion made her feel pressured, so she wasn't ready to get married.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author wanted to get engaged and did so in a dramatic way. However, proposing is a significant step, and not discussing the engagement beforehand could have led to the girlfriend feeling unprepared. The girlfriend might have felt pressured by the public setting, which the author didn't consult her about. The girlfriend's change of heart might stem from realizing the hasty decision and not being ready, not necessarily leading the author on. The author's reaction\u2014ending the relationship because of her refusal to accept the proposal\u2014could be seen as a valid response to feeling used, but maybe the root issue was the lack of communication about marriage plans. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author didn't communicate the engagement plans beforehand, that's on them. The girlfriend had the right to change her mind if she wasn't ready. The author might have misread the situation, but the core issue is communication. The answer might be B (No), as the author isn't entirely at fault, but maybe partially responsible for not discussing the proposal. However, the question is about the girlfriend taking back her \"yes\" and the author's reaction. The girlfriend's actions might not be malicious, so the author isn't in the wrong for ending things. So I lean towards B.\n"
