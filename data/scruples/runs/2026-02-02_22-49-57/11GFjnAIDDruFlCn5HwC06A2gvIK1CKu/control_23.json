I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author proposed on a cruise, the girlfriend said yes, but then changed her mind later that night. The author felt betrayed and broke up with her, thinking she was insensitively leading him on. The girlfriend's side is that the proposal was too public and they were moving too fast. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author planned a big public proposal, which the girlfriend wasn't consulted about. She said yes initially but then changed her mind. The author is upset because he felt she led him on. The girlfriend is upset because the proposal was public and they weren't discussing marriage yet.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. Proposing can be a big decision, and sometimes people say yes in the moment but aren't ready. The author didn't discuss engagement first, which the girlfriend pointed out. Maybe he should have had that conversation before the proposal. On the other hand, the girlfriend said yes and then retracted, which can be hurtful. \n\nBut the key point here is that the author blames her for insensitivity. However, her reaction might stem from feeling pressured or not ready. If he hadn't planned a public proposal without discussing it, maybe she would have had time to think. So perhaps the author is in the wrong for not checking in with her about the engagement plans before proposing publicly. The girlfriend's change of heart might be a result of the pressure from the situation, not insensitivity. \n\nAlso, ending the relationship immediately after such a big emotional moment could be seen as impulsive. Both parties have valid points. But the author's actions (public proposal without discussion) might have contributed to the problem. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
