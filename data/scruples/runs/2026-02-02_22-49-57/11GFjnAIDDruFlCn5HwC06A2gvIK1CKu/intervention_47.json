      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after his ex-girlfriend changed her mind after he proposed. So, the situation is that he planned a public proposal on a cruise, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He's upset and ended the relationship because she was insensitive. She, on the other hand, says it was his fault for moving too fast without discussing engagement first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author felt betrayed because she changed her mind after saying yes. He probably had big plans and got his hopes up. Public proposals can be very emotional and personal, so her backing out might have been a shock. He ended the relationship because he thought she was insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-girlfriend says that the problem was the author moving too quickly. Maybe they hadn't had the serious conversation about marriage beforehand. She might have felt pressured. Public proposals can be seen as a big step, and if they hadn't discussed marriage in a private setting first, she might have felt it was rushed. She could be feeling overwhelmed or unsure about the commitment, leading her to change her mind later.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, if they had not discussed the engagement privately before the public proposal, maybe he did move too quickly. Proposing in a public setting without having a private conversation can be seen as pressuring someone, even if the intention is romantic. The ex might have felt that she didn't have time to process her feelings properly, leading to her change of heart later. In that case, the author might share some responsibility for not having the necessary private discussion first.\n\nHowever, once she said yes and then retracted it, that's where her actions might be seen as causing emotional harm. Changing her mind after saying yes, especially in that situation, could be considered insensitive. But the root cause might be that the proposal was premature. If the author didn't check in with her about her feelings towards marriage before the proposal, he could be at fault for not ensuring her readiness.\n\nThe user's friend thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe there's a middle ground. It's a bit of a tricky situation. Both parties might have made mistakes. The author could have had a private conversation first, and she could have been more honest about her feelings at the time. But once she said yes, retracting it later without a clear reason might be hurtful. However, if she genuinely wasn't ready, maybe it's more about miscommunication. \n\nIn terms of answer, the key points are: Did the author move too fast by proposing publicly without a private discussion? If yes, then he's part of the issue. Did she not communicate her feelings properly before or after? That's also a factor. The user's friend says the author isn't wrong, but maybe the answer isn't black and white. However, based on the information given, the most balanced answer would be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but some might argue he did move too fast. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the ex says he moved too fast, but he didn't get a chance to discuss engagement first. So, maybe the answer is B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong, but there's some nuance. However, depending on cultural or personal beliefs about proposal steps, it could vary. But the main issue is her changing her mind after saying yes, which is hurtful. So the author's reaction is understandable. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
