I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy proposed during a cruise, she said yes, but then changed her mind. He ended the relationship because she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy planned a public proposal, which is a big step. The girlfriend didn't want to actually marry him after saying yes. She said it was his fault for moving too quickly without discussing engagement first. The guy feels she led him on and ended it cruelly.\n\nFrom a typical \"Am I the Asshole?\" perspective, people often look at communication and intentions. The guy didn't discuss the proposal with her beforehand, which she found problematic. She might have felt pressured, especially if they weren't fully discussing the next steps in their relationship. Public proposals can be a tradition, but maybe she wasn't on the same page. Her changing her mind might be because she wasn't ready, which isn't uncommon. However, the guy's reaction is also important\u2014ending the relationship because she changed her mind might seem harsh, but he felt hurt and she was insistent on her reasoning.\n\nThe key points are: Did he proceed without proper communication? Yes, but she also didn't express her hesitation before. Her breaking her \"yes\" might be seen as not being honest, but maybe she was truthful in that she wasn't ready. The guy's decision to end it because of her insensitivity\u2014could be justified if she was dismissive of his feelings. But then again, she had the right to change her mind if she wasn't ready.\n\nIn many advice columns, the emphasis is on communication. If he didn't check in with her about marriage before proposing, that's a misstep. However, if she truly wasn't ready, even after saying yes, it's a complex situation. The guy ending the relationship is his choice, but his anger at her insensitivity might be valid if she didn't consider his feelings.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the woman changed her mind after the proposal, which is her right, but the guy's decision to end things is his choice. However, some might argue that he should have discussed the proposal with her first. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main fault might be on her for changing her mind after yes, but it's not necessarily a wrongdoing. Alternatively, the guy's approach without discussion might be the issue. But since she changed her mind, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
