I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) for breaking up with his girlfriend after she changed her mind about accepting his proposal. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The guy proposed in a public way with a photographer and all that, and she said yes. Then later changed her mind. He was really hurt and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. She on the other hand said that he moved too fast without discussing the engagement first, and that's why she changed her mind.\n\nSo, why would he be at fault? Proposing in a public setting might be seen as pressuring her or not giving her enough time to think. Maybe he didn't consider her feelings by making it so public without discussing it privately first. She might have felt cornered or surprised, leading to her changing her mind. If he was supposed to talk about engagement plans before making a big public proposal, then maybe he messed up there.\n\nOn the other hand, after she said yes, she backs out. That's a huge emotional blow. He had every right to feel hurt. But she said she wasn't ready, which could be her issue. However, when he asked why she led him on, she blamed him for moving too fast. Maybe the problem was a combination of both not being ready for marriage and the way the proposal was handled.\n\nThe guy ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. But maybe he should have tried to talk through it instead of breaking up right away. But given the pain involved, his reaction is understandable. \n\nIn terms of AITA, it's a bit of a gray area. He might have rushed the proposal without proper discussion, but her changing her mind after accepting is also a problem. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The fact that he proposed publicly without prior discussion could be his fault, leading to her not being ready. But after she changed her mind, his decision to end the relationship is his call. \n\nSo, considering the situation, maybe the author did have some fault in how he approached the proposal, but his reaction is also a personal choice. However, the AITA often looks at who made a mistake. Since she changed her mind after saying yes, but he also forced a public proposal without discussing, it's a bit split. But maybe the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because her actions were hurtful, but he might have contributed to the situation. Hmm, but the main question is if he's in the wrong. The answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't discuss the proposal properly first. Or B (no) because she was insensitively changing her mind. \n\nIn many AITA cases, proposing publicly without prior discussion is seen as a mistake. So maybe A is the answer here. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check again. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author's actions: public proposal without discussion. Her actions: changing her mind after accepting. So, the user (author) is the one who might be at fault for not discussing engagement first. Therefore, answer A.\n"
