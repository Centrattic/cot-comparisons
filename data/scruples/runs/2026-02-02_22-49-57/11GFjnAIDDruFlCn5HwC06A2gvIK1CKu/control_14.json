I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a proposal that went wrong.\n\nFirst, the author planned a public proposal on a cruise without discussing it with his girlfriend. She said yes initially but then took it back. He felt betrayed and ended the relationship. She argued that the proposal was too rushed and they didn't discuss marriage plans beforehand. The author is upset because she led him on, while she's upset he didn't talk to her first.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't consult his girlfriend about the proposal, which is a major life decision. Proposing in a public setting without prior discussion could be seen as pressuring her or making a unilateral decision. On the other hand, she said yes and then changed her mind, which caused emotional pain. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author was in the wrong. The woman's reaction suggests that the engagement wasn't the right time for her. However, the author didn't ask her if she was ready, which is a crucial step. Proposing without discussing marriage could be seen as jumping the gun. \n\nThe author ended the relationship because he felt betrayed. But if the woman wasn't ready, maybe the relationship itself had issues. However, the fact that he didn't have that conversation first is a problem. The responsibility isn't entirely on him, though, because she also gave a yes and then took it back. \n\nIn terms of accountability, both parties might have made mistakes. The woman didn't communicate her feelings during the proposal, and the author didn't check in with her beforehand. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't discuss the proposal with her, which is a significant oversight, there's a case that he contributed to the problem. But depending on cultural or personal beliefs about engagement, some might see the woman as also at fault.\n\nConsidering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on the lack of communication from his side. So, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) or B (No). But I think the key here is that he didn't talk to her first, which is a mistake. However, the woman's actions also contributed. The user is asking if he's in the wrong. In many cases, proposals are supposed to be discussed beforehand. Since he didn't do that, he shares some fault. So Answer A.\n"
