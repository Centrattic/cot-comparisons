      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is at fault. The situation is that he proposed to his girlfriend on a cruise in a public way with a photographer, and she initially said yes. Then later, she changed her mind and didn't want to marry him. He felt broken, cried, and ended the relationship because he thought she was insensitive. She, on the other hand, felt that he moved too quickly without discussing the engagement first. \n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The author planned a public proposal without prior discussion, which the girlfriend felt was moving too fast. She said yes initially but then changed her mind. The author is upset because she led him on, while she blames him for not talking about the engagement first.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. From the author's side: he went through a lot of effort to propose, which is a significant commitment. He trusted her when she said yes and then got rejected later. That's a lot of emotional pain. He might feel that she should have been honest from the start if she wasn't ready.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective: she might have felt pressured by the public proposal without prior discussion. Maybe she wasn't emotionally ready for marriage and the sudden proposal made her realize she wasn't prepared. She could be reacting to the way the proposal was handled rather than her feelings towards him personally.\n\nNow, societal expectations come into play. Proposing is a big step, and while some people like a public proposal, others might prefer a more private conversation first. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she didn't feel comfortable with the suddenness of the proposal. The author didn't check in with her about their relationship goals before proposing, which might have contributed to her change of heart.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, maybe. By not discussing the engagement plans beforehand, he might have overlooked her feelings and readiness. Planning a public proposal without talking to her first could be seen as rushing into a commitment without mutual agreement on the next steps. His reaction of ending the relationship because of her change of heart might also be harsh, but given the emotional toll, it's understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend changed her mind after saying yes. That's a big deal too. Once someone says yes, even if they change their mind later, it's hurtful. But she might have been under pressure during the proposal and later realized she wasn't ready. \n\nI think there's some blame on both sides. The author didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, leading to the situation where she felt overwhelmed. However, she also didn't communicate her feelings about moving too fast until after the proposal. It's a mutual failure in communication. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key is whether he was at fault for not discussing the proposal first. Since proposing is a major commitment, not talking about it beforehand could be seen as a mistake. The girlfriend's reason for not wanting to marry him was that they were moving too fast, which the author could have addressed by talking to her before the proposal. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's change of heart after saying yes is also problematic. But the question is about the author. Since he didn't check in with her about engagement plans before proposing, that's a valid point against him. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. But I'm not sure. Some people might argue that the girlfriend is in the wrong for changing her mind. But given that the author didn't talk to her first, it's partially his fault.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the girlfriend is wrong for changing her mind, but the author's approach was also flawed. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might be A because he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, leading to her feeling pressured. So the answer is A.\n"
