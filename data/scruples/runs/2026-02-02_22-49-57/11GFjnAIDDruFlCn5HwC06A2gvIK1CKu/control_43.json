I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a proposal that was accepted but then retracted. \n\nFirst, the guy planned a public proposal on a cruise, set it up with a photographer, and she said yes. Then they went back to the room, and she changed her mind. He was hurt and ended the relationship because he felt she led him on. She blamed him for moving too fast and not discussing the engagement first.\n\nSo, the key points here are the public proposal without prior discussion and her changing her mind. The question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong. \n\nIn many cultures, a proposal is a big commitment, and a public proposal can be seen as a significant step. If the guy didn't discuss the engagement plans with her beforehand, maybe he did jump into it too quickly. But on the other hand, she accepted the proposal and then retracted it, which is also hurtful.\n\nHowever, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The guy didn't consider her readiness and maybe pressured her into a public commitment without talking about their future first. That might be his fault. But then again, once she said yes, retracting it is also problematic. However, the question is not about her, but the author's actions. \n\nSo, if the guy didn't communicate with her about their relationship goals before the proposal, he might be at fault for not having those conversations. His reaction to ending the relationship because of her insensitivity is another point. Maybe he had a right to be upset, but the root cause might be his approach to the proposal without discussing it first. \n\nSo, considering these points, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he didn't discuss the engagement with her beforehand, leading to the situation where she felt pressured or unprepared. Therefore, he shares some responsibility.\n"
