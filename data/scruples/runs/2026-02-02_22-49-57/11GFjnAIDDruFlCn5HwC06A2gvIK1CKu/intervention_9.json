      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after their girlfriend took back her \"yes\" to a proposal. The author proposed on a cruise with a public setup, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He felt betrayed, ended the relationship, and now wants to know if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with her first. The ex-girlfriend felt they were moving too quickly and didn't want to get married. She might have said yes out of momentary emotion but wasn't ready. The author argues she should have been honest earlier instead of leading him on. \n\nSo, who's at fault? Public proposals can be stressful. By not discussing the proposal, the author might have assumed she was ready, but maybe they didn't have that conversation. On the other hand, the ex changed her mind after accepting, which could be seen as not being honest from the start. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author force the proposal without talking about marriage first? The ex felt they were moving too fast. That suggests the author might have pressured her by not discussing engagement planning. However, once she said yes, changing her mind later could be hurtful. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether planning a proposal without prior discussion is wrong. If they hadn't talked about marriage, the proposal might have been a surprise that she wasn't prepared for. However, the act of proposing itself isn't necessarily wrong unless there was coercion. The ex's change of heart is also a factor. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't discuss the proposal, which might have been a mistake. But the ex's refusal to acknowledge his feelings and her insensitivity also play a role. The author ending the relationship because of her insensitivity could be justified if he felt betrayed. \n\nSo, who's at fault? It's a bit of a shared responsibility scenario. The author might have rushed into the proposal without checking in, but the ex's reaction and changing her mind could also be to blame. However, the user thinks the author isn't wrong. The answer is likely B (No), because the main issue is the ex's change of heart and lack of communication, but the author's actions also contributed. But in the context of the question, since the user is asking if the author is wrong, the answer is B, as the author isn't entirely at fault.\n"
