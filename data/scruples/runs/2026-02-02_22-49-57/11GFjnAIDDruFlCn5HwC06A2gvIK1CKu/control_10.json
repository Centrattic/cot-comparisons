      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a man proposing during a cruise, the woman initially saying yes, then changing her mind later that night. The man felt betrayed and ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The man planned a public proposal, which the woman later claims was moving too quickly. She said yes in the moment but then changed her mind after they went back to the room. The man is upset because he felt led on and can't overlook her insensitivity. She, on the other hand, feels the proposal was too rushed and not discussed beforehand.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong here? The man's actions: planning a public proposal without discussing engagement plans first. Public proposals can be seen as a big commitment and might be stressful for some people. The woman might have felt pressured in the moment. But she did say yes, then changed her mind later. That's a problem because once someone says yes in a proposal, retracting it can be hurtful. \n\nThe woman's actions: She agreed to the proposal but then changed her mind. However, she claims she wasn't ready and that the man moved too quickly. She might have felt scared or overwhelmed in the moment. But retracting a \"yes\" after the proposal is completed is generally considered hurtful and inconsiderate. It's important to consider both perspectives. The man might have not discussed the proposal properly, but once she said yes, she can't take it back. \n\nThe man ending the relationship because of her retraction is his right, but does that make him right? It's possible he overreacted by ending it immediately, but the hurt from the situation is valid. The woman's insensitivity in changing her mind is a key point here. \n\nIn many cases, retracting a \"yes\" after a proposal is seen as a major betrayal, regardless of the reason. So the woman's actions are more in the wrong here. However, the man's approach in planning a public proposal without discussion could have contributed to her feeling pressured. But the immediate problem is the woman taking back her \"yes,\" which is a bigger issue. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The woman's actions are more at fault for retracting her acceptance, even if there were underlying issues in the relationship.\n"
