I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong. The guy planned a big proposal on a cruise, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He's upset and broke up with her, thinking she was insensitive. She said it was his fault for moving too fast and not discussing it beforehand.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The guy put a lot of effort into the proposal, maybe even a public one, which can be stressful. He was excited and then heartbroken when she retracted her acceptance. On the other hand, she might not have been ready for marriage and felt pressured by the sudden proposal. She could have been honest earlier, but maybe he didn't give her the chance to talk about it before the proposal.\n\nHe didn't discuss engagement plans with her first. That's a big step. Maybe she wanted to take things slower, and he didn't communicate that. But she did say yes first, then changed her mind. That's confusing. Why say yes if you don't mean it? But maybe she felt pressured in the moment. However, after the proposal, she admitted she wasn't ready, so maybe she was truthful after the fact.\n\nHe ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. But breaking up over this might be extreme. However, trust could be broken if she didn't mean the yes. Or maybe the problem is that he didn't check if she was ready first. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he didn't talk to her about marriage before the proposal, that's on him. Proposing without discussing it could have been a mistake. But she also had the chance to say no when he asked. \n\nSo, who's at fault? If he didn't check in with her about marriage plans first, he made a mistake. But she changed her mind after saying yes, which is hurtful. Both might have contributed. However, the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIf the answer is A (yes), then the author is wrong for not discussing it first. If B (no), then she's wrong for retracting the yes. It's a tough call. The article often says that public proposals can be stressful, and not discussing is a factor. So maybe the author is partially at fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Depending on the perspective, maybe both did something wrong. However, the question is specifically about the author. \n\nThe answer might be B (no), but I'm not entirely sure. Need to weigh the factors again. The author didn't discuss it first, leading to the problem. But the ex changed her mind after accepting. So both have faults. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the main issue is that he didn't talk beforehand, then he's partially responsible. But if the main issue is her retracting the yes, then she's more to blame. \n\nIn many similar situations, the person who didn't discuss the big step is often seen as contributing. So maybe the answer is A (author is wrong). But some might argue that she's wrong for the retraction. So it's a bit ambiguous. The user's initial thought is that the author isn't wrong, but maybe they're both partially wrong. However, the options are only A or B. The user is asking for a choice between the two. \n\nGiven that the author didn't discuss the proposal plan with her first, leading to her feeling pressured, he's in the wrong. Therefore, answer A. But if the main issue is her retracting the yes, then answer B. Hmm. I think in this case, the key point is that he didn't talk to her about marriage first. So he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
