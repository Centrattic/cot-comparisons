      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong. The author set up a public proposal during a cruise, the girlfriend said \"yes\" but then later changed her mind. The author felt hurt and ended the relationship, and now he's asking if he's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author went through the effort of planning a public proposal, which is a significant commitment. The girlfriend initially said yes but then changed her mind. The author felt that she led him on, while the girl said it was his fault for not discussing the engagement first and moving too quickly.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, he planned a proposal, which is a big step. He might have felt that since she said yes, it was a commitment. But the girlfriend's response suggests she wasn't ready for marriage, and she believes the proposal was premature. The author is upset because she didn't communicate her feelings beforehand, leading to his emotional hurt. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have felt pressured by the public proposal. Maybe she didn't realize that saying yes in that moment was a commitment, or perhaps she wasn't ready for marriage and the proposal made her realize that. The key point here is communication. The author didn't discuss the idea of getting engaged with her first, leading to her surprise and later refusal. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. Proposing, especially in a public setting, is a big step. If the author didn't have prior conversations about marriage, the girlfriend might not have been prepared for the proposal. The girl's reaction of saying yes and then changing her mind could indicate that she didn't fully process the implications at the moment. \n\nThe author's decision to end the relationship is a result of feeling that she was insensitive. However, her side is that the proposal was too sudden. It's possible that both had different expectations. The author might have assumed that saying yes was a commitment, but the girl might have seen it as a spontaneous moment without full consideration. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a gray area. The author could have discussed the proposal with her first to ensure she was ready. The girl, on the other hand, could have been more open about her feelings before the proposal. But since the proposal was already done, and she changed her mind, the author is hurt because he acted on her initial \"yes\" and then faced rejection. \n\nFrom a general perspective, proposing without prior discussion is a risk. The girl might have been under pressure to say yes in the moment, leading to her later regret. The author's reaction is understandable, but maybe he could have handled it without ending the relationship. However, the situation is complex, and both sides have valid points. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Considering the details, the answer might be B (No). The author isn't entirely wrong because the girlfriend's actions did cause hurt, but the author could have communicated better. However, the main fault lies with the girlfriend for leading him on after saying yes. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the user's initial thought is that he isn't, I might lean towards B. But I need to make sure.\n"
