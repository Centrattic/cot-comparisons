      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author proposed to his girlfriend on a cruise in a public way with a photographer, and she said yes, but later changed her mind. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The proposal was a big, public event. The author was excited and set it up with a photographer, which might imply he wanted to make it a memorable and official moment. The girlfriend said yes initially but then backed out. The author is upset she didn't actually want to go through with the marriage, and she blamed him for moving too quickly without discussing it first. The author feels she led him on and says he ended the relationship due to her insensitivity.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case. The possible answers are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author did plan a surprise proposal without prior discussion. Even though he was excited, maybe he should have talked to her about marriage first to ensure they were on the same page. Proposing in a public setting might have been overwhelming for her if she wasn't ready. Her response of backing out could be due to feeling pressured or not having the chance to process the decision calmly. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was acting on her initial \"yes,\" which is a standard response when someone is asked to marry. If she changed her mind after that, it's a significant betrayal. The author's feelings of being led on are valid because once she said yes, he had every right to believe she was committed. Her insensitivity might lie in not being honest from the start, but the author could also be at fault for not having that conversation beforehand. \n\nThe question is whether either party is wrong. The girlfriend's argument is that the author moved too fast without discussing engagement, which could be a legitimate point. If they hadn't had the conversation about marriage yet, the surprise might have been too abrupt for her. However, once the proposal happened and she accepted, retracting it is problematic. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have been overly eager and didn't check in with her about big life steps. But once she said yes, regardless of her initial hesitation, she should have been honest about her feelings. Ending the relationship because of her change of heart might be a reaction to the hurt, but it's also possible the author is in the wrong for not having that conversation first. \n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend's insensitivity is in changing her mind after accepting. The author's breakup reason is based on her insensitivity, which could be justified. But the root cause might be the lack of communication from both sides. \n\nSo, the answer is probably not a clear A or B. However, given the options, the user is looking for a choice. The key is whether the author's actions (proposing without discussion) are to blame. If the proposal was a surprise without prior talk, maybe that's where he went wrong. But if the problem is her retracting after accepting, then he's not wrong. \n\nI think the main issue is the surprise proposal without prior discussion. The girlfriend's argument about moving too fast is valid. So the author might be in the wrong for that. However, her retracting the acceptance is also a major problem. But the question is whether he is in the wrong. If the problem was that he didn't communicate before the proposal, then A is the answer. But if the problem is her insensitivity, then B. \n\nIn many relationship advice contexts, big decisions like marriage should be discussed before a proposal. A surprise might be sweet, but if the partner isn't ready, it can be stressful. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt pressured. The author didn't consider that she needed to talk about marriage first. So in that sense, he might be at fault. Therefore, the answer could be A. But I'm a bit conflicted because she retracted her acceptance, which is also wrong. \n\nBut the question is specifically about who is in the wrong. The author is asking if he is in the wrong. If he didn't discuss the engagement first, then maybe he is. But if the main issue is her changing her mind, then he isn't. Since the girlfriend's side is presented as moving too fast, maybe the author did make a mistake. However, the user's initial thought is that the author isn't wrong. \n\nI need to weigh both aspects. If the answer hinges on whether the author should have had that conversation first, then A. If the answer is about her retracting her acceptance, then B. In this case, the girlfriend said that the author's fault was moving too quickly. So maybe the author did move too quickly without communication, making him partially at fault. But the user says they think the author isn't wrong. \n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend's insensitivity is in her change of heart after accepting, so the author is right to breakup. But the initial proposal without prior discussion might be his fault. The answer isn't straightforward. However, in similar AITA stories, the person who made the proposal without talking is often seen as at least partially responsible. So maybe the answer is A. But I'm not 100% sure. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions (changing her mind) are clearly problematic, but the author's actions (proposing without prior discussion) might also be an issue. In the AITA context, sometimes the focus is on who made the bigger mistake. The girlfriend's insensitivity is a major issue, but the author's lack of communication is also a factor. Depending on the interpretation, maybe both are at fault. But since the options are A or B, I have to choose. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't wrong. But in the situation, the girlfriend's hesitation wasn't addressed before the proposal. The author might have been in the wrong for not ensuring they were both on the same page before proposing. So the answer would be A. But I need to make sure. \n\nHmm. Let me check similar cases. In many AITA scenarios where someone proposes without discussing marriage, the person proposing is often seen as having made a mistake. However, the girlfriend's retraction is also a major issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIf the author is asking if he's in the wrong for ending the relationship due to her insensitivity, but if he didn't communicate first, maybe he's not wrong. But if the problem was not discussing the engagement first, then he's in the wrong. \n\nThe answer is likely A because he didn't talk about the engagement before proposing, which led to her feeling unprepared. But the user thinks he's not wrong. However, in AITA, the focus is on who is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's main point is that the proposal was done without discussion, then the author is at fault. So the answer is A.\n"
