      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a proposal gone wrong. The author proposed on a cruise, got a yes, but then the girlfriend (now ex) changed her mind. The author is upset and ended the relationship, thinking it was the woman's fault for leading him on.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author set up a public proposal with a photographer, which the girlfriend didn't expect. She said yes initially but later changed her mind. The author feels betrayed and ended the relationship. The girlfriend argues that the public proposal was a problem because they hadn't discussed engagement plans yet and that they were moving too fast.\n\nSo, looking at both sides. The author's action was to propose in a public, planned way without discussing it first. That might come off as abrupt or not considering her readiness. On the other hand, the girlfriend changed her mind after agreeing, which can be hurtful. The author ended the relationship due to feeling led on and insensitivity from her.\n\nNow, considering who's at fault. The woman might have felt pressured by the public proposal, which could explain her hesitation. However, once she said yes, retracting it later without a valid reason (like safety or health concerns) could be seen as emotionally damaging. The author felt betrayed and ended things, which is a valid reaction to being misled, even if the proposal wasn't discussed beforehand.\n\nBut was the author in the wrong by not discussing the proposal first? Proposals are a big step, and it's important to have those conversations. Planning a public proposal without knowing her stance on marriage could be seen as not respecting her autonomy. However, the immediate rejection after a \"yes\" complicates things. The woman's refusal to acknowledge his feelings might also be a factor.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might have contributed. The author didn't check if she was ready, and she changed her mind after accepting. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the woman changed her mind without a valid reason, maybe she's more at fault. However, the way the author proceeded with the proposal could have been insensitive. The user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a bit nuanced.\n\nI think it's a tricky situation. The woman's actions directly caused emotional harm by retracting her acceptance, but the author's approach might have contributed to her not being ready. However, the immediate aftermath is that she broke her word, which is more directly the issue here. So the author might not be in the wrong for ending the relationship due to her insensitivity, as per his perspective.\n"
