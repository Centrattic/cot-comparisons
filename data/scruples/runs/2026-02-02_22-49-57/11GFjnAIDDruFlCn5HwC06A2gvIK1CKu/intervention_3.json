      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author proposed to his girlfriend during a cruise with a planned, public proposal. She said yes, but then changed her mind, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The author felt betrayed because the woman initially said yes but then didn't follow through. He ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her \"insensitivity.\" The woman, on the other hand, felt that the proposal was rushed and not discussed beforehand. She might have felt pressured or that the engagement was moving too fast for her comfort.\n\nFrom the author's side, planning a public proposal without prior discussion could be seen as a lack of communication. Marriage is a big step, and assuming the other person is ready without checking in could be a misstep. However, the author was genuinely excited and believed she was on board when she said yes. The fact that she changed her mind after the proposal might indicate she wasn't fully committed at the time.\n\nOn the woman's side, she might have felt pressured by the public proposal setup. It's possible she wanted to say yes in the moment but realized later she wasn't ready. Her response of blaming the proposal method for moving too quickly might show she felt the approach was a problem. But her not communicating her true feelings beforehand is a valid point from the author's perspective.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are communication and mutual readiness. The author didn't discuss the proposal plan with her beforehand, which could have set up her surprise and subsequent change of heart. However, after the initial \"yes,\" her backing out might be seen as insensitivity, but it's also possible she was overwhelmed.\n\nIn relationships, both parties need to communicate their expectations. The author's mistake could be not discussing engagement plans, which might have led to her feeling caught off guard. However, her reaction and later change of heart might also be a problem. The author ending the relationship because of her insensitivity is his choice, but whether he's wrong for that depends on the situation's nuances.\n\nConsidering all this, I think both sides have some responsibility. The author may have rushed into the proposal without proper communication, and the woman might have been unclear about her readiness. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't force her to say yes and she changed her mind after agreeing, the main issue is the lack of prior discussion. But the story is from his perspective, emphasizing her insensitivity. In typical \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenarios, both parties often have some fault, but the answer here might lean towards the author not being wrong because the woman's actions were inconsistent, even if partly due to his approach. So, the answer is B.\n"
