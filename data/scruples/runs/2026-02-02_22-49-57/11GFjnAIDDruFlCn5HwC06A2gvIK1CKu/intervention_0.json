I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a proposal gone wrong. The man planned a big public proposal during a cruise with a photographer, and the woman said yes but then changed her mind. He feels hurt and ends the relationship, while she blames him for moving too fast and not discussing the engagement first.\n\nFirst, I need to break down both sides. The man did plan a proposal without discussing it with her first. While proposing is a big step, maybe he assumed she was ready without having that conversation. On the other hand, the woman initially said yes but then backed out, which is confusing and hurtful. She also didn't communicate her feelings about wanting to slow down before the proposal.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The man's approach was a bit impulsive\u2014planning a public proposal without checking in with her about their future. That could be seen as not respecting her readiness. However, the woman's reaction after saying yes is also problematic. She didn't clarify her feelings during the engagement, which might have been the time to address it. Now, after saying yes, she's backing out, which is a major letdown for him.\n\nIs the man in the wrong? He didn't discuss the proposal, but proposing is a personal decision. However, not discussing the engagement process itself might have been an oversight. The woman's change of heart after an initial \"yes\" is also a significant issue. Both have some accountability here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. His hurt is valid. However, maybe he could have handled it differently. But since he's the one asking if he's in the wrong, perhaps the answer lies in whether his actions (ending the relationship) were justified. Given her actions, maybe it's not his fault. But the initial proposal might have contributed to the problem. So, maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, but it's a close call.\n"
