I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy proposed during a cruise, she said yes, they celebrated, and then later she changed her mind. He felt heartbroken, ended the relationship, and is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy planned a public proposal without discussing it with her first. Maybe she felt pressured? She said it was his fault for moving too fast. On the other hand, she said yes and then took it back, which is really hurtful and confusing. \n\nPublic proposals can be traditional, but they can also be overwhelming if one person isn't ready. He didn't talk to her about the proposal beforehand, so maybe he assumed she was ready. But once she said yes and then changed her mind, that's a big deal. She didn't follow through, which is really painful for him. \n\nHe broke up with her because of her insensitivity. But is it her fault entirely? She might have been scared or not ready, but breaking trust like that is tough. The guy didn't check if she was ready for a commitment. Maybe they both have some responsibility here. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he didn't discuss the proposal with her first, maybe that's a mistake. But the bigger issue is her taking back her acceptance. So maybe both are at fault, but the question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the key point is that he didn't talk to her about the proposal first. If he had discussed it, maybe she would have said she wasn't ready. But since she said yes and then changed her mind after the proposal, that's on her. However, the fact that he didn't check in with her before proposing might make him partially at fault. \n\nBut the main issue here is the engagement being retracted. That's a huge betrayal of trust. So even though he didn't ask her if she was ready for marriage beforehand, the fact that she led him on after saying yes is worse. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
