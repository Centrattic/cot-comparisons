She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he proposed on a cruise with a big setup, and she said yes, but then later changed her mind. He was really upset and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on. She said it was his fault for not discussing engagement first and moving too quickly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with her beforehand. That might have been a mistake. Proposing can be a big step, and if one person isn't ready, it can cause problems. She might have felt pressured or overwhelmed by the sudden proposal. She mentioned they were moving too quickly, so maybe they hadn't had the talk about marriage yet, which is important.\n\nOn the other hand, she initially said yes, then changed her mind. That's a big deal. When someone says yes to a proposal, it's a commitment. Changing your mind after that could be hurtful, even if there's a reason. The author felt led on, which is understandable. But she might have realized she wasn't ready after the proposal, which is a different scenario. People do change their minds, but it's definitely not easy to deal with.\n\nThe author ended the relationship because of the insensitivity. Is that justified? If she changed her mind, maybe they could have talked it through. But she didn't listen to his perspective and blamed him for moving too fast. That could be part of the problem. Communication is key here. Both sides might have missteps. He didn't check in with her about marriage before proposing, and she didn't handle the change of heart well.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he didn't communicate his intentions and she didn't consider the pressure of a public proposal, maybe they both share some responsibility. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. He proposed without discussing it first, which could be a mistake. However, she changed her mind after saying yes, which is hurtful. It's a tough call. Some might say he should have had that conversation before the proposal, making him partially responsible. Others might think she was insensitive to change her mind. But since he ended the relationship because he felt she was wrong for not being upfront and moving too fast, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. I'm leaning towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the proposal was done without prior discussion, but the main issue is her changing her mind and how she handled it. However, there's room for both sides to have flaws. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Maybe he isn't because proposing is a big step, but he should have checked in first. But the answer might depend on cultural norms and expectations. In some views, the proposal should be discussed beforehand. In others, a surprise proposal is okay. Since she changed her mind after the proposal, maybe he's not wrong to end the relationship. So B.\n"
