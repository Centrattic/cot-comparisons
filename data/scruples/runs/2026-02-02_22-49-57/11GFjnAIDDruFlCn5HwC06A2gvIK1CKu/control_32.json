      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after his girlfriend changed her mind about accepting his proposal during a cruise. They went on a cruise, he planned a public proposal with a photographer, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The author set up a big, public proposal. She initially said yes but then retracted it. He felt hurt and ended the relationship. She blamed him for moving too fast and not discussing engagement first.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is wrong. Proposing is a major commitment, and doing it publicly might add pressure. The girlfriend might have felt overwhelmed by the sudden proposal without prior discussion. The author didn't talk about marriage plans first, which could have led to her not being ready. However, once she said yes, retracting it caused emotional pain. But her reasoning is that the proposal was too rushed. \n\nThe author's reaction is understandable\u2014he was hurt and felt led on. But maybe he should have discussed marriage plans before proposing. However, the act of retracting a yes after the proposal is also hurtful. The girlfriend might have been honest in the moment but changed her mind later. The author ending the relationship because of her insensitivity is his choice, but whether he's wrong depends on context. \n\nIn many cases, engagement is a mutual decision. If she was unsure and the proposal was sudden, the author might have acted too quickly. But once she committed, retracting it is also problematic. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't force the proposal on her and she changed her mind later, maybe he's not wrong. The answer might lean towards B (No) because both parties have valid points, but she was the one who changed her mind after accepting. Alternatively, if the author should have discussed the proposal first, maybe A. But given that she retracted her acceptance, the author's anger is justified. So likely B.\n"
