I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after their girlfriend took back her \"yes\" to his proposal.\n\nFirst, the author planned a public proposal on a cruise. He set up a photographer and everything. She said yes, but later changed her mind. He felt crushed and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitve for leading him on. She, on the other hand, thought he moved too fast without discussing the engagement first. She felt pressured and wasn't ready.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author might argue that after she said yes, retracting it was a betrayal. But the girlfriend might say that the public proposal pressured her into an immediate answer without proper discussion. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he proposed suddenly without prior conversations about marriage, maybe he didn't give her time to think. But after she accepted, going back on it could be seen as breaking trust. However, maybe she realized she wasn't ready, which happens. \n\nThe author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, but maybe he could have handled it differently. His reaction is valid if he felt hurt, but could he have given her a chance to explain further? However, her changing her mind after a yes is hurtful and might justify his decision. \n\nLegally or socially, retracting a proposal isn't a crime, but emotionally, it's a big deal. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling betrayed, but perhaps the situation is more nuanced. His actions, ending the relationship, might be seen as a response to her change of heart, which is understandable.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but there's some nuance. However, since the user asked for a strict A or B, and the author's actions were a response to her insensitivity, B seems correct.\n"
