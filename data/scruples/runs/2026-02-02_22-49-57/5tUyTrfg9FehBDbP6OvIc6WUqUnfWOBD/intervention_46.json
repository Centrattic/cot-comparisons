I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister had a bad experience with an ex-boyfriend who was abusive and controlled her. The author thinks maybe the sister isn't being entirely honest about how much agency she had in that situation. The parents didn't know, but the author went to the current boyfriend and told him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the author out. The sister then cut ties, saying the author can't be in her life.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know the opinion here. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nHmm. On one hand, sharing personal information without consent can be a breach of privacy. The sister might have kept her past a secret for a reason, maybe to protect herself or start fresh. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being misled, but did they have the right to do that? Also, the author's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so maybe the author thought it was necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction suggests he felt violated. If the sister had shared that history herself, it would be her responsibility. The author stepping in might have been overstepping, even with good intentions. The sister's response indicates she was hurt by the breach of trust, which could mean the author crossed a boundary.\n\nBut the sister was in a serious relationship, and the author might have thought the boyfriend deserved to know. However, the sister's agency in the situation is a factor. If the author doubts the sister's version of events, maybe they should have talked to her first instead of going to the boyfriend. The author's approach might have been confrontational without giving the sister a chance to address it herself.\n\nSo, considering the dynamics, the author's actions might be seen as well-meaning but inappropriate. The sister's right to privacy and autonomy is important. The author didn't consult the sister first, which could be the main issue here. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's boundaries and privacy, even if the intention was to help.\n"
