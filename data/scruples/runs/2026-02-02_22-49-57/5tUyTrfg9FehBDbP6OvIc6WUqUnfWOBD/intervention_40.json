I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out. The author believes the sister might not be telling the whole truth about her agency in that situation. The parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware of this past. The author, thinking it's wrong to hide such a major issue, decides to tell the boyfriend directly. The boyfriend reacts angrily, and the sister then cuts off the author.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's intent and the consequences. The author's intention was to protect their sister from a potential bad relationship by being honest. But did they overstep by revealing the information without the sister's consent? \n\nOn one hand, the sister might feel violated that her private information was shared without her permission. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to being surprised or maybe even justified if he felt the sister was hiding something. But if the author's concern was genuine, maybe they thought they were helping.\n\nBut wait, the author isn't the one in the relationship, so maybe they don't have the right to disclose such sensitive information. The sister might have chosen not to tell her boyfriend for a reason, or maybe she's still healing and wasn't ready. The author's action might have broken trust between siblings and caused unnecessary conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the situation involves potential abuse. If the boyfriend was unaware of the sister's past, maybe he's in denial, and the author's disclosure was necessary for his awareness. But the method of disclosure\u2014confronting him directly and causing a confrontation\u2014could be problematic. The author didn't take into account the sister's wishes or the dynamics of her relationship.\n\nThe sister's response was to cut off the author, which shows that the author's actions had serious consequences. The boyfriend's anger might be a reaction to the way the information was presented rather than the content itself. The author might have assumed the role of mediator without considering the sister's autonomy.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to help, but the action of sharing private information without consent might be seen as overstepping. Even if the topic is sensitive, the method and context matter. The author's responsibility is to respect the sister's privacy unless there's a clear danger that requires intervention, which isn't specified here. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for breaching confidentiality, even with good intentions.\n"
