I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling the sister's boyfriend about the sister's past being abused and possibly being a pimp's victim. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship, and the author thought it was wrong that she didn't tell her current partner. The author then went to the boyfriend and told him, which led to a bad reaction where the boyfriend yelled and threw them out. The sister then cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend by informing him of the sister's past. However, the sister had been concealing this information, which the author believed was a major red flag. The key points here are the right to privacy, the sister's autonomy, and the potential harm caused by the author's actions.\n\nThe author might argue that the boyfriend has a right to know about his partner's past, especially if it's something as serious as abuse. However, the sister might feel that her past is her own to disclose and that the author overstepped by revealing it without her consent. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to the sudden revelation and the way it was told to him, which might have been unkind or without context.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could be seen as violating the sister's privacy. Even if the author's intentions were good, the method of disclosure might have been inappropriate. The sister might have wanted to handle the situation herself if she chose to disclose it. The author's actions led to a breakdown in relationships with both the sister and the boyfriend, which is a significant consequence.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author had the right to judge the sister's partner choice. The sister is an adult, and unless there was an immediate danger (like the boyfriend potentially harming her), it's typically up to her to decide whom to date. The author's interference might be seen as overreaching, even if the author believed they were helping.\n\nI should also consider cultural or familial norms. In some families, intervening in siblings' relationships is common, while in others, it's seen as meddlesome. The sister's reaction suggests she felt her boundaries were crossed, which is a strong indicator that the author's actions were unwelcome.\n\nAdditionally, the author's initial comment to the parents about the boyfriend being good for knowing the sister's history might have been the catalyst. The parents' doubt about the boyfriend's knowledge could have influenced the author's decision to act. However, the author's decision to confront the boyfriend directly without discussing it with the sister first might have been the key misstep.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might have been to protect the boyfriend, the method of disclosure without the sister's consent and the resulting harm to relationships suggest that the author overstepped their bounds. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
