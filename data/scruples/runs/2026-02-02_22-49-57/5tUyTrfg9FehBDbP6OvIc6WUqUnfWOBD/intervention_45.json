I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. Let me consider the key points.\n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship, which is a serious matter. The writer was concerned that the boyfriend didn't know about this past, which could affect their relationship. The parents were also unsure if he knew. The writer's intention was to inform the boyfriend so he could make an informed decision.\n\nBut wait, the writer went directly to the boyfriend and told him without consulting the sister first. That's a big point. The sister hadn't disclosed this to her boyfriend, and the writer decided to do it on her behalf. Even if the writer's intention was to protect the boyfriend, bypassing the sister's agency is a problem. The sister might have wanted to handle it herself, especially since she was in a serious relationship. \n\nAlso, the sister's reaction was cutting off the writer. That shows how hurt she felt, maybe feeling betrayed. The writer might have overstepped by not talking to the sister first. Ethically, respecting someone's autonomy to share their own story is important. Even if the writer doubted the sister's account, the right approach might have been to talk to the sister and encourage her to disclose it, rather than doing it for her.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was defensive, which could be because he was surprised, but it's not the writer's fault. However, the method of disclosure was problematic. The writer didn't consider the sister's wishes or give her a chance to handle it herself. So while the intention might have been good, the action was crossing a boundary. Therefore, the writer is in the wrong.\n"
