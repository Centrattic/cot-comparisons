I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. The situation involves the sister's history of being in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out. The author, concerned about the sister's well-being and possibly skeptical of her claims about her agency, decided to inform the boyfriend. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister's autonomy is a big factor. The author's intention was to protect the sister and the boyfriend by being honest, but did they overstep? The sister had not shared this information with her boyfriend, which is her choice unless there's an obligation to do so. The author might believe they're acting in her best interest, but sharing someone's personal trauma without their consent could be seen as violating their privacy. However, if the sister had not disclosed the abuse and the author is concerned about her being in a relationship with someone unaware of that history, maybe there's a different angle.\n\nThen, the boyfriend's reaction is a key point. If he was unaware, the author's action might have been a breach of trust between the couple. But if he was in denial or in denial about the sister's past, maybe the author did a necessary thing. However, the method of disclosure is important. Approaching the boyfriend directly without the sister's consent could be problematic. The author might have assumed they knew their intentions were good, but the sister's response cutting off the author suggests that she felt betrayed, which adds to the complexity.\n\nLegal aspects aren't the focus here, but ethically, the author's action is about respecting the sister's autonomy. The sister might have chosen not to disclose her past for her own reasons, and the author's intervention might have undermined that choice. On the other hand, if the sister had issues with agency during the abuse, maybe the author's concern is valid, but the way it was handled could have been better. The author could have spoken to the sister first to understand her perspective before involving the boyfriend.\n\nThe boyfriend's yelling and the sister cutting off the author might indicate that the author's approach was harsh or ill-timed. The question is whether the author had the right to intervene in the couple's relationship without the sister's consent. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions were justified in protecting the sister's well-being versus respecting her autonomy. Since the sister is an adult and capable of making her own decisions, the author might have overstepped by acting without her approval. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they violated the sister's privacy and possibly damaged her relationship without her consent.\n"
