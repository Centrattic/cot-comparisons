I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling the sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. First, I need to consider the context. The sister was abused by a previous partner and is now in a serious relationship. The author thought it was important for the boyfriend to know this history, maybe because they believed he wasn't aware. \n\nThe author's parents weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, so the author took it upon themselves to inform him. But the boyfriend reacted angrily, which upset the sister. Now the sister is cutting off the author.\n\nI should think about boundaries here. The author is a sibling, but they might not have the right to share such personal information without the sister's consent. Even if the author had good intentions, disclosing someone's private trauma without their permission can be a breach of trust. The sister might feel that her privacy was violated, especially if she didn't want the boyfriend to know. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is in the right. The key issue is whether the author had the authority to share that information. Even if the author thought it was for her own good, it's usually up to the person to decide who knows about their past. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for overstepping and not respecting their sister's autonomy regarding her personal history. The fact that the sister is now cutting them off suggests that the action was a significant breach. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
