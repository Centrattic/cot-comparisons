I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past, which the boyfriend might not have known. The sister had a history of being abused by an ex who was basically her pimp. The author's parents mentioned they weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, so the author decided to tell him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intent. They thought it was wrong for the sister to not disclose such a major part of her history to the boyfriend. The author might have been trying to protect the boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone who has a traumatic past that could affect their marriage plans. However, the sister's right to privacy and autonomy is also a factor here. The author might have overstepped by sharing personal information without the sister's consent.\n\nThe sister's history is sensitive, and whether the boyfriend already knew isn't clear. The author's parents were unsure, so maybe the sister had chosen not to share that information. By revealing it, the author could have violated the sister's trust. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from being blindsided, but the author's action was a breach of privacy regardless. The sister's response to cut off the author is harsh, but it's her choice if she feels her privacy was invaded. \n\nThe key issue is whether the author had the right to disclose such personal information. Even with good intentions, sharing someone else's private history without their permission is generally considered a breach of trust. The author might not have considered the sister's perspective and her autonomy in deciding what to share about her past. Therefore, the author's actions were inappropriate, making them at fault.\n"
