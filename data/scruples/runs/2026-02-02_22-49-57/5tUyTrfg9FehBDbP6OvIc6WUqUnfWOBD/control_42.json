I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being abused by her ex, which he was a pimp for a few months. The author thought it was wrong that the sister didn't tell her current boyfriend about this. The parents also weren't sure if he knew. The author went to the boyfriend, told him, and he reacted angrily, leading to the sister cutting off the author.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about whether the author had the right to disclose confidential information about their sister. The sister might have chosen not to share her past with her boyfriend, and the author decided to do it instead. That's a breach of privacy. Even if the author's intention was to protect the boyfriend, they didn't have the sister's permission to share that information.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the sister's safety. If the boyfriend didn't know about the abuse, maybe he's unaware of potential triggers or the sister's history. However, it's the sister's personal information to share, not the author's to disclose. The author might have thought they were helping, but privacy is a big thing here.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which could mean he was upset either because he didn't know or because he felt betrayed. The author didn't consider if revealing the information without consent could cause more harm. The sister then cut off the author, which shows the impact of the action.\n\nSo, legally and ethically, sharing someone else's private information without their consent is generally wrong unless there's an immediate danger. Since there's no mention of imminent harm, the author overstepped by not respecting the sister's choice to keep her past private. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
