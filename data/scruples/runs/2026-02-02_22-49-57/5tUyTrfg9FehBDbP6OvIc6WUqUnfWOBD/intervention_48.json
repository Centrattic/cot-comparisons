I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author's sister was in an abusive relationship with someone who was like a pimp. She's now with a new boyfriend, and the author thinks it's important that he knows about her past. The parents didn't know if the new boyfriend was aware, so the author went to tell him directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author might feel they're protecting their sister by ensuring her partner is aware of her history. But is it their place to disclose that information? The sister might have chosen to keep it private, maybe for her own reasons. The author's intention was to be honest, but did they overstep?\n\nThere's a balance between honesty and respecting someone's privacy. The sister might have her reasons for not telling her boyfriend, maybe she's working through it or didn't want to burden him. By the author revealing it, they might have violated the sister's trust. The boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but maybe that's because of the way it was told or the fact that it was a personal matter.\n\nAlso, the author's approach\u2014going directly to the boyfriend without discussing it with the sister first\u2014could be problematic. Maybe the author should have talked to the sister first to understand her perspective and whether she wanted the information shared. By not doing that, the author might have acted unilaterally, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the author's intention might have been good, but the method could be questionable. The sister's autonomy in deciding what to share about her past should be respected. The author might have crossed a line by disclosing sensitive information without the sister's consent, even if it was with good intentions. That could be why the boyfriend reacted negatively and the sister distanced herself. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the sister's privacy and agency in the situation.\n"
