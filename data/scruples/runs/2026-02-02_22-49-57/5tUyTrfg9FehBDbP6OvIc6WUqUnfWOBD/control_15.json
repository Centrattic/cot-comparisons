I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their sister's boyfriend. The sister has a history of being in an abusive relationship, where she was essentially pimped by her ex. The author told the boyfriend about this, thinking it was important for him to know since they're serious and talking marriage. The boyfriend got angry and threw them out, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's intention was to protect their sister's boyfriend from being unaware of her past. However, there's a question of whether they had the right to share that information without the sister's consent. Even if the author feels the sister might be hiding the truth, revealing someone's private information without their permission can be seen as a breach of trust. The sister might have chosen not to disclose that part of her history for various reasons, maybe to move on, protect her privacy, or due to personal healing. \n\nThe author's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so the author took it upon themselves to inform him. But is that their place to do? The sister is an adult, and her relationship choices aren't the author's responsibility unless there's a direct threat or harm. The author's action might have been well-meaning but crossed a boundary. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, while harsh, could be a result of the suddenness of the revelation and not knowing how to process it. The author then demanded an apology from the boyfriend, leading to the sister cutting them off. This suggests that the sister felt betrayed by her sibling for exposing her past, which could be why she's upset. \n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend was in a position where knowing his partner's history was crucial for their relationship, maybe the author had a point in wanting him to know. But the method of disclosure was without consent, which is problematic. \n\nSo, the key points are: 1) Did the author have the right to share the sister's private information? 2) Was the sister's decision to not disclose her history her own to make? 3) Did the author overstep, even if with good intentions?\n\nIn ethics, breaching someone's confidentiality, even if the intent is to help, can be considered wrong because it undermines trust and autonomy. The author's action might have been a violation of the sister's privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they disclosed private information without consent, leading to conflict and harm in the sister's relationships.\n"
