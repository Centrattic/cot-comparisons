I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her sister's boyfriend about her sister's past abusive relationship. \n\nFirst, the sister was in an abusive situation where her ex was like a pimp. The author thinks it's wrong that the current boyfriend doesn't know about this. The author told the boyfriend, and he got angry and reacted badly. Now the sister is cutting off the author.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author's intention was to be honest because she believes the boyfriend has a right to know. The sister had a history of being abused, and the author is concerned about her well-being. However, the sister might have chosen to keep that information private. Did the author overstep by not going through the sister or the boyfriend directly?\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction could be because he didn't know and was upset, or maybe he was aggressive. But the author didn't check with the sister first, which might have been important. The sister might feel betrayed because her personal information was shared without her consent. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between honesty and respecting privacy. The author's concern is valid, but the method of disclosure might be problematic. The sister's autonomy to decide what to share about her past is important. The author could have approached the sister first, expressed concerns, and let her decide whether to tell the boyfriend. By going directly to the boyfriend, the author may have violated the sister's trust, leading to the fallout.\n\nSo, while the intention was to protect her sister's partner from potential harm, the approach could be seen as wrong because it wasn't the sister's choice to make. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her sister's boundaries.\n"
