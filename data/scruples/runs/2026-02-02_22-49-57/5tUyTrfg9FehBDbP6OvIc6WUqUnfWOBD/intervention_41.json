I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abusive relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The sister was in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out, and the author thinks she's not being honest with her current boyfriend. The parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware, so the author decided to tell him. The boyfriend reacted negatively, and then the sister cut off the author.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the sister's past abuse, the author's concern about her not being honest, and the consequences of the author's actions.\n\nI remember that in cases like this, privacy is a big issue. The sister might not have wanted her past to be shared, especially with someone she's in a serious relationship with. The author might have thought they were protecting their sister by being honest, but maybe they overstepped by disclosing it without the sister's consent. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's previous experience was serious, and the author felt that the boyfriend had a right to know. However, the author should have considered the sister's wishes and perhaps discussed it with her first instead of going directly to her boyfriend. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was extreme, but maybe he felt blindsided or that his trust was betrayed. The sister cutting off the author is a strong reaction, which could indicate that she felt her privacy was violated. \n\nLegally and ethically, sharing someone's private information without their consent can be problematic, even with good intentions. The author's intention might have been to protect the boyfriend, but the method was without the sister's approval. \n\nSo, while the author had concerns, they might have acted without considering the sister's autonomy in deciding how and when to share her history. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not respecting the sister's privacy and boundaries.\n"
