I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her history of abuse. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex-boyfriend was basically her pimp. She's been with the new guy for over a year, and they're talking about marriage. The author tells a parent that it's good of the new boyfriend to be with her, considering her history. The parents then doubt whether the boyfriend knows about the abuse. The author feels it's wrong for the sister to hide such a major part of her past from the new partner, so they go to the boyfriend's apartment and tell him directly. The boyfriend reacts angrily, yells, and throws the author out. The sister then cuts the author off, saying they can \"fuck off\" if the author wants an apology.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the author's right to disclose their sister's private information and the appropriateness of their actions. The author's intention was to be honest and ensure the boyfriend was fully informed, which is understandable given the seriousness of the situation. But did they overstep by not getting the sister's consent?\n\nIn most ethical guidelines, sharing someone else's private information without their permission can be problematic. The sister had the right to decide when and how to share her history. The author's action, while possibly well-meaning, violated the sister's privacy and autonomy. Even if the author had doubts about the sister's account, the decision to disclose should have been up to her, not the author.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was extreme, but he had a right to be upset because the information was shared without his consent and without the sister's approval. The author's method of disclosure might have been confrontational or inappropriate, which led to the negative response. \n\nThe sister's response to the author is also extreme, but that doesn't make the author right. The core issue is about privacy and consent. The author didn't consider that the sister might want to handle this disclosure herself, which is a significant boundary issue. \n\nSo, even though the author's intention was good, the action was a breach of privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
