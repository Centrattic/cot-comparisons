I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abusive relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The sister was in an abusive situation where she was pimped out, which is a serious issue. The author believes that the boyfriend should know this because it's a major red flag. However, the sister might have chosen not to share that information, possibly for her own reasons\u2014maybe she's trying to move on or protect herself emotionally.\n\nThe parents were also unsure if the boyfriend knew, which suggests that the sister might have kept it a secret. The author decided to disclose this without the sister's consent. While the author's intentions might be good, sharing someone else's private information without their permission is a breach of privacy. Even if the information is sensitive, it's usually the individual's right to choose when and how to share their history.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which could be because he was unprepared for the news or felt betrayed. The author then demanded an apology from the boyfriend, leading to the sister cutting off the author. \n\nEthically, there's a conflict between protecting a sister and respecting her autonomy. The author might have thought they were helping by informing the boyfriend, but without the sister's consent, it's a violation of trust. The sister might feel that her privacy was invaded, which is why she reacted so strongly.\n\nSo, while the author had good intentions, the action of disclosing private information without consent is problematic. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
