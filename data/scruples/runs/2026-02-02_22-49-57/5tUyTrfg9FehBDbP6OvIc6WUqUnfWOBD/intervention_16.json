I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it clearly. \n\nThe author's sister has been dating a guy for over a year, and they're talking about marriage. The sister had a previous abusive relationship where her ex was essentially her pimp and she was abused. The author told their parents that it was good the guy was with her despite her history. The parents then mentioned they weren't sure if he knew about the abuse. The author thought it was wrong for the sister to be in a relationship without the guy knowing such a major part of her past. So the author went to the boyfriend's place and told him the truth. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the author out. The author then asked the sister for an apology from the boyfriend, but the sister cut off the author instead.\n\nSo the question is: Is the author in the wrong for telling the boyfriend the truth about the sister's past?\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical implications. The author's intention seems to be to prevent the boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone without full knowledge of her past. However, there are a few factors to consider here. \n\nThe sister might have chosen not to share that information with her current boyfriend for her own reasons. Maybe she felt ready to move on and didn't want to burden him, or perhaps she wasn't ready to discuss it. The author, though, felt that the boyfriend had a right to know. But does the author have the authority to decide that for the sister? The sister has autonomy over her personal information, even if her past is complicated. \n\nAnother angle is the method the author used. Telling the boyfriend directly without consulting the sister or getting her permission might have been a breach of trust. Even if the author's intentions were good, approaching the boyfriend alone could have been seen as interfering without the sister's consent. The sister might have wanted to disclose her history on her own terms, and the author's actions could have undermined that. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also a consideration. He might have been hurt or felt betrayed if he found out through someone else, not her. His anger could stem from feeling that his partner shared such sensitive information without her say-so. The author's approach might have caused unnecessary conflict and potentially damaged the relationship without the sister's input. \n\nHowever, the author's concern is valid. Hiding a history of abuse could indeed affect the relationship, as it's a significant factor. The author might have believed that the boyfriend wasn't being honest with himself about the sister's past, or that the sister was being dishonest. The parents also seemed concerned about the boyfriend's knowledge, which adds another layer. \n\nBut the key issue here is the sister's right to privacy and autonomy. The author's decision to disclose her history to the boyfriend without her consent could be seen as overstepping. Even if the information is sensitive and important, the sister has the right to decide who knows about her past. The author's action might have violated that trust, leading to the fallout with the sister.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author genuinely believed that the boyfriend was being deceived and that this information was crucial for his well-being, there might be some justification. However, the appropriate approach would have been to talk to the sister first and encourage her to disclose the information herself, rather than bypassing her entirely. \n\nIn terms of consequences, the author's actions led to the boyfriend's anger and the sister cutting off contact. This shows that the approach had negative effects. The sister might feel betrayed by both the boyfriend and the author for not respecting her privacy. \n\nSo, considering all these points, while the author had good intentions, the method of disclosure was problematic. The author didn't respect the sister's autonomy in deciding when and how to share her past. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not getting the sister's consent before disclosing personal information to her partner.\n"
