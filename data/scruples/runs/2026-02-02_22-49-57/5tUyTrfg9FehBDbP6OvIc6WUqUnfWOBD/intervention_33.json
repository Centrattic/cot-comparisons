I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author, let's call them \"Person A,\" told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abusive relationship. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was treated like a pimp's mistress. Person A thought it was wrong that the boyfriend didn't know this, so they shared the information with him. The boyfriend took offense, yelled, and threw them out. The sister then cut Person A off.\n\nNow, the question is whether Person A is at fault. To decide, I need to consider the ethics and appropriateness of their actions. \n\nFirst, the sister had a traumatic past. Person A's intention was to protect the boyfriend by informing him about her history, thinking he should know if he was considering marriage. But was it right for Person A to disclose this information without the sister's consent? \n\nIn many cultures, personal history, especially sensitive issues like abuse, is considered private. Even if the sister didn't share it, others might not have the right to do so. The sister might have reasons for not disclosing, such as fear of rejection, trauma, or wanting to move past the abuse. By revealing it without her consent, Person A overstepped their boundaries.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, the boyfriend is in a serious relationship, so he might have a right to know about his partner's past. But the sister didn't choose to share it, so it's a question of respecting her privacy versus the boyfriend's right to know. \n\nBut the way Person A did it was abrupt. Telling the boyfriend without discussing it with the sister first could have been hurtful. The sister's reaction shows that she felt betrayed. Even if the intention was good, the method might have been wrong. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's anger could be because he felt violated or that the sister didn't trust him enough to know the truth. But Person A didn't consult the sister, so they acted without her approval. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's generally accepted that you shouldn't share someone's private information unless it's to protect them from harm. But here, the sister might be the one who needs protection from Person A's judgment or the boyfriend's potential reaction. \n\nSo, considering all that, even if the intention was to help, Person A didn't have the right to disclose the sister's private information without her consent. Therefore, they might be in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. If the sister was hiding the abuse, maybe the boyfriend should know. However, the sister might have her reasons for not telling him, and Person A's role was to meddle. \n\nI think the key issue here is consent. By not getting the sister's approval, Person A violated her privacy, which is a significant factor. So, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. However, the sister's autonomy is crucial here, so the answer is likely A.\n"
