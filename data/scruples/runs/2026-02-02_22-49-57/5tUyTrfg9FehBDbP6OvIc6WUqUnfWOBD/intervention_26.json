I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past, which the boyfriend didn't seem to know. The sister had kept it a secret, and the boyfriend reacted angrily. The author then asked for an apology, which led to the sister cutting them off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister had a traumatic experience with her previous boyfriend. The author believes the sister might not be completely honest about her role in that situation. The author's intention was to inform the new boyfriend, thinking that the boyfriend had a right to know because the sister was hiding something major. However, the author didn't get consent from the sister before sharing this information.\n\nThe main question is whether the author overstepped by disclosing the sister's private history. In many cases, privacy is important, especially when it comes to personal and traumatic experiences. The author might have thought they were protecting their sister, but did they have the right to reveal that information without her permission? \n\nOn one hand, the author's concern was valid. The boyfriend was in a serious relationship and might not have known about the sister's past, which could affect their relationship. On the other hand, the sister might have wanted to disclose this herself, and the author's action could have breached her trust.\n\nAlso, the way the author approached the situation\u2014telling the boyfriend directly\u2014could have been a factor in the boyfriend's negative reaction. Maybe a different approach, like discussing it with the sister first to understand her perspective, would have been better. The author's assumption that the boyfriend didn't know and that the sister was hiding it might not have been accurate. The parents' doubt about the boyfriend's knowledge adds another layer.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author acted on their belief without confirming the facts. Sharing such sensitive information without the sister's consent could be seen as a violation of her privacy. The sister's reaction of cutting off the author suggests that the disclosure was hurtful and unexpected. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to help, which complicates things. They might have felt that the boyfriend needed to know to make an informed decision, but the method and consent were lacking. The line between helping and overstepping can be thin in family matters, especially when dealing with trauma.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions could be seen as crossing a line by disclosing the sister's private information without her approval. Even with good intentions, the lack of consent and the resulting consequences (boyfriend's anger, sister cutting off contact) suggest that the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
