I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The sister was in an abusive relationship where she claims her ex was a pimp and she had little agency. The author told the parents, and then when they mentioned the boyfriend might not know, the author went ahead and told him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author had the right to disclose that information. The sister's privacy is a factor here. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend by informing him of the sister's past, but that's a sensitive topic. However, the sister might have had the right to decide what to share about her own history. \n\nThe author is questioning whether it was right to out her sister's trauma without her consent. Even if the author had concerns about the sister's judgment in the relationship, sharing such personal information could be seen as a breach of trust. The sister might feel that her privacy was violated, which led her to end the relationship with the author. \n\nOn the other hand, there's a concern for the boyfriend's well-being, as he was in a serious relationship with someone who had a traumatic past that he didn't know about. But it's also common for people to share their past issues during a relationship, and it's typically the responsibility of the individual to disclose such information themselves. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if their intention was to protect the boyfriend, but the method of disclosure was inappropriate. However, the sister could feel that her privacy was invaded, making the author at fault. The boyfriend's reaction might be due to being surprised or feeling blindsided, which is understandable, but yelling and cutting off the author is extreme.\n\nConsidering these points, it's possible the author overstepped by revealing the sister's private information without her consent. The sister's autonomy in deciding what to share about her past should be respected. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for breaching trust, even with good intentions.\n"
