I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who told their sister's boyfriend about her past is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the sister was in an abusive relationship, maybe even forced into prostitution, and the author told the boyfriend about this without the sister's consent. The boyfriend reacted badly, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's intention was to protect their sister or maybe the boyfriend from being in a bad situation. But did they have the right to share personal information without consent? Even if the sister might have hidden the truth, the author stepping in could be seen as overstepping. Privacy is a big deal, especially in family matters. However, the sister's safety is also a concern. If she was in an abusive relationship before, maybe the author wanted to prevent another similar situation.\n\nThen there's the method. Telling the boyfriend directly without talking to the sister first might have been a mistake. The author could have approached the sister first, maybe expressed concerns and encouraged her to share the information herself. By going straight to the boyfriend, the author might have violated the sister's trust and privacy, which is why the sister is upset.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction was negative, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's abusive. The author might have caused unnecessary conflict. The key here is whether the author had the right to disclose that information. Even with good intentions, disclosing someone's private information without their consent can be a breach of trust, especially in family dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might be in a risky situation again if the boyfriend isn't aware of her past. But the author's approach might have been too direct. Maybe they should have sought guidance from a professional or the parents first. However, the parents were also part of the situation, and the author thought it was important enough to act.\n\nIn terms of the sister cutting off the author, that's a strong reaction, but it's her choice. The author's actions led to that, so there's a responsibility there. The author might not be entirely wrong because they were trying to help, but the method was flawed. So, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because of the breach of privacy, but some might argue B (not in the wrong) due to protective intentions. Need to weigh the privacy vs. potential harm.\n"
