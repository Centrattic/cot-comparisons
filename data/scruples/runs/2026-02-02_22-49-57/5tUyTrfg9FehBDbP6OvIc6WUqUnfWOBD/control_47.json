I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user wrote about their sister's situation where the sister was in a relationship with someone for over a year, possibly planning marriage. The user made a comment to their parents about it being good that the boyfriend was with her despite her history of abuse. Then the parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew about the abuse. The user thought it was wrong for the sister to hide this from her boyfriend and ended up telling him directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelled, and threw them out. The sister then cut off the user.\n\nFirst, I need to assess boundaries. The user is stepping into their sister's relationship, which might be a breach of privacy. Even with good intentions, sharing such personal information without consent could be seen as overstepping. However, the user's concern is about the sister's safety and the boyfriend's awareness of her past, which could be a valid concern if the sister is being deceptive.\n\nBut the key points here are consent and whether the user acted in the sister's best interest. The sister might have chosen not to share her history for various reasons\u2014maybe she's still healing, maybe she doesn't want her past to affect the relationship, or she might be in denial. The user assumed they knew what was best without knowing the sister's reasoning. \n\nAlso, the user didn't confirm with the sister if she wanted to share this information with her boyfriend. By doing so, the user took away the sister's agency in her own relationship. Even if the user believed the boyfriend didn't know, that's a decision for the sister to make. The fallout\u2014boyfriend's reaction and the sister cutting off the user\u2014might be a consequence of violating that boundary.\n\nHowever, there's a counterargument that the user might be trying to protect their sister from potential harm if the boyfriend was unaware of her history. But without knowing the full context, it's hard to say. The user's own doubt about their sister's agency in the past situation is another factor. Still, the method of directly intervening without the sister's consent seems problematic.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user overstepped by sharing the information without the sister's permission. While the intention might have been to help, the approach was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
