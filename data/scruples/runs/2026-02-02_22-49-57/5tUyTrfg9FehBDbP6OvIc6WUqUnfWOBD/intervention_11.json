I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author's sister has been dating a guy for over a year, and they're considering marriage. The sister had a previous relationship where she was in an abusive situation, even being pimped by her ex-boyfriend. The author mentioned to their parents that it's good the new boyfriend is with her despite knowing her history. The parents then said they weren't sure if the boyfriend knew about the abuse. The author thought it was wrong for the sister to be with someone without revealing such a major part of her past, so they told the boyfriend directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the author out. The author then asked the sister for an apology from her boyfriend, but the sister cut off the author.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault here. The user, who is asking for my opinion, thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide between A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. The sister had a traumatic past involving abuse. The author believed that the boyfriend should know this information to make an informed decision about the relationship. However, the sister might have chosen not to share that information for her own reasons\u2014maybe she's not ready, or she believes she's moved on, or perhaps there's something else going on. The author took it upon themselves to disclose this sensitive information without the sister's consent.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be motivated by concern for their sister's well-being and the boyfriend's right to know. But on the other hand, the sister might have a right to privacy and autonomy over her personal history. The author's action could be seen as a breach of trust between siblings. The sister's response\u2014cutting off the author\u2014highlights the emotional impact of this action.\n\nLegally, there might not be a clear violation, but ethically, the line is blurry. The author might argue they were protecting their sister from potential harm, especially if the boyfriend was unaware of the abuse. However, intervening without the sister's permission could be seen as overstepping, especially in a relationship that's serious and potentially marriage-bound.\n\nAnother angle is the boyfriend's reaction. He yelled and threw the author out, which is a strong reaction. But maybe he was hurt or shocked, not necessarily just angry. The author's approach might have been confrontational, which could have escalated the situation. Instead of directly confronting the boyfriend, maybe the author should have discussed it with the sister first to understand her perspective and perhaps encourage her to share the information herself.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might not be entirely wrong because their intentions were to protect their sister. However, the method of disclosure was problematic. They didn't consult the sister, which could have been a better approach. The boyfriend's reaction, while harsh, might be a result of the way the information was presented without prior context from the sister.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might not be in the wrong in terms of intentions but did act without considering the appropriate process. However, the action itself\u2014disclosing someone's private information without their consent\u2014could be seen as crossing a boundary, which is where the fault might lie. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the breach of trust and privacy, even if the intentions were good.\n"
