I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong after telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abusive relationship. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being abused by an ex who was her pimp. The author told the boyfriend about this, thinking it was important because the sister wasn't disclosing it. The parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so the author took it upon themselves to inform him.\n\nNow, the key points here: Did the author have the right to share this personal information without the sister's consent? The sister might have chosen not to tell the boyfriend for various reasons\u2014maybe she was ashamed, not ready, or the relationship wasn't stable enough. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone who has a traumatic past, but that's a big assumption. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend reacted negatively, which led to the sister cutting off the author. The author then demanded an apology, which the sister refused, resulting in a broken relationship. \n\nEthically, sharing someone else's private information without their permission is usually considered a breach of trust. Even if the motive is good, the action can be seen as violating privacy. The sister might have had her reasons for keeping her past private, and the author didn't give her a chance to explain or handle it herself. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe they were preventing potential harm to the boyfriend. But that's a heavy judgment to make without knowing the full context. The boyfriend's reaction was hostile, but that doesn't necessarily mean he didn't deserve to know. However, the author's approach\u2014sneaking information without the sister's knowledge\u2014could have been inappropriate.\n\nIn most cases, advising someone to confront a loved one about their past is one thing, but doing it without consent is another. The author might have acted out of concern, but the method was flawed. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they shared sensitive information without the sister's permission, which is a violation of her privacy and autonomy.\n"
