I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person writing the post) is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out. The author believes the sister might not be fully honest about her past actions and feels that the boyfriend should know. The parents also didn't know if the boyfriend was aware. The author then decides to confront the boyfriend directly, which leads to conflict.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the author had the right to disclose this information. On one hand, the boyfriend has a right to know about a significant past relationship that could affect the future of their marriage. But the sister might have chosen not to share that detail, perhaps out of shame or to protect the relationship. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from potential issues down the line, but the method of disclosure was direct and maybe without considering the sister's consent.\n\nHowever, the author's sister might have her reasons for not sharing her history. Maybe she's still healing and didn't want to burden the relationship. The author's approach could be seen as overstepping, especially since it's her sister's story to tell. Even if the author's motives are good, sharing someone's private information without their consent can be a breach of trust.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was negative, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. But the sister cutting off the author is a big consequence. The key points here are consent and the right to privacy. The author might have acted out of concern but crossed a boundary by revealing the sister's past without her permission. So, the answer leans towards AITA being yes, meaning the author is in the wrong for not respecting their sister's privacy.\n"
