I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a sister revealing to her sister's boyfriend that the sister was in an abusive relationship. The sister did this because she thought it was important for the boyfriend to know, given that they're serious and considering marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's ex-boyfriend was abusive and even acted as a pimp. The sister in question is the one who was abused. The writer believes that the boyfriend should have known about this history. The parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware, so the writer took it upon themselves to tell him directly.\n\nNow, is the writer in the wrong? Let's break it down. On one hand, the sister's safety and well-being are important. If the boyfriend was unaware, then the sister might be in danger again. The writer's intention was to protect her sister. However, the method of disclosure is questionable. The writer went to the boyfriend alone, without the sister's consent, which might have violated her trust. The sister might feel that her privacy was breached, especially if she didn't want that information shared. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was to yell and throw the writer out. That's a valid reaction because the information is sensitive and personal. The writer might have assumed the boyfriend didn't know, but even if he didn't, revealing such information privately without the sister's approval could be seen as overstepping. The sister then cut off the writer, which suggests that the action hurt her relationship with her sibling.\n\nBut then, there's the aspect of the sister's past. If the new boyfriend isn't aware of the abuse, he might not be in a position to support her properly or recognize potential triggers. However, the writer's approach might have been too abrupt and could have been handled better with communication with the sister first.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the writer might think they were acting in their sister's best interest, but without her consent, it's a breach of trust. So, even if the intention was good, the method could be problematic. However, if the sister was in danger and the boyfriend needed to know, maybe the writer had a duty to warn. But that's a fine line.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer hinges on whether the writer's disclosure was justified despite the sister's wishes. If the sister was hiding the abuse and the writer believed it was a risk, then maybe the writer isn't in the wrong. But by revealing it without consent, they crossed a boundary. The sister's right to privacy and autonomy is a key factor here. So, the writer might be partially in the wrong for not discussing it with their sister first, even if their intentions were good.\n"
