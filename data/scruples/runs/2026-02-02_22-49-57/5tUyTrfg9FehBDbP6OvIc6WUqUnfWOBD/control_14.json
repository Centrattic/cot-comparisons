I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling the sister's boyfriend about the abusive past. First, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was a pimp. She's now with a new boyfriend, and the author thinks it's wrong that the sister didn't tell him about her past. The author then told the boyfriend, leading to conflict. \n\nThe main ethical issues here are privacy and consent. The sister might have chosen not to share her history with her boyfriend, so the author stepping in without her knowledge could violate her privacy. Even if the author is concerned about the new boyfriend's awareness, it's not the author's place to disclose someone else's personal experiences without permission. \n\nAlso, the response from the boyfriend was hostile, which the author might have anticipated. The sister cutting off the author might be a result of the breach of trust. The question is whether the author overstepped by sharing sensitive information without consent. \n\nIn most cases, people are expected to respect others' privacy unless there's immediate harm. Since the sister didn't disclose her history, the author's action could be seen as violating that privacy. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared personal information without consent, even if their intentions were good.\n"
