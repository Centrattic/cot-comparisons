I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past, which the sister had kept secret. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut the author off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister had a history of being abused by a previous partner, which could be a significant factor in her current relationship. The author felt it was important for the boyfriend to know this, perhaps to protect him from potential issues. But did the author overstep by sharing this information without the sister's consent?\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to be honest and ensure the boyfriend was aware of the sister's past. This could be seen as a protective measure, especially if the sister was in denial or hadn't disclosed the truth. On the other hand, the author didn't consult the sister first, which might have been necessary to respect her autonomy. The sister might have had reasons not to share that history, maybe she was in a vulnerable state or had made peace with the past.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but that doesn't necessarily make the author right. The key point is whether the author had the right to disclose the information without the sister's permission. In many cases, family members have a right to privacy, so the author might have breached that trust. The parents also didn't confirm if the boyfriend knew, which the author used as a basis to tell him. However, relying on the parents' uncertainty doesn't justify the action if the sister hadn't agreed to share that information.\n\nThe sister cutting off the author is a strong response, but perhaps the author did overstep by not discussing it with the sister first. The author might have thought they were acting in the boyfriend's best interest, but the method was problematic. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to shock or feeling betrayed, but the author's actions might still be considered invasive.\n\nSo, considering the balance between protecting the boyfriend and respecting the sister's privacy, the author might be in the wrong for not seeking the sister's consent before disclosing the sensitive information. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
