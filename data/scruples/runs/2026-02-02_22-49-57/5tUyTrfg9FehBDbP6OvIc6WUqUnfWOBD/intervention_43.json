I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past with an abusive ex who acted like a pimp. The sister had been hiding this history, and the author thought it was important for the boyfriend to know. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the author out. The sister then cut off the author. The author is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister's past is a sensitive and serious matter. The author's intention was to inform the boyfriend of something that could affect his decision to stay in a serious relationship. However, the author didn't consult the sister first, which might be a problem. The sister might have her reasons for not disclosing, maybe she's not ready or fears judgment. \n\nThe author's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, which adds to the uncertainty. The author's action was meant to be helpful, but it's possible the timing or method wasn't appropriate. Telling the boyfriend directly without discussing it with the sister first could have been a breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction was extreme, which might indicate that maybe he wasn't ready to handle that information or had his own issues. The sister cutting off the author is a strong reaction, but it's her way of dealing with the situation.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors are intent, context, and consequences. The author's intent was to protect their sister or the boyfriend from being in a harmful situation. However, the method of disclosure without the sister's consent could be seen as overstepping. The sister's autonomy in deciding what to share about her past is important. \n\nIn terms of ethics, people generally have the right to privacy, even if the information is sensitive. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing, but without the sister's permission, it's a violation of trust. The boyfriend's reaction, while harsh, might be a result of the unexpected disclosure. \n\nSo, the author's action was well-intentioned but possibly misguided. The sister's reaction is extreme, but her autonomy in relationships and how she shares her past is her decision. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's privacy and boundaries.\n"
