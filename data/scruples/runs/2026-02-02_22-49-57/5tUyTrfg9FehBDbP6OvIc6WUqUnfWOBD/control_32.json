I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that their sister was in an abusive relationship, and the sister is now in a serious relationship with a new boyfriend. The author told the boyfriend about the sister's past abuse, which led to a conflict where the boyfriend yelled and threw them out. The sister then cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister might have kept her past secret for a reason. Maybe she wasn't ready to share it, or maybe she felt it was personal. The author's intention was to protect the new boyfriend by informing him of a major issue. But was it right to do so without the sister's consent?\n\nOn one hand, the author might believe they were doing the right thing by being honest, especially if they don't believe the boyfriend was aware of the sister's history. The sister's past is significant, and the new boyfriend should know if he's considering marriage. On the other hand, the author didn't consult the sister first, which could have been a breach of trust. It's possible the sister wanted to handle that conversation herself, and the author's actions might have crossed a boundary.\n\nAlso, the response from the boyfriend was aggressive, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. However, the sister cutting off the author is a big consequence. The author might have overstepped by not getting the sister's permission first. Even with good intentions, sharing someone else's private information without their consent can be seen as a violation of their autonomy.\n\nAnother angle: the author's belief about their sister's agency in the past abuse. If the sister claims she had little agency, the author questioning that might affect their judgment. But that's more about their sister's situation than the immediate action of telling the boyfriend.\n\nSo, the key points are: did the author have the right to disclose the sister's personal information? In many cases, sharing someone's private history without their consent can be considered wrong, regardless of intent. The author might have acted out of concern but without respecting their sister's boundaries. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
