I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the sister's boyfriend being told about her abusive past. The author's sister had a history with an abusive ex who was like a pimp, and the author felt the current boyfriend should know. The parents thought the boyfriend might not know, so the author went to tell him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister kept her abusive past a secret from her boyfriend. The author believes that this is a major issue that a boyfriend should know, especially if they're talking about marriage. However, the sister might have her reasons for not disclosing it, maybe trauma, fear of judgment, or not wanting to burden the relationship. \n\nThe author took it upon themselves to tell the boyfriend without the sister's consent. This is a big step because it's about someone else's private history. Even if the author's intention was to protect the boyfriend, bypassing the sister's autonomy could be problematic. The sister might have wanted to tell him in her own time or not at all, depending on her healing process.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, but that doesn't necessarily justify the author's actions. However, the author did reach out to the sister for an apology, which shows they care about the relationship. The sister's response cutting them off is harsh, but maybe she felt betrayed.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: People have a right to privacy, even in abusive situations. Unless there's a danger to others, the sister's past is her to disclose. The author's action of revealing that information without consent might be a breach of trust. Even if the author had good intentions, the method was invasive. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might not have known, and the author's concern was valid. But the approach was direct and not discussed with the sister first. The sister might feel that her agency in the situation was undermined, which the author themselves had doubts about.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's privacy and autonomy, even if the intention was to help. The correct course might have been to talk to the sister first, encourage her to share the information, and not step in without her consent. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
