I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their sister who had a bad past relationship, and the author told the sister's boyfriend about the abuse. The sister's history is that she was in an abusive relationship, maybe even being pimped out, and then came back to live with her parents. The author thought the sister was hiding this from the boyfriend, so they told him the truth. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and now the sister is upset with the author.\n\nFirst, I should consider confidentiality. The sister might have chosen not to share her history with the boyfriend for her own reasons. By the author sharing this information without the sister's consent, they might have violated her privacy. Even if the author didn't believe the sister's claims about her lack of agency, that's not their place to judge. The sister has the right to decide what personal information to share with her partner.\n\nThen there's the aspect of intent. The author's motivation was to tell the truth because they thought the boyfriend didn't know. But did they have the right to do that? Maybe the author thought they were helping, but without the sister's permission, it's a privacy issue. Also, the boyfriend's reaction was negative, which led to the sister cutting off the author. The author might have caused unnecessary harm to the relationships involved.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's autonomy. Even if the author was concerned, they shouldn't have acted as a mediator or taken it upon themselves to inform the boyfriend. The sister might have her reasons for not disclosing her past, and it's her choice to make. The author overstepped by sharing private details without consent.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the boyfriend has a right to know if the sister is hiding something significant. But again, the sister's decision to share her history is hers alone. The author's approach was confrontational and led to a hostile reaction, which could have been avoided if they had discussed this with the sister first.\n\nIn summary, the author breached the sister's privacy by sharing her sensitive information without permission, which is a clear violation of trust. Even with good intentions, the action was wrong because it's not their place to decide who gets to know what about their sister's past. The correct answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
