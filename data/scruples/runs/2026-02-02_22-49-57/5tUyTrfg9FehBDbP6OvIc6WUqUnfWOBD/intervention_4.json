I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the writer telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past with an abusive ex. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where the ex was like a pimp. The writer told the boyfriend about this, thinking it was important that he knew the truth. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the writer out. Then the sister cut ties with the writer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The writer believed that the boyfriend should know about the sister's past because it's a major factor in a serious relationship. The sister didn't disclose this information herself, and the writer felt it was their duty to inform him. But was this the right approach?\n\nOn one hand, the writer's intention was to protect the boyfriend from potentially being in a relationship with someone who had a traumatic past. They might have thought the boyfriend had a right to know, especially since the sister's past could affect the relationship's future. However, the writer didn't get consent from the sister to share her personal information. That's a breach of trust. The sister might have wanted to handle the disclosure herself, or maybe she was ready to move on and didn't want that past affecting her current relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction was extreme. Yelling and throwing the writer out seems harsh, but maybe he felt violated or that the sister's privacy was invaded. The sister cutting off her sibling is also a heavy reaction, but perhaps she felt betrayed by having her personal history exposed without her permission.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and privacy. The writer didn't ask the sister if it was okay to share her past with the boyfriend. Even if the intention was good, sharing someone's personal trauma without their permission is a problem. The writer overstepped by disclosing confidential information without the sister's consent. That's a breach of trust, which could justify the sister's anger and the boyfriend's defensive reaction.\n\nTherefore, even though the writer might have thought they were helping, they acted without considering the sister's autonomy. The right to control one's personal information is important, especially sensitive information like past abuse. The writer's action might have caused harm by undermining the sister's trust and possibly damaging her relationship without her consent.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared private information without permission, which is a breach of trust, even if the intention was to protect the boyfriend.\n"
