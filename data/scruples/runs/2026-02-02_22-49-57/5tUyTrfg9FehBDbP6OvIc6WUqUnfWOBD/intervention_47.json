I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling the sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship, including being pimped out. The author believed the sister might not have had as much agency as she claimed. The parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware of this past. The author thought it was wrong for the sister to conceal such a major issue from her boyfriend and decided to inform him directly.\n\nThe boyfriend reacted negatively, yelling and throwing the author out. The sister then cut off the author. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nNow, considering ethics and boundaries. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being misled. But was it right to disclose such personal information without the sister's consent? \n\nThere's a conflict between the right to privacy and the duty to prevent harm. The author might believe they were preventing the boyfriend from being in a harmful relationship. However, sharing someone's personal trauma without their permission can be a violation of trust. \n\nAlso, the sister's agency is in question. The author isn't sure if the sister's account of her past is accurate. But it's not the author's role to judge the sister's past. \n\nThe key points are consent and the potential for harm. Did the author have the right to disclose the information? Maybe not. Even with good intentions, sharing such information without consent can damage family relationships. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but that doesn't mean the author was wrong. However, the sister's response to cut off the author suggests a breach of trust. \n\nIn ethical terms, the duty to protect someone else (the boyfriend) might conflict with the duty to respect another's privacy (the sister). It's a tough call. But generally, without the sister's consent, the author overstepped their role. \n\nSo the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong for violating the sister's privacy, even if the intention was good.\n"
