I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about past abuse and pimping the sister endured. The sister had a history with an abusive partner, and the author believes the new boyfriend didn't know about it. The author then confronts the boyfriend directly, leading to a conflict where the boyfriend yells and throws them out. The sister then cuts off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author's intention was to inform the boyfriend about the sister's history, which could be seen as a protective act. However, the method of revealing this information without the sister's consent raises privacy issues. The sister might have wanted to share her past at her own pace, especially in a serious relationship. The author's action could be perceived as overstepping boundaries, even if well-meaning.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern is valid. If the boyfriend wasn't aware of the sister's traumatic history, he might not be prepared to support her properly. The author might believe they were preventing potential harm by ensuring the boyfriend knew the truth. However, the approach was direct and possibly intrusive, which could have been handled differently, like discussing it with the sister first to get her perspective.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014yelling and throwing the author out\u2014suggests he felt blindsided, which the author might not have anticipated. The sister cutting off the author adds emotional weight, showing the impact of the action on family relationships. The key here is whether the author had the right to disclose such personal information without consent, even if the intention was good.\n\nIn ethics, confidentiality is important. Unless there's a legal obligation or imminent harm, revealing someone's private information without their permission is a breach of trust. The author might have thought they were helping, but the method violated the sister's autonomy. So, while the concern is understandable, the action was ethically questionable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not respecting the sister's privacy and autonomy in disclosing her history.\n"
