I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario involves a sister who's in a serious relationship, and the narrator tells the boyfriend about the sister's abusive past, which the sister might have hidden. The boyfriend reacts angrily, and the sister cuts off the narrator.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister was in an abusive situation, and the narrator is concerned about her well-being. But did the narrator have the right to share that information with the boyfriend? There's a balance between protecting the sister and respecting her privacy.\n\nThe narrator's intention was to protect the sister from potentially getting into another bad relationship, especially since the boyfriend didn't know about her past. But the sister might have wanted to disclose that information herself, and revealing it without her consent could be seen as violating her trust.\n\nOn the other hand, if the sister had truly been a victim with no agency, the boyfriend's knowledge might be important for his awareness. However, the narrator's uncertainty about the sister's agency complicates things. The sister might be in denial or not ready to talk about it, so the narrator's action could be premature.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, but that doesn't necessarily mean the narrator was wrong. People can react badly to unexpected news. The sister cutting off the narrator is another factor. The narrator felt justified in their action and wants an apology, but the sister's response is extreme.\n\nLegally, sharing such information might be a breach of privacy, but ethically, it's a gray area. The narrator's concern is valid, but the method of disclosure might have been inappropriate. The key points are consent and the right to privacy versus the duty to protect someone from harm.\n\nIn conclusion, while the narrator's intentions were good, they might have overstepped by not discussing it with the sister first. The answer hinges on whether the sister had the right to keep her history private, which she likely did. So the narrator might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy.\n"
