I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling the sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being abused by a previous partner and was being controlled. The author thought it was wrong that the sister didn't disclose this to her current boyfriend. So the author took it upon themselves to inform the boyfriend, which led to conflict.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle. The sister's privacy is a big factor here. Even if the author was concerned, sharing someone's personal history, especially something as sensitive as abuse, without their consent could be a breach of trust. The sister might not have wanted her boyfriend to know, and the author didn't check with her first. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from potential harm. If the boyfriend was unaware of the sister's past, maybe he wasn't prepared for what he might be getting into. However, the appropriate step might have been to talk to the sister first, not go around her.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was aggressive, which is understandable if he felt blindsided. But the author's direct approach\u2014telling the boyfriend without the sister's knowledge\u2014could be seen as overstepping. The sister then cut off the author, which is a common response when someone feels their personal matters were shared without permission.\n\nSo, the key points are consent and privacy. The author didn't have the sister's permission to share her story, which is a major issue. Even with good intentions, invading someone's privacy in that way is generally wrong. Unless there's a legal duty to report abuse, which isn't mentioned here, the author's action crosses a boundary. Therefore, the answer would be A: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
