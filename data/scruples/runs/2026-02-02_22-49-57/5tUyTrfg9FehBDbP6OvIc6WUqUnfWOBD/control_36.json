I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe sister has a boyfriend she's serious about, maybe even talking marriage. The author noticed that the sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where the previous partner was a pimp. The author believes the sister might be downplaying her role in that situation. The parents were unsure if the current boyfriend knew about this past. The author then decided to tell the boyfriend, even though the sister hadn't disclosed it. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about boundaries, consent to share information, and the potential impact on relationships. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being unaware of something significant. But did the author have the right to share that information without the sister's consent?\n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend's right to know about his partner's past is important, especially if there are red flags. However, the sister might have her reasons for not sharing, maybe she's not ready, or she wants to move on. The author's role as a sibling might give them a sense of responsibility, but stepping in to share such personal information could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, the sister's reaction\u2014cutting off the author\u2014suggests that she felt betrayed. The author's action might have violated her trust, which is a big deal. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing, the method of revealing the information without the sister's consent might be problematic.\n\nBut then, if the sister is being dishonest with the boyfriend, hiding major aspects of her past, that could be harmful in the relationship. The author might believe they were preventing future harm. However, this is a very personal decision, and the author didn't consult the sister first, which could be where the mistake lies.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between protecting someone from potential harm and respecting another person's privacy. The author might not have considered that the sister might have her own reasons for not disclosing, or that the boyfriend's reaction was more about being upset at the situation rather than the author directly. The author's demand for an apology from the boyfriend might also be adding to the conflict, expecting a response that the boyfriend wasn't prepared to give.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author acted out of concern but crossed a boundary by sharing personal information without consent. That's why the sister is upset. The author might not be entirely in the wrong if the intent was good, but the method and lack of consent could make them responsible for the fallout. It's a tricky situation where both sides have valid points, but the action of revealing the information without permission is where the issue lies.\n"
