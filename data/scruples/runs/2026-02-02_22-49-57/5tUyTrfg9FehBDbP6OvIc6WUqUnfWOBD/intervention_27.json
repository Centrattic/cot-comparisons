I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The person's sister was in an abusive relationship, and the sister is now dating someone new, maybe getting married. The author told the sister's new boyfriend about the abuse because they thought it was wrong that the sister didn't disclose it. Then the boyfriend reacted angrily and threw them out, and the sister cut them off for apologizing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister's past is a personal matter. The author might have thought they were protecting the new boyfriend by informing him, but maybe they overstepped. Was the author supposed to be the one to disclose the sister's past? Usually, that's the sister's responsibility, not her sibling's. The author's intentions could be good, but the method might be problematic. \n\nAlso, the author approached the boyfriend directly without talking to their sister first. That could be seen as betraying her trust. The sister might have chosen not to share that information with her current partner, and the author didn't check if she wanted to disclose it herself. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is harsh, but if he didn't know, the author's action could cause unforeseen consequences. If the boyfriend does know, maybe he's in denial, but the author's approach might have been confrontational. \n\nThe sister's response is extreme, but it's a reaction to feeling her privacy was invaded. The author's demand for an apology from the boyfriend adds another layer. Maybe the author should have first discussed this with their sister, not the boyfriend.\n\nSo, even if the author had good intentions, by not respecting the sister's autonomy and privacy, they might be in the wrong. The answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they shared sensitive information without the sister's consent.\n"
