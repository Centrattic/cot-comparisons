I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about their sister's abusive past. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was treated like a pimp and was abused. The author's parents weren't sure if the boyfriend knew this, so the author decided to tell him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing them out. Then the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's concern is about the boyfriend not knowing the sister's history, which could affect their relationship. Abuse survivors often have complex situations, and sharing such information without consent can be a big deal. The author might think they're doing the right thing by protecting their sister from someone who might not be suitable, but they might have overstepped.\n\nBut wait, the sister was the one in the abusive relationship. The author's sister might have chosen to keep that information private, maybe because she's still healing or doesn't want to be judged. The author's action of revealing this to the boyfriend could be a breach of trust. Even if the author has their sister's best interests at heart, they didn't get her consent to share that information. The sister's autonomy is important here. She has the right to decide who knows about her past.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction could be due to shock or feeling violated. Even if he didn't know, the way the information was presented might have been intrusive. The author didn't consider the sister's wishes or her relationship with the boyfriend. By doing this, the author might have caused more harm by breaking trust and causing conflict.\n\nThe sister cutting off the author is a consequence, but it's the result of the author's actions. The key point is whether the author had the right to share that information. Since the author didn't consult the sister, they might be in the wrong. The sister's agency in her own life and relationships is crucial here. The author's intent might be good, but the method was inappropriate. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
