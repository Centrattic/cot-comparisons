I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister was in an abusive relationship with her ex who was also her pimp. She's currently dating someone new, and the author thinks it's important this new guy knows about her history because it's a major factor in why someone would stay with her. The author tells the boyfriend, who reacts negatively, and then the sister cuts off the author. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author's intention was to inform the boyfriend of something significant that could affect their relationship. However, the way the author approached it was directly confronting the boyfriend without consulting the sister first. Even if the author believed the sister was hiding the truth, the method of disclosure might have been problematic. The sister might have had reasons for not telling her current boyfriend, maybe she's still healing or wanted to move on without past trauma affecting her new relationship.\n\nThe author's action could be seen as a breach of the sister's privacy and autonomy. Even if the intention was good\u2014to protect the boyfriend from potential issues\u2014the author didn't consider the sister's right to share her own story. Additionally, the fallout was severe: the boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off contact. This outcome suggests that the author's approach might have been too direct and not considering the sister's feelings or her agency in the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt that the boyfriend deserved to know about the sister's past to make an informed decision, especially since they were discussing marriage. But the key point is whether the author had the right to disclose that information without the sister's consent. In many cases, sharing someone else's personal information without their permission can be considered a violation of trust, even if the intent is to help.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the sister's privacy and handled the situation in a way that led to conflict and harm to their relationship. The sister should have had the choice to share her own history with her partner, not have someone else do it for her. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
