I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. The situation involves the sister's history with an abusive ex who was also her pimp. The author felt that the boyfriend didn't know about this and thought it was wrong for the sister to hide it. Then they told the boyfriend, who reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister kept her past a secret from her boyfriend. The author, knowing about this, decided to inform the boyfriend. The key question is whether the author had the right to do so. \n\nOn one hand, the sister's past is a significant issue that could affect her relationship. If the boyfriend didn't know, maybe he was being kept in the dark, which isn't healthy for the relationship. The author might think they're helping by ensuring transparency. But on the other hand, the author didn't consult the sister first. Breaking someone's confidentiality without their consent can be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nThe sister's reaction to the author is also extreme. Cutting the author off completely and being hostile might be an overreaction, but it's her right to feel upset about her personal information being shared without her permission. The boyfriend's reaction was also harsh, but it's possible he was shocked or hurt by the revelation. \n\nThe author's intention was to tell the truth, but the method might be questionable. They didn't approach the sister first to discuss the situation or get her permission. Instead, they went directly to the boyfriend, which could be seen as violating the sister's privacy. The sister's history with abuse is sensitive, and the author's action might have been well-meaning but misguided. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author did act without the sister's consent. Even if their intentions were good, sharing personal and potentially damaging information without permission can harm relationships. The sister's right to privacy is important, and the author overstepped by not discussing it with her first. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they breached confidentiality without the sister's consent, even if their intentions were to help.\n"
