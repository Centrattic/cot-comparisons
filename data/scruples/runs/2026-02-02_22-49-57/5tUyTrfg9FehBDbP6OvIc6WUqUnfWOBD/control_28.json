I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling the sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse.\n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being in a controlling relationship. The author felt it was important for the boyfriend to know this since they were serious and considering marriage. The parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, which made the author think it was the right time to tell him. \n\nBut wait, the sister hadn't told him herself. The author decided to step in without the sister's consent. That's a key point. The sister might have had reasons for not sharing her past, maybe she was ready in her own time, or maybe she didn't want to burden him. The author bypassed her and went straight to the boyfriend, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThen, the boyfriend reacted negatively. He yelled and threw the author out. His reaction was harsh, but that's his response. The author then asked for an apology from the boyfriend, which led the sister to cut off contact. The author's motivation might be good\u2014if they were trying to protect their sister\u2014but the method was questionable.\n\nConfidentiality is important here. The sister's story is sensitive, and sharing it without her permission could violate her privacy. Even if the author thought it was for the sister's good, the sister might feel betrayed. The author didn't consider her boundaries or how she wanted to handle the situation. \n\nSo, the main issue is the breach of trust. The author didn't have the right to disclose such personal information without the sister's consent. Even if the intention was to protect her, the action was a violation of her autonomy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the sister's privacy and made a decision that should have been hers to make.\n"
