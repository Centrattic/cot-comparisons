I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a sister's boyfriend being told about the sister's past with an abusive ex. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being abused, which is a serious matter. The author mentioned this to her parents and then directly to the boyfriend. The key points here are about confidentiality and consent. The sister might have chosen not to disclose her past to her current boyfriend, so by revealing that information, the author might have overstepped.\n\nNow, the author's intention was to tell the truth, but was it their place to do so? Family dynamics can be tricky. Even if the author thought it was important for the boyfriend to know, the sister might have wanted to share that information herself on her own terms. The boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which could be due to being surprised or feeling that the sister's privacy was violated. \n\nThe author then demanded an apology from the boyfriend, which led to the sister cutting off the author. The question is whether the author had the right to disclose the information. If the sister didn't want the boyfriend to know, the author's action could be seen as a breach of trust. However, if the author believed the boyfriend's continued relationship was risky without knowing the full context, maybe there's a justification. \n\nBut generally, personal and sensitive information is the individual's to share. Unless there's a legal obligation or immediate danger, others shouldn't disclose it without consent. The author might be in the wrong because they revealed something private without the sister's permission, which is a violation of her privacy and could damage relationships. So the answer is likely A.\n"
