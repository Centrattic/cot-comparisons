I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. The author's sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship, and the author feels that the current boyfriend should know this. The author told the boyfriend directly, which led to a confrontation and the sister cutting off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister is the one who hasn't disclosed her past, which is a significant issue in a serious relationship. The author's intention was to inform the boyfriend, believing that he had a right to know. However, the method of disclosure was directly to the boyfriend without the sister's consent, which might cross a boundary.\n\nOn one hand, the author's concern is valid because the boyfriend should be aware of such a crucial part of her history, especially since they're considering marriage. On the other hand, the author took it upon themselves to disclose this information without consulting the sister, which could be seen as an overstepping. The sister might feel that her privacy was violated, even if the intention was to protect the boyfriend.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was extreme, yelling and throwing the author out. But that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong. The boyfriend's response might indicate that he wasn't prepared for the information, but the author's action was an attempt to inform him. However, the sister's subsequent cutting off the author complicates things. The author might have damaged their relationship with the sister, which is a consequence they have to consider.\n\nI should also think about the sister's agency. The author is unsure about the sister's claims about her past. If the sister is genuinely in recovery and has moved on, the author's intervention might not be helpful. But if there are still risks, the author's concern is justified. However, the right to privacy is important. The author might have assumed they were acting in the boyfriend's best interest, but the way they did it could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between protecting someone and respecting another person's autonomy. The author's action could be seen as a breach of confidentiality, even if the sister didn't share her past. The boyfriend might have a right to know, but the author's approach might not have been the best. Maybe the author should have encouraged the sister to disclose the information herself instead of doing it directly.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's intention was to inform the boyfriend of important information, which is a valid concern. However, the method of disclosure without the sister's consent might be where the author went wrong. While the intent was good, the action taken could be seen as overstepping boundaries. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's privacy and autonomy in deciding what to share about her past.\n"
