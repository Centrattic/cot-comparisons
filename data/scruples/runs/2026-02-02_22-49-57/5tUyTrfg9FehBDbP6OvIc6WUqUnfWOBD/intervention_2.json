I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abusive relationship. The sister had a history of being in an abusive situation where her ex was like a pimp, and she came back to live with her parents. The author thinks it's wrong that the sister was hiding this from her current boyfriend. The parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware, so the author decided to tell him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the author out. Then the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the author's actions. Was the author justified in revealing this information? The sister's past is a significant part of her history, and it's something that a serious partner should know. The author's intent was to inform the boyfriend, which could be seen as trying to protect him from a potential problem or ensure he's making an informed decision. However, the author didn't go through the sister to tell her boyfriend. That might be a problem because personal information, especially sensitive ones, should ideally come from the individual involved. The sister might have had her reasons for not disclosing her past, even if the author disagrees with that.\n\nThen there's the question of the author's right to intervene. Family dynamics can be complex here. The author might believe they're helping by being honest, but by bypassing the sister, they took away her agency in deciding what to share. The sister might have been working on moving past that trauma and not wanted to bring it up. The author's action could be seen as overstepping, even if the intent was good. Also, the boyfriend's reaction could be due to being blindsided by the information, which the author presented without the sister's consent.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend was in a serious relationship, talking about marriage. The sister's past could indeed affect their future, and withholding such information might be a red flag. The author's concern might be genuine, thinking that the boyfriend deserves to know to make an informed choice. But the method of disclosure was direct, not through the sister, which complicates things.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: In many places, there's no law against sharing information about a family member unless it's confidential medical or legal information. But ethically, it's about consent and respect for privacy. The author didn't get the sister's permission, so that's a potential issue. The sister's autonomy in choosing whether to disclose her past is important. The author's action might have caused harm by breaking trust between the sister and her sibling, and possibly between the sister and her boyfriend if he felt she was hiding things.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, while harsh, might be a reaction to being told something so personal without the sister's input. The author might not be in the wrong if their intention was to help, but the method was problematic. However, the sister's response of cutting off the author suggests that the sister felt her privacy was violated, which could mean the author overstepped.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intention was to inform the boyfriend for his own good, the action of doing so without the sister's consent is where the problem lies. The sister's right to privacy and autonomy in choosing what to share with her partner is a key factor. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's agency in disclosing her own past.\n"
