I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's sister was in an abusive relationship that was essentially pimping. The sister is now in a new, serious relationship, and the author believes her new boyfriend should know about her past. The author told the boyfriend, who reacted angrily, leading to the sister cutting off the author. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nI need to consider a few points. The sister's right to privacy versus the boyfriend's right to know about her past. The author's motivation: was it to protect the new boyfriend or to address their own concerns about their sister's behavior? The sister's history is traumatic, and sharing that without her consent could be a breach of trust. \n\nThe author mentions they're unsure if the sister had little agency in her past, which adds a layer of judgment. Maybe the author feels the sister is repeating patterns or not being honest. However, even if the author's intentions are good, did they overstep by disclosing confidential information without the sister's permission?\n\nIn relationships, partners do share their pasts, but the sister might have chosen not to disclose that part. The author's action could be seen as violating the sister's confidentiality, even if the author thinks it's for a good reason. The boyfriend's angry reaction might stem from feeling blindsided or disrespected, especially if the sister had not shared it herself.\n\nOn the other hand, if the sister was hiding significant abuse, the boyfriend has a right to know. But the author's method of disclosure\u2014without the sister's consent\u2014could be problematic. The sister might feel betrayed by her sibling, leading to the fallout. \n\nSo, the key factors here are consent to share the information and the intent behind the disclosure. If the author believed the sister was hiding something important that could affect the relationship, but didn't get her consent first, that's a breach of trust. Even if the author's intention was to help, the method was inappropriate. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they disclosed personal information without consent, leading to strained relationships. The answer would be A.\n"
