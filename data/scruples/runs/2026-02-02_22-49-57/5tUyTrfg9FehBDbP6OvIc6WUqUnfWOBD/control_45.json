I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling the sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister is in a serious relationship, possibly talking about marriage. The author feels that her sister's current boyfriend should know about her past with an abusive partner who was also her pimp. The author's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so the author decided to tell him directly. \n\nNow, the key points here are consent and privacy. The sister might not have shared her past with her current boyfriend, so the author is stepping in without her knowledge. Even if the author thinks it's for the boyfriend's benefit, sharing someone else's private information without their consent can be problematic. \n\nThe author's intention might be to protect the boyfriend from a potentially manipulative situation, but they're making an assumption about the sister's agency in her past. The author isn't sure if the sister had as little agency as she claims, which introduces some judgment about the sister's experience. \n\nWhen the author tells the boyfriend, he reacts negatively, which leads the sister to cut off the author. The author then demands an apology from the boyfriend, which the sister refuses by cutting off the author. \n\nEthically, the main issue is the breach of trust with the sister. The author didn't check with her first, assuming they knew what was best. Even if the information is true, sharing it without consent can be seen as violating the sister's privacy. The boyfriend's reaction is extreme, but the author's action might still be considered wrong because they didn't respect the sister's autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, if the sister's past is something that significantly affects her current relationship, the boyfriend has a right to know. However, the right to know is typically the sister's to disclose. The author took it upon themselves to share this information, which might not be their place. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't obtain consent from the sister before sharing her private information, leading to a breakdown in their relationships. The answer could be A.\n"
