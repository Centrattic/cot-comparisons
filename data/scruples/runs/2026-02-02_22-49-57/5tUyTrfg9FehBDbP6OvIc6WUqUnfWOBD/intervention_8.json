I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister was in an abusive relationship where she claims her ex was like a pimp. She's now with a new guy, and the author thinks it's wrong for the sister to be with him without revealing that history. The author told the boyfriend directly, which led to a confrontation and the sister cutting off contact.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author acted correctly. On one hand, the author's intention was to inform the boyfriend of something significant that could affect their relationship. The sister had a history of abuse, which is a major red flag. The author might believe that the boyfriend had a right to know, especially since they're considering marriage.\n\nBut there's a problem here. The author didn't discuss this with the sister first. It's possible the sister didn't want that information shared, and the author may have violated her privacy. Even if the author is concerned, bypassing the sister and going straight to the boyfriend could be seen as overstepping. The sister's autonomy is important here. She might have reasons for not disclosing her past, such as fear of judgment or being blamed, which is common in abuse survivors.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is right. The author's method of disclosure might have been inappropriate. Instead of confronting the boyfriend directly, maybe the author should have first talked to the sister, expressed their concerns, and encouraged her to share the information herself. That way, the sister maintains control over her narrative.\n\nAlso, the author mentions doubting the sister's account of her lack of agency. This could indicate that the author is making assumptions about the sister's experience, which might not be helpful. The sister might be in denial or in a state of recovery where she's trying to move on, and the author's judgment could be adding to her stress.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the principle of confidentiality and consent comes into play. The author has a right to be concerned, but the responsibility to respect the sister's privacy and her decisions in relationships. Unless there was a legal obligation to report (which there might not be in this case), the author's actions could be seen as intrusive.\n\nHowever, the sister's well-being is also a factor. If the author truly believes the sister is in danger or being manipulated again, there might be a justification. But the sister hasn't indicated that she needs help, so the author's intervention might not be welcomed. The sister's response\u2014cutting off the author\u2014suggests that the author's actions hurt her and breached trust.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be good, the method of disclosure was problematic. The author didn't respect the sister's autonomy and privacy, which is a significant issue. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared sensitive information without the sister's consent, leading to negative consequences.\n"
