I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abusive relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister had a history of being abused by a previous partner, who was essentially her pimp. The sister is now in a serious relationship with this new guy, and the author thinks it's wrong that she hasn't told him about her past. The parents even mentioned they weren't sure if he knew, which might have influenced the author's decision.\n\nThe author went to the boyfriend's apartment and directly told him. The boyfriend reacted negatively, yelling and throwing the author out. The sister then cut off the author after they asked for an apology from the boyfriend. \n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries and consent. The author is stepping into a relationship dynamic that's not their own. While the sister's past is serious, the author's right to disclose that information without the sister's consent is questionable. Even if the author's intentions were to protect the boyfriend from a potentially harmful situation, the method of disclosure might have been inappropriate. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction could be due to surprise, anger, or not knowing how to handle the information. The author's demand for an apology from the boyfriend might have been too much, especially if the sister didn't agree with the disclosure. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's past is significant, and the boyfriend might have a right to know if it affects their relationship. However, the author's role here is as a sibling, not a mediator. The sister should be the one to decide when and how to share her history. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be overstepping by revealing private information without the sister's approval. While the intent might have been to help, the action violates the sister's privacy and could damage the relationships involved. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
