I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about them telling their sister's boyfriend about her abusive past. \n\nFirst, the sister was in a relationship where her ex-boyfriend abused her and acted like a pimp. She's now with a new guy for over a year, talking about marriage. The author told their parents that it was good the new guy is with her despite her history. The parents then mentioned they weren't sure if he knew about the past. The author thought it was wrong for the sister to hide such a major issue, so they directly told the boyfriend. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing them out. The author then asked the sister for an apology, but she cut them off.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about privacy, consent, and the right to know. The sister might have chosen not to disclose her history to her current boyfriend for her own reasons. Maybe she wanted to move on, protect herself, or wasn't ready. By the author revealing this without her permission, they might have violated her privacy. Even if the author's intention was to protect the boyfriend, sharing such sensitive information isn't the sister's to disclose. \n\nBut then again, if the boyfriend had a right to know about the sister's past, especially if it's relevant to their relationship, then the author might be in the right. However, the sister's agency in her past is a factor. The author mentions they're unsure if the sister had as little agency as she claims, which might imply they think she's not being honest. But it's not the author's place to question her account or share that. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but maybe because he felt blindsided. The author didn't ask the sister if it was okay to share before doing so. That's a big issue. The sister's response to the author's demand for an apology by cutting them off suggests she's upset that her privacy was breached. \n\nSo, even if the author thought they were doing the right thing, they didn't respect their sister's autonomy. The sister should have the right to decide when and how to share her history. The author overstepped by not getting her consent first. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
