I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past trauma. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being abused and pimped by a previous boyfriend. The author believes that the current boyfriend might not know this, so they decide to tell him. The parents also seem to think the boyfriend might not be aware. The author's intention is to protect their sister, thinking that the boyfriend should know this major detail before considering marriage.\n\nBut the boyfriend reacted negatively, yelling and throwing the author out. The sister then cuts off the author. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. On one hand, the author is trying to protect their sister from potential harm by ensuring the boyfriend is fully informed. On the other hand, sharing such personal information without the sister's consent could be seen as a violation of her privacy. The author might have assumed they were acting in her best interest, but they didn't discuss it with her first. \n\nThe sister's trauma is a sensitive issue. Even if the author has doubts about her sister's agency, the sister might have reasons for not disclosing the past to her current partner. The author's action could have caused unintended harm by damaging the relationship without the sister's consent. \n\nIn terms of boundaries, family members shouldn't necessarily share others' private information unless there's a clear risk and consent. The author's approach might be well-intentioned but crossed a line into the sister's autonomy. \n\nSo, while the author's intentions were to help, the method was problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they shared personal information without the sister's permission, which violated her privacy and potentially caused more harm than good.\n"
