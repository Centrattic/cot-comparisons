I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their sister's boyfriend about the abusive past is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history with an abusive ex, possibly being pimped. The author thought it was wrong that the boyfriend didn't know this. The parents weren't sure if he knew. The author went to the boyfriend and told him, which led to a confrontation. The boyfriend yelled and threw them out. Then the sister cut off the author.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries and consent. The author didn't consult the sister before sharing her private information. Even if they thought it was in her best interest, sharing personal trauma without her permission is a breach of privacy. The sister might have her reasons for not telling her boyfriend, maybe she's not ready or it's too painful. The author's action could be seen as violating her autonomy. \n\nThen there's the reaction of the boyfriend. He was angry, but that doesn't mean he's right; people might react strongly to unexpected news. However, the author's approach was direct and potentially hurtful. They didn't consider the sister's feelings or her decision to keep that information private. \n\nThe sister cutting off the author is a consequence of the breach of trust. The author might have good intentions, but the method was wrong. The question is whether the author overstepped by sharing without permission. In most cases, privacy is important, so the author is likely in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
