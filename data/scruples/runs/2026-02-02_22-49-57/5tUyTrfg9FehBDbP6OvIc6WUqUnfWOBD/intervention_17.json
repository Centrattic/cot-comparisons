I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author did the wrong thing by telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abusive relationship. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was treated like a pimp. Now she's with a new guy, and the author thought it was wrong to hide that history. The author told the boyfriend, who then reacted negatively. The sister cut off the author.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was right or wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being misled. The sister's past is a significant red flag, and not disclosing it could lead the boyfriend into a harmful situation. The author might believe they were helping the boyfriend make an informed decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't consult the sister first. The sister might have valid reasons for not sharing her past, maybe she's not ready, or she's trying to move on. The author's action could be seen as an invasion of privacy, especially if the sister had asked them not to share that information. Also, the author's method of confronting the boyfriend directly might have been harsh and could have been handled differently, like talking to the sister first to understand her perspective.\n\nBut then again, the author was concerned about the sister's well-being. If the sister is still in a vulnerable state, maybe the boyfriend should know to protect himself. However, the way the author approached it led to conflict. The boyfriend's reaction was extreme, but maybe that's his issue. The author's intent was to be honest, which is typically considered a good trait. \n\nHowever, without knowing the sister's stance on sharing her past, the author might have overstepped. The sister might have chosen to disclose her history when she felt ready, and the author's action could have undermined her autonomy. Also, the sister cutting off the author might be a reaction to feeling betrayed, which is significant.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's intent was to be truthful and protect the boyfriend, but they bypassed the sister's trust and possibly her wishes. The sister's autonomy in deciding what to share is important. Even if the author's intention was good, the method might be questionable. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's boundaries, even if the information was sensitive.\n"
