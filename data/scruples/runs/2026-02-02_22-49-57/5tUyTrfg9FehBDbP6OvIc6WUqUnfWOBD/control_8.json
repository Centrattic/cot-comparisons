I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. The situation is that the sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was like a pimp, and she's now dating someone for over a year, possibly considering marriage. The author told the parents that it's good the guy is with her knowing her history, and the parents doubted if he knew. Then the author went to the boyfriend and told him the truth, which led to a confrontation where the boyfriend yelled and threw them out. The sister then cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of sharing someone's private information. The sister's past is a sensitive topic, especially regarding abuse. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by protecting their sister or ensuring the boyfriend knows the truth. But did they have the right to do that without the sister's consent? \n\nIn many cases, people who have been through abuse are advised to disclose such information on their own terms. The author's action could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the author believed the boyfriend should know, sharing it without the sister's permission might be crossing a boundary. The sister might be trying to move past that trauma and not ready to talk about it. The boyfriend's reaction might be due to surprise, shock, or not knowing how to process the information, which the author might not have expected. \n\nThen, the sister's response to the author is harsh, implying she feels betrayed. The author's demand for an apology from the boyfriend could further strain the relationship. The key issue here is consent and the sister's right to privacy. The author's intent was to act truthfully, but the method of disclosure without the sister's approval is problematic. \n\nAlso, the parents' reaction is a clue. They were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so maybe the sister didn't tell him. The author's role is to support the sister, not to act as a mediator or truth-teller without her permission. \n\nThere might be cultural or family norms involved, but generally, sharing someone's trauma without their consent is considered a violation. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of the intent, but the action of disclosing private information without permission is where the issue lies. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because they shared their sister's confidential information without her consent, which can be a serious violation of trust, even if their intention was to help.\n"
