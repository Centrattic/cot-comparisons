I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer telling their sister's boyfriend about their sister's past abuse. The key points here are the intent behind sharing the information, the right to privacy, and the consequences that followed.\n\nFirst, the sister's history with abuse is a serious matter. The writer felt it was important for the boyfriend to know because it's a significant detail that could affect the relationship, especially since they're considering marriage. The writer's motivation was to protect their sister and ensure the boyfriend was fully informed. However, the method of sharing this information directly with the boyfriend without consulting the sister could be problematic. \n\nThe sister might have valid reasons for not wanting to disclose her past, such as fear of judgment or wanting to move on. The writer's actions bypassed the sister's autonomy, which could be seen as overstepping. Even if the writer had good intentions, the sister's right to decide what to share about her own experiences is important. By revealing this information without her consent, the writer may have violated her privacy and trust.\n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend's negative reaction doesn't necessarily mean the information wasn't important. It shows that the timing or method might have been off. The writer's demand for an apology from the boyfriend after the confrontation might also have been too much, especially without considering the sister's stance on the matter. \n\nSo, while the writer's intentions were to do the right thing, the approach taken might not have respected the sister's agency and privacy. The key issue here is consent and autonomy. The writer might have acted out of concern, but the method was flawed. Therefore, the answer could lean towards the writer being in the wrong because they shared sensitive information without the sister's permission, which could have been handled differently to respect her boundaries.\n"
