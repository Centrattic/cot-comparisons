I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe author's sister has a boyfriend, and they're in a serious relationship, possibly considering marriage. The sister had a past abusive relationship where her ex was basically her pimp, and she came back to live with her parents after that. The author made a comment to their parents about the boyfriend being good for her despite her history. The parents then mentioned they weren't sure if the boyfriend knew about the past. The author thought it was wrong for the sister to keep this information from her current boyfriend, so they went to the boyfriend's place and told him directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the author out. The author then asked the sister for an apology from the boyfriend, but she cut off contact, saying the author can \"fuck off.\" The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister had a traumatic past involving abuse. The author felt that the current boyfriend should know about this because it's a major issue that would likely affect any serious relationship. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone who has such a history, which he might not have known about. However, the author didn't go through the sister to inform the boyfriend, which might be a problem because the sister is the one who has the responsibility to disclose her own history, especially if it's sensitive and personal.\n\nOn one hand, withholding such a significant aspect of one's past could be seen as a red flag in a relationship. The author might have thought that the boyfriend had a right to know, as it's something that could impact their future together. But on the other hand, the author didn't consult the sister first, which could be a breach of trust. Siblings often share personal information, but revealing a sister's past without her consent, especially in a situation that's so intimate and traumatic, might cross a boundary. The sister might feel that her privacy was violated, and the author's action could be seen as overstepping, regardless of the intention.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was extreme, but the way the author approached the situation might have contributed. Approaching the boyfriend directly without the sister's knowledge could be seen as interfering in their relationship. The sister's response of cutting off contact suggests that she felt betrayed, which might be justified if she didn't consent to her past being shared. While the author's intention was to protect the boyfriend, the method used could be problematic. The ethical dilemma here is between the right to know and the right to privacy. The boyfriend does have a right to know about his partner's past, but the sister has the right to decide when and how to disclose such information.\n\nThere's also the question of the author's own judgment. The author mentions they're unsure if they believe the sister's account of having little agency. This could indicate that the author is making assumptions about the sister's past, which adds another layer. If the author is not entirely sure about the sister's story, sharing it might be based on incomplete or potentially inaccurate information. That could be a reason for the author's actions being misguided.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sister should have been the one to disclose her history if she felt it was necessary for the relationship. The author's role is to support their sister, and by going behind her back, the author might have caused more harm than good. The sister now feels she can't be in a relationship with the author, which is a significant consequence. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of trying to do the right thing, but the approach was perhaps too direct and without considering the sister's autonomy and privacy.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the author breached the sister's privacy, made a decision to disclose sensitive information without her consent, and the method used to do so was confrontational and led to a breakdown in the family relationship. Even if the intention was good, the action was not appropriate.\n"
