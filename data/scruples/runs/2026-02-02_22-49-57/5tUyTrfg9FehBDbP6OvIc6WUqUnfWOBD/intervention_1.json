I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her abusive past. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the sister had a past abusive relationship where she was treated like a pimp's victim. She's now in a serious relationship with a new guy, and the author thinks it's wrong to not tell him about that history. The author's parents thought the boyfriend might not know, so the author went ahead and told him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author had the right to disclose that information. Let's consider the ethical aspects. The sister's history is a very personal and sensitive matter. Even if the author has concerns about the sister's judgment or her lack of acknowledgment of her past, does that justify sharing it with the boyfriend without the sister's consent?\n\nOn one hand, the author might believe they're protecting the boyfriend from potential manipulation if the sister isn't being honest. However, the sister has the right to decide what information to share about her past. By not consulting her, the author bypassed her autonomy, which could be a breach of trust. The sister might feel that her privacy was violated, especially since the information is so sensitive.\n\nAnother angle: the author's parents were involved, but the author took it upon themselves to act. Even if the parents were unsure, the author's decision to disclose directly to the boyfriend might have been hasty. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to surprise, anger, or feeling betrayed, but that doesn't make the author right if they overstepped.\n\nAlso, the author's belief about the sister's agency in her past situation might be subjective. The sister might perceive her past differently, and the author's judgment could have influenced their actions. The fallout resulted in the sister cutting off the author, which indicates a significant breach in their relationship.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key issue is the lack of consent from the sister. While the author's intentions might be to protect the boyfriend or the sister, the method of disclosure without her knowledge is problematic. It's possible that the author could have approached the sister first to discuss their concerns, rather than going straight to the boyfriend. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's autonomy and privacy, even with good intentions.\n"
