I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's sister was in an abusive relationship with an old boyfriend who was basically her pimp. She came back to live with her parents after that. Now, the sister has a new boyfriend, and the author thinks it's important that the new guy knows about her past. The author told the sister's current boyfriend about her history, even though the sister had kept it a secret. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the author out. The sister then cut the author off from her life.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects of sharing someone's private information. The sister didn't share her past with her current boyfriend, which led the author to believe that the new guy wasn't aware. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from potentially being in a relationship with someone who had a traumatic history. But was the author right to do that?\n\nConfidentiality is a big factor here. The sister might have chosen not to disclose her past for various reasons\u2014maybe she felt ashamed, wasn't ready, or wanted to move on. The author stepping in and revealing that information without the sister's consent could be seen as a violation of trust, especially between siblings. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern is valid. If the boyfriend didn't know about the sister's traumatic past, he might not have been fully informed about her history, which could affect their relationship. But the author didn't consult with the sister first. Instead of asking the sister if she wanted to share her past with her boyfriend, the author took it upon themselves to do so. That might have crossed a line.\n\nAlso, the way the author approached it\u2014going to the boyfriend's apartment and telling him directly\u2014could be seen as confrontational. The boyfriend's reaction was extreme, but maybe it was because he felt blindsided. The sister's response to cut off the author is also a strong reaction, but that's perhaps a separate issue.\n\nSo, the key points are: breach of confidentiality, the intention behind the action, and the method used to share the information. Even if the author had good intentions, the action of disclosing private information without consent is generally considered wrong. The sister had the right to decide what to share about her past, and the author's decision to intervene without her permission might be ethically questionable. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong, even if their motives were good.\n"
