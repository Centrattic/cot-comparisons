I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling the sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was a pimp. She's now dating someone new, and her sister (the author) feels that hiding this fact is a problem. The author told the boyfriend, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The sister might have chosen not to share her past with her new boyfriend. By revealing this information, the author may have crossed a boundary. Even if the author's intention was to protect the boyfriend, it's not their place to disclose someone else's personal history without permission.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014yelling and throwing the author out\u2014suggests he felt betrayed by the sister's secrecy. However, that doesn't mean the author was right to share the information. The sister's privacy is important, and the author's action might have violated that trust. The sister cutting off the author is a consequence, but the author might have overstepped.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was concerned about the sister's well-being, thinking she might still be in a harmful dynamic. However, the sister's agency in her current relationship is her own to manage. The author's judgment about the sister's past might also cloud their objectivity. \n\nSo, the main issue is the unauthorized disclosure of personal information. Even with good intentions, the author didn't have the sister's permission. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
