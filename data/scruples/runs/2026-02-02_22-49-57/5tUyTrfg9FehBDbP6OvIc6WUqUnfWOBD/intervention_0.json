I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past.\n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out. The author thinks the boyfriend might not know this and decides to tell him. The parents also seem unsure if the boyfriend knows. The author's reasoning is that it's wrong for the sister to be in a serious relationship without disclosing such a major part of her past.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author have the right to disclose this information? Was the sister's boyfriend entitled to know? The author's motivation was concern for their sister's well-being and the belief that the boyfriend should know about the past to make an informed decision. However, the sister's agency is questioned\u2014whether she was truthful about her past and if she was ready to move on.\n\nBut, sharing someone's private information without their consent, even if done with good intentions, can be problematic. The author didn't consult the sister first, which might have been a better approach. By doing so, they bypassed the sister's autonomy to decide what to share about her past. Even if the author thought the boyfriend should know, the sister might have her reasons for not disclosing, such as rebuilding trust or not wanting to relive traumatic experiences.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was aggressive, but that doesn't necessarily make the author right. The situation is complex because there's a conflict between the author's intentions and the sister's right to privacy. The sister cutting off the author might be her way of protecting her relationship, even if the author thought they were helping.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions were driven by concern, but they overstepped by not discussing it with the sister first. The sister's past is sensitive, and sharing it without her consent could be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, the boyfriend might have a right to know if it affects the relationship's future. However, the author's method of sharing the information without the sister's input complicates the matter.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's intent might be understandable, but the action of disclosing private information without consent is ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
