I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post did the right thing by telling the sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was essentially pimped out. The author overheard her parents mention that the boyfriend might not know about this, so they decided to tell him. The boyfriend then reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the author out. The sister cut off the author after that.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nHmm. From an ethical standpoint, the author's intention was to protect the boyfriend by sharing important information that could affect the relationship. However, there's a line between helping and overstepping. The author didn't consult the sister first, which could be a problem. The sister might have wanted to tell the boyfriend herself, and by the author stepping in, they might have violated the sister's autonomy. \n\nOn the other hand, the situation involves abuse, which is serious. If the boyfriend didn't know, the author might be trying to prevent potential harm if the boyfriend was unaware and the sister was still vulnerable. But the author's approach might be seen as invasive. The sister's reaction is extreme, but maybe she felt betrayed because the author didn't talk to her first. \n\nIn terms of boundaries, the author's role as a sibling could be a factor. Siblings often have each other's backs, but sharing such personal information without permission can be crossing a line. The author might have good intentions, but the method was problematic. \n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's a case to be made that they overstepped. However, considering the severity of the abuse history, the author's concern for the boyfriend's well-being is understandable. It's a tough call. Some might argue the author had a duty to inform, especially if there's a risk of the situation repeating. Others might say it's the sister's choice when and how to share her past. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author had the right to disclose the information without the sister's consent. Even with good intentions, that could be a breach of trust. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the sister's autonomy. But the situation is complex because it's about preventing potential harm. \n\nBut in most ethical frameworks, respecting someone's autonomy is key. Unless there's a duty to warn (like if the sister was a danger to the boyfriend), the author might have crossed a line. Since the sister didn't want the information shared, the author's action could be seen as violating that trust. So, I'm leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they disclosed private information without the sister's consent, even if their intentions were good.\n"
