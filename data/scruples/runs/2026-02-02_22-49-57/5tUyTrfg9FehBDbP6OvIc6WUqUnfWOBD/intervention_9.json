I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about her past abusive relationship where she was a victim of abuse and pimping. The parents thought the boyfriend might not know, so the author decided to inform him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent of the author. Their reasoning was that the sister was hiding a major aspect of her past that could affect the relationship. The author believed that the boyfriend should know the truth, especially since they were planning to get married. But the sister might see the author's action as an overreach, invading her privacy, and breaking trust.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to protect the sister's future partner by revealing important information. However, sharing someone's personal and traumatic history without their consent can be seen as a violation of their privacy. The sister had the right to disclose her past on her own terms. The author assumed the role of deciding when and how that information should be shared, which might have crossed a boundary.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, though harsh, might be due to being blindsided by the information. The sister's response in cutting off the author is also a reaction to the breach of trust. Legally and ethically, sharing someone's personal information without their consent can be problematic, even if the intent is good. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intention, but in terms of action, it's a breach of privacy. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they disclosed sensitive information without permission, regardless of the reasons.\n"
