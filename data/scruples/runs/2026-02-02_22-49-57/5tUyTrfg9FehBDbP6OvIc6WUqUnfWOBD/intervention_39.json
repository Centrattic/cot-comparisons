I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the past abuse. \n\nFirst, the sister was in an abusive relationship where she claims she had little agency. The author told the boyfriend about this, thinking it was important for him to know since they were serious and considering marriage. The boyfriend reacted angrily and the sister cut off the author.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) Did the author have the right to share this information? 2) Was it necessary to tell the boyfriend directly? 3) How did the author handle the situation appropriately?\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to protect their sister from potential harm by ensuring the boyfriend was aware of her history. That's a valid concern, especially if there's a risk of future abuse. However, the author didn't consult the sister first, which might have been a privacy breach. The sister might have valid reasons for not wanting to share her past, maybe trauma or fear of judgment. By going around her and telling the boyfriend, the author might have undermined her autonomy.\n\nBut then again, the sister's safety is a priority. If the boyfriend wasn't aware, maybe the author was trying to prevent another harmful relationship. However, reacting by confronting the boyfriend directly without the sister's consent could be seen as overstepping. The boyfriend's anger might stem from feeling disrespected or blindsided, and the sister's reaction shows she values her privacy and autonomy.\n\nIn ethical terms, there's a balance between protecting someone and respecting their decisions. The author acted out of concern but didn't respect their sister's choice to keep her past private. The sister might feel that her agency was violated again by having her history shared without her consent. The boyfriend's reaction, while harsh, might indicate he felt the information was shared inappropriately.\n\nSo, the author's intention was good, but the method was flawed. They should have discussed this with the sister first, given her control over her narrative. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect their sister's autonomy.\n"
