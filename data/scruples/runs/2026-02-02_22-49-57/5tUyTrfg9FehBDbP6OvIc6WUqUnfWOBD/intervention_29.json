I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So the user is asking whether the person who shared the story (the author) is in the wrong for telling her sister's boyfriend about her past with an abusive relationship. The options are A for yes, B for no. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister has been dating a guy for over a year, and they're planning marriage. The author comments to their parents that it's good the guy is with her considering her history, which includes an abusive ex who was like a pimp. The parents then mention they're not sure if the boyfriend knows. The author thinks it's wrong to hide such a significant issue and decides to tell the boyfriend directly. He reacts badly, yelling and throwing her out. The sister then cuts off the author.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries and the right to privacy. The author's sister has a right to privacy regarding her past, and sharing that information with her partner might be a decision she should make. However, the author's intention was to protect her sister by ensuring the boyfriend knew the truth, which could affect the relationship's future. \n\nBut here's the conflict: the author is stepping into a role of mediator or judge in her sister's relationship without her consent. Even if the author has good intentions, revealing personal and sensitive information without the sister's approval can breach trust and violate her privacy. The sister might have reasons for not telling her boyfriend, such as fear of rejection, stigma, or wanting to move past the trauma. The author's action, while well-meaning, didn't consider these aspects and caused harm to her relationship with both the boyfriend and the sister.\n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend's reaction might stem from surprise and distress, but that doesn't necessarily justify his behavior. However, the author's decision to disclose the information without the sister's consent is ethically questionable. The sister might feel betrayed, which explains her cutting off the author.\n\nSo, while the author's intention was to protect her sister, the method was inappropriate. The right approach would have been to discuss it with the sister first, respecting her autonomy to decide what to share and when. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because she overstepped her boundaries.\n"
