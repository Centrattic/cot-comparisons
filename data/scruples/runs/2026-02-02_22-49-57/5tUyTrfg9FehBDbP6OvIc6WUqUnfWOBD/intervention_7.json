I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abusive relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister is in a serious relationship, possibly considering marriage, with a guy. The author believes the sister is hiding her history of being abused and pimped by an ex. The parents are unsure if the boyfriend knows about this. The author decides to tell the boyfriend, which leads to a confrontation where the boyfriend yells and throws them out. The sister then cuts off the author.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the boyfriend should know this major part of the sister's past. But the sister's reaction and the boyfriend's anger complicate things.\n\nNow, considering ethics and boundaries. The author is a family member, but they didn't get consent from the sister to share this information. Even if the author has good intentions, sharing someone's private information without their permission can be a violation of trust. The sister might have reasons for not telling the boyfriend, maybe she's not ready or dealing with the trauma. The author's action might have breached that trust, even if it was to protect the boyfriend.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might think they're acting in good faith to prevent the boyfriend from being blindsided later or to protect him from a potential harmful relationship. However, the line between helping and meddling can be thin. The author's approach was direct and not discussed with the sister first, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, the sister's response\u2014cutting off the author\u2014shows how much this breach of trust hurt. The boyfriend's reaction might be due to shock or feeling betrayed by the sister's secrecy, not necessarily the author's intent. But the author's responsibility here is tricky. They might have thought they were doing the right thing, but the method was flawed.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author's action was a breach of confidentiality. While their intentions could be noble, the lack of consent and the resulting harm suggest that they are in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
