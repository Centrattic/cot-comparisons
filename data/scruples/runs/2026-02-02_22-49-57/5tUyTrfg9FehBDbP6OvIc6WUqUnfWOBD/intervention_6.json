I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister is in a serious relationship, and there's a history of abuse from her past. The author, concerned about the sister's well-being, mentions to the parents that the boyfriend might not know about this history. Then, the author directly tells the boyfriend the truth. The boyfriend reacts angrily, and the sister cuts off the author.\n\nNow, considering ethics and boundaries. The author's intent was to protect their sister by being honest with the boyfriend. But was it their place to do so? Family dynamics can be tricky here. The sister might have chosen not to disclose her past, perhaps to protect herself or because she feels it's not the boyfriend's business. The author's action could be seen as overstepping, even with good intentions. \n\nBut on the other hand, if the sister is in a potentially harmful situation because the boyfriend isn't aware of her history, the author might feel a duty to act. However, the method of disclosure matters. Approaching the boyfriend directly without the sister's consent could be invasive. The sister's autonomy is important; she might have her reasons for not sharing that information. \n\nLegally, there's no obligation to disclose someone else's past unless there's a risk of harm. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author might believe they're helping, but they could have caused unintended harm by violating trust between the sister and the boyfriend. The sister's reaction suggests she felt betrayed, which is a significant consequence. \n\nThe boyfriend's anger might stem from feeling disrespected or from the sister not having shared the information herself. The author's action could be seen as interfering in the sister's relationship. Even if the intent was good, the sister's decision to cut off the author indicates that the action was harmful to the family relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions were to protect their sister, the approach taken was inappropriate. The sister has the right to decide what information to share about her past. The author overstepped by not consulting the sister first and disclosing personal information without consent. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
