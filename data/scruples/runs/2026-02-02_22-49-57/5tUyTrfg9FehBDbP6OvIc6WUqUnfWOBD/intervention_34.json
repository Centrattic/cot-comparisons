I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex-boyfriend was abusive and even acted like a pimp. She came back to live with her parents. Now, the sister has a new boyfriend, and the author believes that the new boyfriend doesn't know about the sister's past. The author tells the sister's boyfriend about the abuse, which leads to a bad reaction. The boyfriend yells and throws the author out. Then the sister cuts off the author.\n\nThe author thinks the sister was hiding this major issue from her boyfriend, which is a big deal. The author's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so the author decided to tell him. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The author's goal was to be honest and protect the boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone who has a traumatic past that might affect the relationship. But did the author have the right to intervene like that without the sister's consent? \n\nOn one hand, the sister's past is her own story to tell. The author might feel protective, but revealing someone's private information without their permission can be a breach of trust. Even if the author thought it was for the boyfriend's benefit, the sister might see it as her own business. \n\nOn the other hand, if the sister was hiding a serious issue, the boyfriend might not be making an informed decision about the relationship. The author might believe that the boyfriend has a right to know if it's going to impact their future together. But the author's approach was direct\u2014telling the boyfriend without the sister's knowledge. That could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was extreme, but people can react badly to shocking news. The author might not be responsible for that reaction, but the act of revealing the information without consent is questionable. The sister cutting off the author is a result of that action, which the author might not have anticipated.\n\nSo, the key points are: consent to share someone else's personal information, the right to privacy, and the potential for causing harm. Even with good intentions, sharing personal secrets can be wrong if it's not the author's information to share. The author might have thought they were helping, but the sister's autonomy in deciding what to share about her past is important. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's privacy.\n"
