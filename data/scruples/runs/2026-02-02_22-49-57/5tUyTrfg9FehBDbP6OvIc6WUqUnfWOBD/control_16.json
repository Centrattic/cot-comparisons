I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the sister was in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out. The author thinks she might not be being honest about her lack of agency. The parents weren't sure if the new boyfriend knew about this history. The author decided to tell the boyfriend, which led to a confrontation where the boyfriend reacted angrily and the sister cut off the author.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author had the right to disclose this personal information. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being in a relationship without knowing the full truth. But did they have the authority to do that? The sister might have kept it private for a reason, maybe to avoid stigma, protect her privacy, or for other personal reasons. The author's action could be seen as a breach of trust between the sister and her partner. \n\nHowever, the situation involves a serious issue\u2014abuse. The author is concerned about the sister's well-being and the boyfriend's right to know. If the sister was hiding something so significant that it could affect the relationship, the author might feel it's their duty to inform him. But the way it was handled\u2014without consulting the sister first\u2014could be problematic. The boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but that's his response, not necessarily the author's mistake.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not know the full context of the sister's past. They mention being unsure about the sister's agency, which suggests there could be nuances they're not aware of. The sister might have reasons for not disclosing the abuse, like fear of judgment or not wanting to burden her partner. The author's decision to out her could have caused more harm, leading to the sister cutting them off.\n\nSo, the author's intentions were good, but the method might have been wrong. They didn't consider the sister's autonomy and privacy. Even with good intentions, sharing such personal information without consent can be a breach of trust. The boyfriend's reaction was extreme, but the author might still be in the wrong for not respecting their sister's boundaries.\n"
