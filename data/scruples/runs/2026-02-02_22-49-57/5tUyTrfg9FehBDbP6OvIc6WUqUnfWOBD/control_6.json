I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about their sister's past abuse without the sister's permission. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was treated like a pimp, and now she's in a serious relationship with this guy. The author thought it was wrong that the sister didn't tell the boyfriend about her past, so they went ahead and shared the information.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had the right to do that. The sister might have chosen to keep her past private, and the author stepping in could have violated her trust. Even if the author believed the boyfriend should know, the sister has the right to disclose her own history. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since the sister might not appreciate the intervention.\n\nThen, the boyfriend's reaction was to yell and throw the author out. That's a strong response, but maybe he was shocked or upset. However, the author's approach might have been abrupt, and the boyfriend's reaction could be a result of that. The author then demanded an apology from the boyfriend, which might not be the right approach. Instead of focusing on the sister's well-being, the author is now creating a rift by holding the sister accountable for her boyfriend's reaction.\n\nAlso, the sister cutting off the author seems like a consequence of the breach of trust. The author inserted themselves into the relationship without the sister's consent, leading to the sister feeling betrayed. So, the author's actions might have prioritized their own judgment over the sister's autonomy and privacy. \n\nIn terms of ethics, confidentiality is important in family matters unless there's a risk of harm. The author might have thought they were helping, but without knowing if there was a risk of the boyfriend being a threat, their intervention was unnecessary. The sister's choice to share her past is hers to make, and the author's disclosure could have damaged her current relationship and trust with her family.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely overstepped by disclosing the sister's personal history without her consent, leading to strained relationships. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
