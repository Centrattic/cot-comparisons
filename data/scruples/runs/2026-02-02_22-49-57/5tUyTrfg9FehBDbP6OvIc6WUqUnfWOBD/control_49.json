I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about their sister's abusive past, which the boyfriend was supposedly unaware of. The sister had kept this a secret, and the author felt it was important to reveal it because it's a major issue that could affect the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister had the right to privacy, and maybe the author overstepped by not discussing it with her first. However, the sister's safety and well-being are also important. Abuse victims might not be ready to share their past, and the author might have thought they were helping. But did they have the right to disclose such personal information without consent?\n\nThen there's the part about the sister's agency. The author isn't sure if the sister had as little agency as she claims. That's a bit of a red flag. The author's judgment about the sister's past might be clouding their decision. Maybe the sister is in a vulnerable position and the author is projecting their own doubts onto her.\n\nThe parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so the author took it upon themselves to inform him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, which could be due to being shocked or because he felt disrespected. The author then asked for an apology, leading to the sister cutting ties. \n\nSo, the key points are: breach of trust with sister, potential violation of privacy, intentions versus consequences. The author might have good intentions but crossed a line. On the other hand, if the sister's past could affect her future safety, maybe the author had a duty to inform the boyfriend. But the method was problematic. It's a tough call. Typically, in such cases, the expectation is that personal information, especially about abuse, is shared by the individual themselves. The author's action might be seen as overstepping, hence AITA? Maybe A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consult the sister first. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to protect their sister. But generally, privacy and autonomy are important. So leaning towards A.\n"
