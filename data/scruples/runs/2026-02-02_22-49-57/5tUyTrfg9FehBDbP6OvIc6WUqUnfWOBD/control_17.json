I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (AITA) did the wrong thing by telling the sister's boyfriend about her past abuse.\n\nFirst, the sister was in a previous abusive relationship where she was treated poorly, maybe even pimped. The author thinks it's wrong that she didn't tell her current boyfriend about this history. The parents also weren't sure if the boyfriend knew. So the author decided to tell him directly.\n\nThe boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the author out. Then the sister cut off the author, saying they can't be in her life anymore.\n\nNow, considering the situation. The author's intention was to be honest and protect her sister's future partner from being in a relationship with someone who has a traumatic past. However, the author didn't consult with the sister first. The sister might have had a reason for not disclosing her past, maybe she's healing, or it's a personal matter she handles herself. By the author stepping in, it's possible that she overstepped her boundaries.\n\nEthically, people have a right to privacy. Unless there's immediate danger, others might not have the right to share someone's personal history without their consent. The sister might have chosen to move on and not let her past define her current relationship. The author's actions, while coming from a place of concern, might have violated her sister's privacy and autonomy.\n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend's reaction could be due to being blindsided by the information. But it's also possible he was upset because the information was shared without his consent. The author didn't give the sister a chance to address it herself, which might have been a better approach.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author acted without the sister's permission, shared sensitive information, leading to conflict. The sister's autonomy is important here. Whether the author was in the right depends on whether the information needed to be shared. Since it's her sister's personal history, the author might have overstepped, making her the AITA.\n"
