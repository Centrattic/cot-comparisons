I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister was in an abusive relationship where she was pimped. The author thinks it's wrong that the boyfriend didn't know about this history. The parents mentioned they weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, so the author took it upon themselves to inform him.\n\nNow, the main question is whether this was the right move. The author's intention was to protect their sister or maybe help the boyfriend make an informed decision. However, the boyfriend reacted negatively, leading to a breakdown in the author's relationship with their sister.\n\nI need to think about boundaries here. The author is a sibling, but sharing personal information without consent can be a breach of privacy. The sister might have chosen to keep her past private, so the author stepping in might have overstepped. Even if the author's intentions were good, the method might have been inappropriate. The boyfriend's reaction was defensive, but that doesn't mean the author was wrong. It's a tricky situation because it's about protecting someone versus respecting their autonomy.\n\nAlso, the sister's response was to cut off the author, which is extreme, but maybe she felt her privacy was violated. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by being honest, but perhaps they should have talked to their sister first instead of going straight to the boyfriend.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their sister's privacy, even with good intentions. The right approach might have been to discuss it with the sister and let her decide what to disclose, rather than acting unilaterally.\n"
