I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author's sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was abusive and even acted like a pimp. The sister is now in a serious relationship with a new boyfriend, maybe even talking marriage. The author told their parents that it's good the new guy is with her considering her history. The parents then mentioned they weren't sure if he knew about the past. The author decided to tell the boyfriend directly, which led to the boyfriend yelling and throwing the author out. The sister then cut off the author after they asked for an apology from the boyfriend.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's decision to disclose sensitive information about their sister's past to her boyfriend without her consent. The main ethical issue here is whether the author has the right to share such personal information, even if it's for a good reason like protecting their sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality and consent. The sister may have chosen not to tell her current boyfriend about her past. By revealing that information, the author is interfering in their relationship. Even if the author's intention was to help, they didn't get permission from their sister. That's a big red flag because it's not the author's place to disclose someone else's private information unless there's a legal obligation, which isn't the case here.\n\nNext, the author's assumption about their sister's agency in the previous situation. They mention not being sure if they believe how little agency the sister claims she had. This skepticism might be valid, but that doesn't justify outing her to the boyfriend. The author is taking it upon themselves to judge and act on their sister's behalf, which can be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe reaction of the boyfriend and the sister shows that the author's actions caused significant harm. The boyfriend's anger could be due to being blindsided, and the sister cutting off the author is a direct consequence of her feeling betrayed. The author's justification is that they were trying to protect their sister, but without her consent, this could be seen as violating her autonomy.\n\nAnother angle is the author's right to intervene in a family matter. While families do get involved in each other's lives, there's a line between concern and overstepping. The author's actions might be considered a breach of trust if the sister wanted to keep her past private. The sister's right to privacy and her decision on what to share with her partner is important here.\n\nAlso, the author's approach was confrontational. Instead of talking to their sister first and discussing the concerns, they went straight to the boyfriend. This approach is problematic because it doesn't allow for a discussion between the sister and her partner. It's possible the boyfriend already knew or the sister was planning to tell him, but the author's disclosure messed that up.\n\nIn terms of ethics, disclosing private information without consent is generally wrong unless there's immediate harm. The author's action was based on their own judgment, not a legal or safety concern. There's no indication that the sister was in danger or that the boyfriend was a threat. The author's intervention might have done more harm than good by damaging the sister's relationship and causing family rifts.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's actions were a breach of their sister's privacy, done without consent, leading to negative consequences. Therefore, they are likely at fault here.\n"
