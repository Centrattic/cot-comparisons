I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario involves their sister's boyfriend not being told about her past with abuse and possible pimping by her ex. The author told the boyfriend the truth, which led to the boyfriend yelling and the sister cutting off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's right to privacy. She might have chosen not to share her past with her boyfriend for various reasons. Maybe she wasn't ready, maybe she thought he already knew, or maybe she didn't want to burden him. The author stepping in to reveal that information could be seen as an overreach, especially if the sister didn't want it disclosed. The author's parents also mentioned uncertainty about whether the boyfriend knew, which adds complexity. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern is valid. A history of abuse and pimping could affect a relationship, and the boyfriend might have a right to know if his girlfriend is involved with someone who has such a background. However, the author's method of disclosure was direct and possibly confrontational. Yelling and being thrown out suggests the boyfriend was caught off guard, which might not be the best way to handle sensitive information.\n\nAlso, the sister's reaction is harsh, but it's her choice to distance herself. The author's intention was to protect her new partner, but it came at the cost of family relationships. The key issue here is whether the author had the right to disclose private information without the sister's consent. In many cases, sharing someone's private details without their permission can be considered a betrayal of trust, even if the intent is good. \n\nSo, while the author's concern might be understandable, the act of disclosing the sister's past without her consent could be seen as a violation of her privacy. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. But I should also consider cultural or familial norms where family members might feel responsible to step in. However, the sister's autonomy is important, and her choice to keep that information private should be respected unless there's immediate harm involved. Since the abuse is in the past and the sister is in a new relationship, the author's disclosure might not be justified. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they broke their sister's trust by sharing her private information without her consent, even if their intentions were good.\n"
