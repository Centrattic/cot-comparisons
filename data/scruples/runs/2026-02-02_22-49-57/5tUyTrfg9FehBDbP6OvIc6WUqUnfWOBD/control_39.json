I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is at fault for telling her sister's boyfriend about the abuse history without the sister's consent.\n\nFirst, the sister had a past abusive relationship where she was pimped out. The author believes the sister might not be telling the truth about her lack of agency, but that's another point. The parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew about this. The author felt it was wrong for the sister to not disclose this to her current boyfriend, so she went to the boyfriend and told him. He reacted angrily and the sister then cut ties with the author.\n\nSo, the key issue here is consent and privacy. The author didn't ask the sister if it was okay to share this information. Even if the author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being in a potentially harmful situation, sharing such personal and sensitive information without consent can be problematic. The sister might have reasons for not disclosing her past, maybe she's in therapy, rebuilding trust, or it's her choice how to handle her relationships. The author's action might have breached confidentiality and trust between the sister and her partner. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to being blindsided, but that doesn't mean the author had the right to share the information. The sister's response to the author is extreme, but it's a consequence of the author's actions. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's privacy and autonomy over her personal history.\n"
