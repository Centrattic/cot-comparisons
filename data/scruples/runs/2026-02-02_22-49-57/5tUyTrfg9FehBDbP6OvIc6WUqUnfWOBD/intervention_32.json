I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the sister's boyfriend being told about the sister's past abusive relationship. The key points here are the intent behind the disclosure, the method used, and the consequences.\n\nFirst, the author's motivation: they wanted to protect their sister, thinking she was hiding a major issue that could affect her relationship. The sister's ex was abusive, which is a serious matter. The author might have felt it was necessary for the boyfriend to know to make an informed decision.\n\nBut the method is questionable. The author went directly to the boyfriend without consulting the sister first. Even though the intention was good, sharing such personal information without the sister's consent can be seen as a breach of trust. The sister might feel that her privacy was invaded, especially if she chose not to disclose that history to her current partner herself.\n\nThe parent's reaction also adds complexity. They mentioned uncertainty if the boyfriend knew, which might have influenced the author's decision. However, it's the sister's responsibility to share her past if she feels comfortable doing so, not the author's role to step in.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which the author might not have anticipated. Yelling and throwing the author out suggests that the information was not received well, possibly due to the way it was delivered. The author then demanded an apology from the boyfriend, which led to the sister cutting off the author.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they were trying to protect their sister. On the other, they shared sensitive information without consent, leading to a fallout. The sister's right to privacy and autonomy in her relationship is a key factor here. The author overstepped by disclosing the information directly to the boyfriend instead of discussing it with the sister first and respecting her choice to share or not.\n"
