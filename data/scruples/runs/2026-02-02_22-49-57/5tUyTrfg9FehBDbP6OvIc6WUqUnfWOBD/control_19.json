I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out. The author was concerned because she thought her sister was hiding this from her new boyfriend, who they were planning to marry. The author told her parents, and they said they weren't sure if the boyfriend knew. Then the author went to the boyfriend's apartment and told him. He reacted angrily, yelling and throwing her out. The sister then cut off the author.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intention was to protect her sister by being honest, but she did it without the sister's consent. She might have overstepped by revealing personal information without permission. The boyfriend's reaction was hostile, and the sister is upset with the author for interfering.\n\nI need to consider if the author had the right to share that information. In many cases, sharing someone else's private information without their consent can be a breach of trust. Even if the author had good intentions, it's important to respect the sister's autonomy. The author might have thought she was helping, but the sister's reaction shows that she didn't want her past shared, which could have been her choice to disclose or not. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's past is significant, and the boyfriend having that information could affect his decision to marry her. However, the author's method of sharing the information directly to the boyfriend without discussing it with the sister first might have been the main issue. The author should have perhaps talked to her sister first to understand her perspective and see if she wanted to share it herself.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but the author can't control how he responds. The sister cutting off the author is a consequence of the breach of trust. So, even if the author's intentions were good, the action itself was a violation of privacy. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her sister's boundaries and privacy.\n"
