I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their sister's boyfriend about the abusive past is in the wrong. The question is whether that action was justified.\n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship, where she was treated like a pimped person. The author felt that the boyfriend should know this major aspect of her past because it's a significant red flag for a serious relationship. The parents also weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, which might have added to the author's concern.\n\nThe author went to the boyfriend and told him directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, which could be because he was blindsided or because he felt the information was private. The sister then cut off the author, which complicates things because it shows a family rift.\n\nNow, considering ethics and boundaries. Family members often have a duty to protect each other, but also need to respect each other's autonomy. By not consulting the sister first, the author overstepped. The sister might have chosen to keep that information private, and sharing it without her consent could be seen as violating her trust. Even if the author's intentions were good, the method was without consent. The boyfriend's reaction might be a result of being blindsided rather than the content itself.\n\nHowever, the situation involves potential harm. If the boyfriend was unaware of the sister's history, knowing might affect his willingness to stay in the relationship. But the author didn't have the sister's permission to disclose this. So, while the intention was to protect the sister, the method was inappropriate. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key issue is consent to share personal information. Without the sister's approval, sharing such a sensitive topic with her partner is a breach of trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the sister's autonomy to decide when and how to share her past.\n"
