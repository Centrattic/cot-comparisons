I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is at fault for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. Hmm. First, I need to understand the situation properly.\n\nThe sister had a past abusive relationship where she was pimped, and the author feels she's not being truthful with her current boyfriend. The author told the boyfriend about this, leading to a conflict. The sister then cut off the author.\n\nSo, the key points are: the sister's history, the author's intent to help, the method of disclosure, and the reactions involved.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the boyfriend should know this important information because it's a major factor in a serious relationship. But did the author have the right to disclose this without the sister's consent? That's a big question. Privacy is a big issue here. The sister might have chosen not to share her past, maybe for her own reasons or because she's not ready. The author stepping in could have violated her trust.\n\nThen there's the method. The author went directly to the boyfriend instead of talking to the sister first. Maybe the sister wanted to handle it on her own terms. The author's actions might have caused harm by outing her sister's private information without her permission.\n\nBut there's also the concern for the sister's well-being. If the current boyfriend is unaware of the abuse, he might not be in a position to support her properly. However, the author's approach was confrontational and led to a hostile reaction, which might have damaged the sister's relationships further.\n\nThe parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so maybe the author thought it was necessary. But even if the intention was good, the sister's autonomy should be respected. The author didn't consult her first, which could be a breach of trust.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, even with good intentions, disclosing someone's private information without their consent is generally wrong. The sister might have valid reasons for not sharing her past, such as fear of judgment or stigma. The author's action bypassed her agency, which is problematic.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was aggressive, but that doesn't necessarily justify the author's actions. However, the author's justification for telling the truth was based on the boyfriend's right to know. But again, it's about consent and who has the right to share that information.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's intentions were to protect the sister's future partner, but the method and lack of consent make this a violation of the sister's privacy. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
