I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship with an ex who was like a pimp. The author told the boyfriend because they thought it was important for him to know, especially since they're planning to get married. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone who had such a traumatic past. But did they have the right to disclose that information without the sister's consent? The sister might have chosen not to tell the boyfriend for various reasons\u2014maybe she felt ready to move on, or she feared rejection, or maybe she was still processing her trauma. By the author revealing this, they might have violated the sister's privacy and trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend was being misled if the sister hadn't told him about her past. The author could argue that they were trying to do the right thing by ensuring he was making an informed decision. However, the method of disclosure was direct and without the sister's consent, which complicates things.\n\nThe sister's reaction is also a factor. She ended the relationship with the author, which is a strong response. The boyfriend's anger towards the author might stem from feeling blindsided or not knowing how to handle the information. But the author's approach could have been more considerate, perhaps by talking to the sister first to understand her side and encourage her to disclose the information herself.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, there's no wrongdoing, but ethically, it's a gray area. The author might have overstepped by not respecting the sister's autonomy in deciding when and how to share her past. Even if the author's intentions were good, the action of disclosing without permission can be seen as a breach of trust. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect the sister's privacy and autonomy, even with good intentions.\n"
