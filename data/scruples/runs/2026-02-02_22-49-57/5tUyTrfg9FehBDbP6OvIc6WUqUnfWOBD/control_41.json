I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author did the right thing by telling their sister's boyfriend about her past. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was like a pimp. She's now with a new guy they've been talking marriage for over a year. The author thinks it's wrong to hide this past because it's a major issue. The parents also weren't sure if the boyfriend knew. The author told the boyfriend, who reacted angrily and threw them out. The sister then cut off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics. Is it the author's place to share such sensitive information? The sister might have chosen not to tell her current boyfriend for various reasons\u2014maybe she's not ready, maybe she's in denial, or maybe she's trying to move on. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being misled, but maybe they overstepped by not discussing it with the sister first.\n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend didn't know, the author could argue they were preventing him from making an informed decision. But the problem is that revealing such personal trauma without consent can be very harmful. The sister might feel betrayed, and the boyfriend's reaction (yelling and throwing the author out) might indicate he felt invaded. The author then asked for an apology from the boyfriend, which led to the sister cutting ties.\n\nLegal and ethical boundaries: In many places, sharing someone's private information without their consent, even for a good reason, can be a breach of privacy. The sister might have a right to control her narrative. The author's actions could be seen as violating that right. However, if the author honestly believed the boyfriend was being deceived and that the sister was in danger or not being truthful, there might be a defense, but that's tricky.\n\nAnother angle: The author's doubt about the sister's agency in the abusive situation. The author isn't sure if the sister had no agency, which complicates things. Maybe they have their own biases about the sister's experiences. But regardless, the author's decision to disclose without the sister's consent might be crossing a line.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might have been to protect the boyfriend, the method was problematic. The author should have probably discussed this with the sister first, ensuring her consent and understanding the situation better. Without that, the author's actions could be seen as overstepping, even if the motive was good. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they shared private information without consent, leading to negative consequences.\n"
