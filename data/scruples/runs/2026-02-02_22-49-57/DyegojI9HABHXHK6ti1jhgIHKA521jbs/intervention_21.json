She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who bought their pregnant wife a yoga pass for her birthday is in the wrong. The wife has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness, and is on temporary disability. The husband thought exercise might help her depression from missing work and get her out of the house. The wife didn't like the gift and her friends supported her, saying he was an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Hypermesis gravidarum is a serious condition. It's not just morning sickness; it's persistent vomiting that can lead to dehydration and other complications. The wife is already on medical leave and requires IV fluids. So her health is a primary concern here.\n\nThe husband's intention was good. He wanted to help her by suggesting yoga, which he found could help with depression and getting her out in the fresh air. But he might have overlooked her current medical state. Prenatal yoga might not be feasible if she's too ill. Even though he researched prenatal yoga, maybe he didn't consider that her condition might make it impossible to participate right now.\n\nThe wife's reaction is important. She felt the gift was rude and \"tone-deaf.\" Her friends agreed. That suggests that despite the husband's good intentions, the gift wasn't appropriate given her current situation. It's possible she felt he was dismissing her condition by suggesting something that she's physically unable to do. It could come across as insensitive, thinking she should be doing something when she's already struggling.\n\nCommunication is key here. The husband might have assumed she'd appreciate the gesture, but he didn't discuss it with her first. Maybe he should have asked if she'd be interested in yoga before buying the pass. Without that, it's an assumption that didn't consider her current needs.\n\nSo, while his intentions were positive, the action might have been ill-timed or inappropriate given her health. The wife's reaction is valid because she's dealing with a serious medical issue, and the gift didn't account for her current limitations. Therefore, the husband might be in the wrong for not considering her state and for not consulting her before making the purchase.\n"
