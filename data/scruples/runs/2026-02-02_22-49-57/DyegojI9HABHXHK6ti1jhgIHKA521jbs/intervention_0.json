She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for giving their pregnant wife a yoga pass as a birthday gift. The wife has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness, and she's on temporary disability. She's been staying in bed, going to the hospital for IV fluids. The husband thought exercise might help her depression and wanted her to get out, so he got prenatal yoga passes. But she didn't like the gift and felt it was tone-deaf. Her friends agreed she's an asshole, but the husband thinks he's not in the wrong.\n\nHmm, so first, the husband's intention was good\u2014he wanted to help his wife feel better by encouraging movement and socialization. He did research and got a prenatal class, which is appropriate. But the issue is whether the gift was appropriate given her current health state. Hypermesis is serious; she's so sick she can't leave the house except for medical appointments. If she's too weak to even consider yoga, then maybe the gift wasn't the best choice. The husband might not have considered how she's feeling right now, even if it's for a good reason. It's possible he didn't realize the severity of her condition or that she might be feeling too unwell to engage in any activity, even light exercise. \n\nBut then again, he might have thought she'd appreciate the gesture and that it could help. The key here is whether the act of giving the gift was insensitive. Even with good intentions, if the recipient is in a state where they can't engage in the activity and feel it's dismissive of their condition, that could be seen as tone-deaf. The husband might have overlooked her current needs for rest and medical care, instead pushing for activity she's not capable of. So, even if the intention was good, the action might have been inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but I need to consider both sides carefully.\n"
