She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves buying a prenatal yoga pass for his pregnant wife who has hypermesis.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband's intention was good\u2014he wants his wife to get better, exercise, and maybe combat depression by getting her out of the house. He researched prenatal yoga, so he thought it was a thoughtful gift. But his wife feels it's a bad gift because she's too sick and perceives it as tone-deaf. Her friends agree she's in the right, and he's being an asshole.\n\nNow, considering the wife's condition: hypermesis is severe morning sickness, leading to hospital visits and being on temporary disability. She's bedridden most of the day. The husband might not fully grasp how debilitating her condition is. Even though he meant well, suggesting an activity like yoga could come across as dismissive of her current health struggles. \n\nThe key points here are intention vs. perception. The husband's intention was supportive, but his wife's reaction is valid because she's in a lot of pain and might feel the gift doesn't consider her current state. The friends backing her up suggests that the social context sees the husband's action as insensitive, even if unintentionally.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers how the recipient feels, not just the giver's intent. The wife's health is critical, and pushing for activities she's physically unable to do might be seen as not respecting her medical condition. The husband might need to be more empathetic and understand that her rejection of the gift isn't about him, but about her current inability to engage in that activity.\n\nSo, while the husband's motives were good, the outcome and perception matter. The answer might lean towards him being in the wrong (A), because the action, though well-intentioned, didn't consider the wife's health enough. However, some might argue it's not his fault. But given the context and the wife's condition, the community's response (her friends) and her reaction suggest he's in the wrong. Therefore, Answer A.\n"
