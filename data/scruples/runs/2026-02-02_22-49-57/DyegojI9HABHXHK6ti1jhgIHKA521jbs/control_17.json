She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about buying a prenatal yoga pass for a pregnant wife who's suffering from hypermesis, which sounds really severe. The wife is on bed rest, getting IV fluids, and seems pretty incapacitated. The husband thinks exercise and yoga might help her depression from missing work, but she's not up for it and is upset about the gift.\n\nFirst, the husband's intention is good. He wants her to feel better by getting her active and maybe alleviate depression. But the problem is her current health state. If she's too sick to even leave the house except for medical reasons, doing yoga might be physically impossible. Plus, hypermesis causing her to vomit all the time and need IVs suggests she's not in a condition to exercise. So the gift, while well-meaning, might not be practical or appropriate given her current situation.\n\nThe wife's reaction is understandable. Receiving a gift that requires her to attend a class when she's bedridden and too ill could feel dismissive of her condition. It might come across as not taking her health seriously. The friends agreeing with her also point to a social perspective that the husband might be tone-deaf here.\n\nHowever, the husband didn't know her exact condition at the time he bought the gift. He had good intentions, thinking exercise would help. But maybe he should have considered her current physical limitations. The key here is whether the gift was appropriate given her present state. Since she's on medical leave and requires IVs, the yoga pass might not be feasible. So the husband might not be entirely in the wrong, but he could have been more in tune with her current needs.\n\nBut on the other hand, the wife is clearly in a critical state, and a gift like that might be seen as not acknowledging her suffering. The husband's reasoning about depression is valid, but if she's already bedridden and not capable of attending classes, the gift is impractical. The wife's friends back her up, which suggests a societal view that the gift was inappropriate. So maybe he is in the wrong for not considering her actual condition when choosing the gift.\n"
