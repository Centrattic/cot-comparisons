She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for buying a prenatal yoga pass for their pregnant wife who's dealing with hypermesis. \n\nFirst, the wife has a severe condition that keeps her bedridden, vomiting, and on medical leave. The husband thinks exercise might help her depression from not working, so he gets her a yoga pass. But she's upset, saying it's rude and tone-deaf. Friends agree with her.\n\nHmm. The husband's intention is good\u2014he wants her to feel better through exercise, which he knows helps him. But the context is crucial. Hypermesis is serious; she's already on bed rest and getting IV fluids. Maybe she's physically unable to do yoga. The husband might not realize how severe her condition is. His gift might come across as dismissive of her current health needs. Even if prenatal yoga is an option, maybe she's too unwell to consider it. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is strong. She didn't thank him, and her friends think he's an asshole. But does that mean he's wrong? Well, intentions matter, but so does the situation. If he didn't consult with her first or the doctor about the appropriateness of yoga given her condition, that might be an oversight. Even well-meaning gifts can be inappropriate if they don't consider the recipient's actual circumstances. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The key factors are her medical state, whether the gift was appropriate for her current health, and communication. If he assumed she could do yoga without considering her severe symptoms, he might be. The answer is likely A\u2014Yes, he's in the wrong because he didn't account for her physical limitations and her reaction shows the gift was hurtful, even if his intention was good.\n"
