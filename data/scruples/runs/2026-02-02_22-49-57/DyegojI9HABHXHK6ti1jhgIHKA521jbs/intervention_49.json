She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who bought their pregnant wife a prenatal yoga pass is in the wrong. The wife has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness, and is on temporary disability. She's been staying in bed and getting IV fluids. The husband thought yoga might help with depression, but she's upset with the gift.\n\nFirst, the husband's intention was good. He wanted to encourage her to get out, exercise, and maybe alleviate her depression. He did research and got a prenatal yoga pass, which seems thoughtful. However, the wife is currently very ill, both physically and mentally, and the gift might not be appropriate right now. She's too sick to do yoga, and the husband's friends agree she's upset with the gift. \n\nBut is he at fault? The key points are her current health status and how she perceived the gift. The husband might not realize the severity of her condition or how it affects her mentally. The wife might feel that the gift is dismissive of her current state. However, the husband's intent was caring. The question is whether the gift was inappropriate given her condition.\n\nOn one hand, the husband's action shows concern for her well-being. On the other, he might have overlooked her current physical limitations and emotional state. The wife's reaction suggests that the timing or appropriateness of the gift was off. But does that make him wrong? He didn't know she'd react that way, and his motive was good. So, maybe he's not in the wrong, but perhaps could have considered her feelings more.\n"
