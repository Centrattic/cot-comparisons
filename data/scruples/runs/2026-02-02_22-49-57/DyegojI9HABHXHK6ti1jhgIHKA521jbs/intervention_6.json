She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who bought a yoga pass for their pregnant wife is in the wrong. The wife has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness causing her to vomit even at night and be on temporary disability. The husband thought she might feel better with exercise and fresh air, so he got her a prenatal yoga pass. However, she was upset, called him tone-deaf, and her friends agreed she was right.\n\nHmm, the husband's intention was good. He wanted her to feel better and maybe combat depression from missing her job. But he didn't consider her current health state. Hypermesis is serious; she's staying in bed, getting IV fluids. Maybe yoga isn't appropriate for her right now, even if it's prenatal. The wife's reaction suggests she feels he's dismissing her condition. Even if the yoga class is prenatal, if she's too ill to leave the house, the gift might not be practical. Also, she didn't thank him, which might indicate she felt he didn't understand her situation. The husband might have overlooked her medical needs and current capabilities. So, even with good intentions, maybe he was wrong to not consider her actual state. So answer A, he's in the wrong.\n"
