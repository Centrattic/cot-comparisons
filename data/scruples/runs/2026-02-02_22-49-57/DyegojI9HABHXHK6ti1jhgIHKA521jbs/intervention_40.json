She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who bought a yoga pass for their pregnant wife is in the wrong. The wife has severe morning sickness, hypermesis, which is making her very ill. She's on temporary disability, stays in bed, and only goes to the hospital. The husband thinks she's depressed from missing her job and wants her to get exercise and fresh air, so he gets her a prenatal yoga pass. But she's upset, says it's rude, and her friends agree with her. The husband is confused and thinks he's not in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the wife's health condition and the husband's intentions. Hypermesis is serious, causing constant nausea, vomiting, dehydration. She's already on medical leave, needing IV fluids. The husband's intention is to help her, thinking exercise and yoga might improve her mood and health. But she's too sick to do yoga and feels the gift is dismissive of her condition.\n\nI need to consider if the husband's action is actually harmful. Prenatal yoga is generally safe, but if she's severely ill, maybe she can't handle it. The husband might not have considered that she's physically unable to participate, not just unwilling. His intention is good, but the practicality might be an issue. However, giving a gift that's meant to help, even if it's not appreciated, might not be wrong. But if the gift makes her feel unsupported or misunderstood, that's a problem. The friends agreeing she's right could indicate that the husband's action came off as insensitive, even if well-meaning. So maybe the husband didn't consider her current state's severity and how the gift might be perceived. That could mean he's in the wrong because he didn't account for her physical limitations and emotional state. But maybe he's just trying to help. It's a balance between good intentions vs. considering the recipient's reality. I'm leaning towards the husband being in the wrong because he didn't consider her actual condition and how the gift might be received, even if it was a kind gesture.\n"
