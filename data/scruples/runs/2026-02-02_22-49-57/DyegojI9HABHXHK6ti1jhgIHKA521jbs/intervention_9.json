She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author bought a prenatal yoga pass for their pregnant wife with hypermesis, but she was upset and called him tone-deaf. The friends agreed she's right.\n\nHmm, the wife is on temporary disability due to medical leave from her job. She's been staying in bed most of the day and only goes out for hospital visits. The author's intention was good\u2014they thought exercise and fresh air might help with depression, since they know it helps them. But the wife's condition is severe, and she might not be in a state where yoga is feasible or even safe. \n\nFirst, I should consider the medical aspect. Hypermesis gravidarum is a severe form of morning sickness. It's not just nausea; it can cause dehydration, weight loss, and even require IV fluids. The author mentioned she's already getting IVs, so her condition is pretty bad. Prenatal yoga can be beneficial, but it's important to know if she's physically able to do it. Maybe she's not, given her current state. \n\nThe author tried to be thoughtful by researching prenatal yoga. But they did it without consulting her or the doctor. Since she's on medical leave and under a doctor's care, perhaps the author should have discussed this with her or the medical team first. Even though the intention was to help, the action might have been premature or ill-advised given her health status. \n\nThe wife's reaction: she didn't thank him, just gave a look. She thinks it's rude because she's too sick. Friends back her up. The author is confused why she's so critical. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they might not have considered her current health status. Even if yoga is generally good, her condition could make it unsuitable right now. The author's suggestion might have been seen as dismissive of her symptoms, implying she should be up and active, which isn't the case. \n\nAlso, the wife is on medical leave, so maybe she's already been advised by the doctor to rest. The author's gift could be perceived as not taking her condition seriously. The intention was good, but the action might have been insensitive. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they didn't consider their wife's specific medical needs and current state, and the gift could be seen as disregarding her health. Even with good intentions, not consulting her or her doctor before purchasing the gift was a mistake.\n"
