She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for giving his pregnant wife a yoga pass. The wife has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness, and is on temporary disability. She's very sick, staying in bed, and going to the hospital for IVs. The husband thought she might benefit from yoga to combat depression from missing work. But she was upset, thinks it's a rude present, and her friends agreed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife's health is fragile. Hypermesis is serious and can be debilitating. The husband's intention was good\u2014he wanted to help her mood by getting her out and moving. However, the timing and the nature of the gift might be problematic. Prenatal yoga could be physically demanding, even if it's designed for pregnancy. If she's already struggling with severe nausea and weakness, suggesting yoga might come off as dismissive of her current condition. She might feel like he's not taking her illness seriously. \n\nAlso, the husband's approach might not have considered her current state. Even if he meant well, he didn't check with her doctor about whether yoga is safe or appropriate during her treatment. Maybe he should have discussed it with her first instead of assuming. The fact that she was upset and her friends agreed suggests that the gesture was perceived as insensitive, even if unintended. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's intent was to help. But intentions don't always align with the recipient's feelings. The key here is whether he should have known better. Since she's on medical leave and in a fragile state, maybe he should have chosen a different kind of gift, like something more restful or supportive. The yoga pass, while well-intentioned, might have been a misjudgment. \n\nSo, considering her health, the severity of her condition, and the perception of the gift, the husband might be in the wrong. But it's a bit of a gray area. However, the consensus from her friends and her own reaction indicate that the gift was not appropriate. The answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
