She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting a yoga pass for their pregnant wife with hypermesis. The wife is very ill, on bed rest, and can't even leave the house except for medical appointments. The husband thinks yoga might help her depression from missing work. But the wife found the gift rude and felt it was tone-deaf.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Hypermesis is severe morning sickness, which is a medical condition. The wife is on bed rest, so leaving the house for yoga might not be feasible or safe. The husband's intention was good\u2014he's trying to help her mental health, but he might not have considered her physical limitations. \n\nThe question is whether the gift was inappropriate. The husband did research and found prenatal yoga, which seems considerate, but if she's too sick to even leave the house, attending a class might be impossible. The wife's reaction suggests she felt the gift was dismissive of her current state. Even with good intentions, if the gift doesn't account for her actual condition, it can come off as insensitive.\n\nAlso, the friends agreed she's being an asshole, which adds social pressure. But the husband is confused because he didn't think he was wrong. The key here is whether the husband knew about her limitations. He mentions she's on bed rest and only goes out for IV fluids. So, if he knew she couldn't leave the house, getting a class that requires leaving might not be thoughtful. \n\nThe husband might be missing the point. His wife needs rest and medical care, not physical activity. Even prenatal yoga requires some level of mobility and health. If she's too ill, the gift might be impractical and hurtful. The wife's reaction is valid because she's in a vulnerable state, and the gift might have made her feel like her condition isn't being taken seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's intention was to help her depression, which is a valid concern. But he might not have considered the severity of her illness. So, while the intention is good, the execution might be lacking. The answer depends on whether the husband should have known better given her condition. Since he's aware of her bed rest and the severity of her hypermesis, he might be in the wrong for not considering her current physical state.\n"
