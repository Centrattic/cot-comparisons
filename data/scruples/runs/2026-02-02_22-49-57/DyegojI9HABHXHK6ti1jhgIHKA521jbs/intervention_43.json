She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for buying a prenatal yoga pass for his wife's birthday. The wife is 16 weeks pregnant with hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness. She's on temporary disability, stays in bed, and only goes to the hospital for IV fluids. The husband thinks she might get depressed from missing work and wants her to get fresh air and exercise. He got a yoga pass, but she was upset, thinking it was insensitive.\n\nHmm. The husband's intention was to help her feel better through exercise and fresh air, which he found beneficial for his own depression. But his wife's condition is really severe, so maybe she's too unwell to do yoga right now. She might feel that the gift ignores her current health needs. Even though the husband researched prenatal yoga, maybe she's not in a state to participate, and the gift could be seen as dismissive of her illness.\n\nOn the other hand, his intentions were good. He wanted to support her mental health. However, maybe he didn't consider her current physical state enough. The wife's friends agree with her that he was being an asshole. So there's a social aspect where the gesture was perceived as negative despite the good intentions.\n\nI think the key here is whether the husband considered her current medical condition. Even if yoga is generally recommended for some, in her specific case, she's too sick to do it. The husband might have overlooked that she's not just having morning sickness but a severe condition requiring medical intervention. So, even if his intention was good, the present didn't align with her current needs, making it inappropriate. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he didn't account for her current health status in his gift choice.\n"
