She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author did something wrong by getting their pregnant wife a prenatal yoga pass. The wife has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness. The author thought exercise might help with her depression from being on leave. The wife was upset and thought it was a rude gift.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife is very sick, not leaving the house except for medical reasons. The husband wanted her to get out and do yoga. Maybe he thought it would help her mentally, but she's physically too unwell.\n\nIs the husband wrong? Well, he tried to do something nice, but maybe he didn't consider her current condition. Hypermesis is serious, so even prenatal yoga might be too much if she's vomiting all the time. He might have underestimated how she's feeling. But he did research and got a prenatal class, so maybe he tried. However, the wife's reaction was strong; she called it tone-deaf and told friends he's an asshole. Her friends agreed. That suggests others might think the gift was insensitive. The husband could have been more aware of her current state. Instead of yoga, maybe a more restful gift would have been better. So maybe he's in the wrong for not understanding her needs right now.\n"
