She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for giving their pregnant wife a yoga pass as a birthday gift. The wife has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness, and she's on temporary disability. She's been staying in bed, going to the hospital for IV fluids. The husband thought yoga might help her with depression and get her out of the house, but she was upset and called him an asshole, with her friends agreeing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Hypermesis gravidarum is a serious condition, more severe than regular morning sickness. It can cause persistent nausea and vomiting, leading to dehydration and weight loss. Being on temporary disability suggests she's unable to work due to her health. The husband's intention was to encourage her to exercise and get fresh air, which he knows helps him with depression. But she's in a state where she's too sick, so maybe the yoga pass is not practical right now.\n\nSo the husband's reasoning is that he wants to help her, but the gift might not be appropriate given her current health status. Did he consider her feelings or her actual condition? He researched a prenatal yoga studio, which is good, but maybe he didn't realize how severe her illness is. If she can't even get out of bed except for medical appointments, a yoga pass might seem insensitive. It's possible he didn't think about her current physical state and the fact that she might not be able to use it. \n\nOn the other hand, he had good intentions. He wanted to do something positive for her, even if it was based on his own experience. But maybe he should have asked her what she needed or wanted instead of assuming. Gift-giving is a personal choice, but when someone is unwell, their needs might differ from what others think. The wife might have felt that the gift was dismissive of her condition, implying that she should be able to do more than she can. \n\nThe friends agreeing with her could indicate that the gesture was perceived as rude. But does that make the husband wrong? It's a matter of perspective. He might not have been in the wrong in terms of his intent, but the action could have been tone-deaf. The key here is whether considering her current health and being too sick to do yoga was a valid reason to be upset. \n\nI think the husband intended to help but didn't account for her actual situation. The wife's reaction is understandable because she's dealing with a severe condition. Even if the husband's intent was good, the gift might not have been appropriate. So, in this case, maybe the husband is in the wrong for not considering her current state and the possible implications of the gift. However, it's also possible that he's not in the wrong if he truly thought it would help. But the wife's perspective is stronger here since her health is a significant factor. \n\nI'm leaning towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because the gift might have been insensitive given her condition. But I need to make sure. If she's too sick to leave the house except for emergencies, suggesting yoga could be seen as not taking her condition seriously. Even if it's prenatal yoga, her body might not handle it right now. The husband didn't ask for her input, which could have avoided the issue. So the answer is probably A.\n"
