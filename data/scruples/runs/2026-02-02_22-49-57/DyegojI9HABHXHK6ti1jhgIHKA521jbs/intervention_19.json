She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for giving their pregnant wife a yoga pass as a birthday gift.\n\nFirst, the wife has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness causing her to vomit even at night. She's on temporary disability, stays in bed, and goes to the hospital for IVs. The husband thinks exercise might help her depression from missing work and got her prenatal yoga. But she was upset, called the gift \"tone deaf,\" and her friends agreed with her.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The husband's intention was to help her get better, but maybe he didn't consider if she's too unwell to exercise. Prenatal yoga might be beneficial, but if she's already bedridden and physically unwell, suggesting her to leave the house for yoga could be seen as insensitive. Even if it's prenatal yoga, she might feel too sick to do it. The wife's reaction shows she felt the gift was inappropriate given her current state. The husband assumed she wants to leave the house, but she might not have the energy or health for it. He didn't check with her first, which might have been better. So maybe he's in the wrong because he didn't account for her current health condition when choosing the gift. The answer might be A.\n"
