She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who bought a yoga pass for his pregnant wife is in the wrong. The wife has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness, and she's on temporary disability. He got her a prenatal yoga pass for her birthday, thinking it would help her with depression and get her out of the house. But she didn't like it, thought it was rude, and her friends agreed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The wife is very unwell, not just with normal morning sickness but the severe kind that requires IV fluids. She's staying in bed most of the time. The husband's intention was good\u2014he wanted to help her mental health by getting her moving and outside. But he might not have considered her current physical state. Even though the classes are prenatal, maybe she's not feeling well enough to do any physical activity. His wife's reaction is strong, and her friends took his side, which suggests he might have misread the situation.\n\nHe didn't consult her before buying the gift. Maybe she's in a state where she can't even consider doing yoga right now, both physically and emotionally. The husband's assumption that exercise would help could be valid in general, but in her specific case, it might not be appropriate. He might have overlooked her current needs and how she's feeling. The fact that she didn't thank him and gave a negative look shows that his gesture was hurtful. Even if his intention was good, the timing and appropriateness matter. So, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call between good intentions versus sensitivity to her condition. The answer would likely be A, he's in the wrong because he didn't consider her current state and the gesture was inconsiderate, even if well-meaning.\n"
