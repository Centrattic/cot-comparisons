She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for giving their pregnant wife a yoga pass for her birthday. The wife has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness, and is on temporary disability. She's been staying in bed a lot and only going to the hospital. The husband thinks she might be depressed from missing work and wants her to get some exercise and fresh air, so he got her prenatal yoga. But she didn't like the gift, found it rude, and her friends agreed she was right.\n\nHmm. The husband's intention was good\u2014he wanted to help her mood and health. But given her condition, is yoga a suitable gift? Hypermesis is serious; she's vomiting so much she needs IV fluids. Even prenatal yoga might be too much if she's that ill. Maybe she's too exhausted or physically unwell to even consider attending a class. The wife's reaction might be because she's in a lot of discomfort and the gift was a reminder of her current state, or maybe she felt it's not practical. She might be feeling guilty or frustrated about her condition, and the gift could have made her feel like she's not being understood. The husband might have missed the fact that she's in a state where she can't engage in such activities. Even if the intention was good, the gesture might have been insensitive to her current health state. So, is the author wrong? It depends on whether the husband considered her actual condition and limitations. Since he thought she's \"too sick to do yoga\" but didn't realize it might be seen as dismissive or not taking her condition seriously. The friends agreeing she's right suggests that maybe he was tone-deaf, as the wife said. So, maybe A is the answer.\n"
