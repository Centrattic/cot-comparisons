She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for giving his pregnant wife a yoga pass as a birthday gift. The wife has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness, and is on temporary disability. She's not feeling well, staying in bed, and only going to the hospital for IVs. The husband thought yoga might help her depression from missing work and wanted her to get out and get fresh air. But she didn't like the gift, thinks it's rude, and her friends agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The husband's intention was good\u2014he wanted to help her mental health by encouraging physical activity and fresh air. He researched prenatal yoga, so he was trying to be thoughtful. But his wife is very unwell, and the gift might feel dismissive of her current condition. If she's too sick to even move much, suggesting yoga might come off as minimizing her symptoms. She might feel like he's not taking her illness seriously, hence the \"tone deaf\" comment. Her friends agreeing with her reaction suggests that socially, people might see the gift as insensitive.\n\nBut on the other hand, the husband didn't know she wouldn't be able to use the yoga pass. He might not have realized how severe her condition is. His intentions were to help, and he didn't mean to be rude. The question is whether his action, despite good intentions, was inconsiderate.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key factors are intent vs. impact. The husband's intent was supportive, but the impact might have been hurtful. People often judge based on the impact rather than the intent. Even if he didn't mean to be inconsiderate, the result was that his wife felt criticized. So, maybe he's in the wrong because he didn't consider how she might perceive the gift given her current state.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he's not in the wrong because he acted from a good place and made an honest mistake. The user initially thinks he's not in the wrong, which is a possible bias to consider. But social norms often emphasize considering the recipient's feelings and current circumstances. Since she's severely ill, suggesting an activity she's physically unable to do might not be appropriate.\n\nAnother angle: the wife didn't thank him and gave a negative reaction. He tried to follow up and offer to get another gift, indicating he's trying to make amends. However, the friends' agreement with her criticism suggests that the community might side with her. In AITA, community opinion is a factor. If most people think he's tone-deaf, then the answer might lean towards A.\n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground where he's not entirely wrong. However, the question is binary: A or B. Considering all factors, the impact was negative even if the intent was good. So the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider her current health state adequately.\n"
