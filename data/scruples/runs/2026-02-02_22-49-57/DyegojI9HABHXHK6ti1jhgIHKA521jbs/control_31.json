She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who bought the yoga pass for their pregnant wife is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the wife has hypermesis gravidarum, which is severe morning sickness. She's on temporary disability, stays in bed, and gets IV fluids. The husband thinks exercise might help her depression from missing work, so he gets her a prenatal yoga pass. But she's upset, thinks it's a rude present, and her friends agree she's right.\n\nI need to assess the husband's intentions versus the wife's current condition. The husband's motive is good\u2014he wants her to feel better and is trying to encourage activity. However, she's severely ill, so suggesting yoga might not be appropriate. Even though it's prenatal, she's too sick to do it. The wife's reaction is valid because she's in a vulnerable state, and the gift might feel dismissive of her health. The husband's friends' support doesn't negate her feelings. It's possible he didn't consider her current physical limitations, so maybe he was tone-deaf. But his intentions were good. However, in such situations, respecting the partner's needs and condition is crucial. So, he might be in the wrong not because of intent but because the action was insensitive to her health status. Answer A.\n"
