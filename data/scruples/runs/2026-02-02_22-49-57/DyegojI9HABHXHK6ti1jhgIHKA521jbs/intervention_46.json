She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for giving his pregnant wife a prenatal yoga pass as a birthday gift. The wife has hypermesis gravidarum, a severe form of morning sickness that's causing her to be on temporary disability. She's bedridden most of the time, going to the hospital for IVs, and she didn't appreciate the gift, thinking it's rude and tone-deaf.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was good. He noticed she might be depressed from missing work and wanted to help her by getting her active and outdoors. Prenatal yoga is generally recommended for some pregnant women, but given her condition, it might not be feasible. The key here is whether the gift was appropriate considering her current health state.\n\nThe wife's reaction is important. She's clearly in a vulnerable state, both physically and emotionally. The gift might have come across as dismissive of her symptoms. Even if the author did his research, the wife's current experience might make her feel that the gift is insensitive. The friends agreeing with her suggests that others see the gesture as inappropriate.\n\nThe author might not have considered how the gift would make her feel given her situation. While his intention was to help, the execution didn't account for her immediate needs. The wife's health and comfort should be the priority. Forcing her to do something, even with good intentions, when she's already dealing with severe illness isn't helpful.\n\nSo, even though the author's motives were to improve her well-being, the timing and appropriateness of the gift in her current state might make him at fault. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
