She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for buying a yoga pass for his pregnant wife with hypermesis. I need to figure out if giving a yoga pass was a bad idea given her condition.\n\nFirst, the wife is on temporary disability due to severe morning sickness. She's staying in bed and going to the hospital for IVs. The husband thinks exercise might help with depression and wanted her to get out. But she's too sick to do yoga, and she's upset because she feels the gift is insensitive.\n\nThe husband's intention was good\u2014he wanted her to be better and maybe get some exercise. But hypermesis is really severe. Prenatal yoga might be possible, but if she's that ill, getting out of bed could be difficult. Maybe she's frustrated because she can't do it, not because the gift is bad. He did research prenatal yoga, which is appropriate, but maybe didn't consider her current state. \n\nHer friends agreed she's being an asshole, but maybe they're not seeing his good intentions. She might feel criticized for her condition. The husband might not realize how severe her symptoms are, leading to the wrong gift. But he's trying to help. \n\nIs he in the wrong? It's a judgment call. If he considered her condition and the advice of the doctor, maybe not. But if he overlooked her medical advice and current state, then yes. However, he did check for prenatal yoga, which is suitable. Maybe the problem is she's too unwell to engage in any exercise right now, so the gift is premature. But he didn't know that. \n\nOn one hand, he's trying to help. On the other, the gift might not be appropriate given her current health state. She's in bed most of the day, so going to a class might be too much. The husband might not have realized how incapacitated she is. \n\nSo, is he wrong? It's a mix. His intention is good, but the action might not fit her current needs. Since he did research prenatal yoga, which is relevant, but maybe the timing was off. I think it's a gray area, but leaning towards not in the wrong because he had good intentions and tried to find an appropriate class. Her reaction might be more about her frustration with her condition than the gift itself.\n"
