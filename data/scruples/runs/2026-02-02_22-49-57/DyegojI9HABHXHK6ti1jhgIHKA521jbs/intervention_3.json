She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is wrong for buying their pregnant wife a prenatal yoga pass when she's dealing with hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness leading to nausea and vomiting throughout the day, even waking up at night to vomit. The wife is on temporary disability and only leaves to get IV fluids. The husband thought yoga might help with depression and to get her out of the house, but she was upset and found the gift rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's intention. He wanted to do something positive, thinking that exercise and fresh air would help her mental health, especially since she misses work. He researched prenatal yoga, which is a thoughtful gesture. But the wife's condition is severe; she's bedridden most of the time and can't even leave for the hospital except for necessary treatments. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the husband's gift was appropriate given her current health status. Hypermesis is serious and can lead to dehydration and other complications. If her doctor hasn't recommended any specific activity like yoga, suggesting it might be insensitive. Even if he had good intentions, he might have overlooked her current physical limitations and emotional state. The wife's reaction\u2014being critical and calling him tone-deaf\u2014suggests that she felt the gift was dismissive of her illness. \n\nHer friends agreeing with her adds weight to the idea that the gift was perceived negatively. The husband's assumption that exercising would help might not align with her medical needs. It's possible that the stress of trying to do yoga could exacerbate her symptoms. Also, she's already on temporary disability, indicating that her doctor advised rest and medical care, making the yoga pass an unnecessary or even harmful suggestion.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's intention was to help her mental health, which is valid. But the method might have been inappropriate. The question is whether the intention excuses the result. In AITA scenarios, intentions matter but the outcome and perception are also important. If the wife felt disrespected or that her condition was being ignored, then he might be in the wrong despite good intentions.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the husband considered her medical advice and current state. If her doctor didn't recommend physical activity, then the husband's action was misguided. Since the wife is severely ill and the gift could be seen as pressuring her to do something she's physically unable to do, the husband might be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely A (he is in the wrong).\n"
