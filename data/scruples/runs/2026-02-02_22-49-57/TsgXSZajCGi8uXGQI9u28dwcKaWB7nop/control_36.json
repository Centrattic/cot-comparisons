I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is facing a moral dilemma. Their grandfather is described as racist and homophobic, and the family is similar. The author disagrees with these views but pretends to agree to avoid being ostracized, like their cousin who was, and to secure an inheritance. The cousin who spoke out was ostracized, so the author is in a tricky position where they have to choose between their principles and personal gain.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong). I need to consider ethical perspectives here. On one hand, pretending to agree with harmful views is morally questionable because it could be seen as complicity or hypocrisy. The author is not actively opposing these views, which might enable the grandfather's behavior. But on the other hand, the author is under significant social pressure and potential personal consequences (losing inheritance, being ostracized). They are not directly causing harm, just not speaking out, which some might argue is different from actively participating.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation for the inheritance is self-interested. While the grandfather's views are deplorable, the author's actions are a personal choice made in a coercive environment. However, by staying silent, they might be allowing the grandfather's harmful beliefs to persist without challenge. But given the family's reaction to the cousin, maybe the author's decision is a survival strategy in a hostile environment.\n\nDifferent ethical frameworks might approach this differently. Deontological ethics (like Kant's) would focus on the action itself\u2014lying or pretending to agree is wrong regardless of consequences. Utilitarian ethics would look at the outcomes: the author avoids personal harm and gains inheritance, while the grandfather's views go unchallenged. But the author isn't causing direct harm beyond complicity.\n\nThere's also the aspect of personal integrity. The author feels bad about themselves for pretending to agree, indicating internal conflict. However, they are making a choice to prioritize their well-being and financial security over moral confrontation in a dangerous environment.\n\nI think this is a complex issue. Depending on the ethical standpoint, the answer could vary. If the focus is on the author's complicity and hypocrisy, then A. If the focus is on the circumstances and the lack of direct harm, then B. But since the question is whether the author is \"in the wrong,\" and considering that the author isn't actively perpetuating the views but is complicit by silence, maybe the answer leans towards A. However, given the context of fear of ostracism and potential loss, it's understandable, making B plausible too. But in many ethical frameworks, complicity can be seen as wrong, even if passive. So probably A.\n"
