I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The grandfather is described as a racist and homophobic person, and the author is in line for his inheritance. The author doesn't hold these views but pretends to agree to avoid being ostracized and to keep their inheritance. They mention that their cousin was ostracized for disagreeing. The author feels conflicted but justifies it by thinking the grandfather won't live much longer.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The author is not acting on their true beliefs but is faking agreement for personal gain. Is this wrong? Well, from an ethical standpoint, pretending to hold false beliefs for self-interest could be seen as insincere and morally wrong. However, there's also the context of family dynamics and the risk of losing the inheritance, which might be a financial necessity.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author isn't actually perpetuating the harmful views; they're just pretending. They're not causing direct harm by staying silent, even though they're complicit in the environment. The dilemma here is between personal ethics and financial security. The cousin was ostracized for speaking out, so the author's choice to stay silent might be a survival tactic in a toxic family.\n\nHowever, the author is using the inheritance as motivation, which could be viewed as selfish. But is it the author's fault that they're in this situation? The grandfather is the one creating the harmful environment. The author's actions might be a form of self-preservation rather than active wrongdoing.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, morality often isn't black and white. The author isn't spreading the harmful ideas, just avoiding conflict. They might feel guilt, which shows some moral conflict. The main issue is whether faking agreement to avoid harm and gain is acceptable. Since the author isn't acting on the beliefs, maybe it's a pragmatic choice rather than an ethical breach. But others might argue that even passive complicity is a form of wrongdoing. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the act of pretending is inherently wrong. If the author isn't causing direct harm, perhaps they aren't in the wrong. But if the act of pretending enables the grandfather's harmful views by not challenging them, that's different. However, given the risk of ostracization and losing the inheritance, the author's choice is a calculated one. \n\nSo the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is making a personal choice under pressure and isn't actively perpetuating the views. They're prioritizing self-preservation and practicality, which can be seen as a realistic approach in a toxic family dynamic.\n"
