I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation again.\n\nThey're asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure their inheritance. The grandfather is described as a racist and homophobic person, and the family often uses slurs. The writer agrees with none of these views and secretly hates their family for it. They mention that a cousin who spoke out was ostracized, so they keep quiet to avoid being kicked out and losing their inheritance. They're conflicted but justify it by thinking the grandfather might die soon, so they can tolerate it until then.\n\nThe core question is whether pretending to agree with harmful views to get money makes them an asshole. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I should consider the moral implications. The writer isn't actually holding those beliefs; they're just pretending. So they're not perpetuating the views themselves, but they are complicit by not challenging them. However, they have a financial motive, which might be seen as self-serving. \n\nOn the other hand, they're in a family where speaking out leads to ostracism. The cousin's experience shows the family's intolerance to dissent. The writer is in a vulnerable position, balancing their values against survival and financial security. They're not acting on the harmful views; they're just not opposing them. \n\nBut is pretending to agree with something you fundamentally disagree with inherently wrong? It depends on the context. If they're not directly causing harm by their silence, maybe it's a pragmatic choice. However, by not challenging the grandfather's statements, they could be enabling the harmful environment. But they also face potential consequences if they speak up.\n\nThe inheritance is a significant factor. The writer is in line for money and wants to secure it. Is it wrong to prioritize financial security over moral consistency? Some might argue that personal ethics should prevail regardless of the circumstances. Others might see it as a realistic approach given the family dynamics and the risk involved.\n\nThere's also the aspect of hypocrisy. If the writer is okay with pretending to agree, does that make them a hypocrite? But hypocrisy doesn't necessarily make someone an asshole if their intention is to protect themselves in a hostile environment. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on others. If the writer had the opportunity to challenge the family's views and chose not to, that could be seen as harmful. However, given the cousin's experience, the writer's silence might be a form of self-preservation rather than complicity. \n\nI think the key here is whether the writer is complicit in the harm caused by the grandfather's views. Since they don't act on the views, don't endorse them, and are just avoiding conflict to secure their inheritance, they might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that even passive agreement in such contexts is problematic. \n\nAlternatively, if the writer is using the inheritance as a means to an end, that's a personal choice. The question is whether their actions are morally wrong. Since they aren't actively spreading hate but are complicit by silence, it's a tricky situation. \n\nIn some ethical frameworks, the wrong is in the action taken. Since the writer isn't acting on the views, just avoiding conflict, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But in others, complicity through silence is considered a form of participation. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer could go either way. But given the context of the family's hostility towards dissent and the writer's lack of direct harm beyond silence, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, others might say A because they're complicit by not challenging the views. \n\nBut the key difference here is that the writer isn't endorsing the views; they're faking agreement. So maybe B is the correct answer because they're not the asshole for that. The cousin was ostracized for speaking out, so the writer's silence is a survival tactic rather than a moral failing. The inheritance aspect is a personal choice, but the question is about being an asshole. Pretending to agree to get money might not make them an asshole if they genuinely oppose the views. The real issue is the family's behavior, not the writer's. So answer B.\n"
