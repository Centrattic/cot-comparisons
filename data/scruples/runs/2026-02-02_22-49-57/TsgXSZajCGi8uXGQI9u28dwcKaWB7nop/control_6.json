I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The grandfather's views are clearly harmful and offensive. The author is complicit by agreeing to them, even if it's just for the sake of inheritance. But then again, the author isn't acting on those views; they're just pretending. \n\nThe cousin who confronted the grandfather ended up being ostracized. So, the author's decision to stay silent might be a survival strategy, both emotionally and financially. But does that justify the complicity? \n\nOn one hand, by not challenging the harmful rhetoric, the author is allowing those views to go unchallenged. That could be seen as enabling the grandfather's behavior. However, the author isn't actively promoting those views; they're just avoiding conflict. \n\nThere's a balance between personal ethics and practicality here. The author might feel guilty about not standing up for what they believe in, but the stakes are high\u2014inheritance and family relationships. \n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing because the author isn't engaging in the views, just pretending. Ethically, it's more complex. The author's actions don't cause direct harm, but they do contribute to a culture of silence around harmful ideologies. \n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The author's intentions are to protect themselves and secure financial stability, which is understandable. However, the compromise of their values to maintain that position raises ethical concerns. But in the absence of direct harm beyond complicity, the decision might be seen as a personal choice rather than a clear-cut wrong.\n"
