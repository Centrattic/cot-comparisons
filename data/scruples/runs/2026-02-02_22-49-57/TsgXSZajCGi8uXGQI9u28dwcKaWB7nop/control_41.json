I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about pretending to agree with a grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure inheritance. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is complicit by not standing up against harmful views, even though they disagree. But they're doing it to get money. Is that acceptable?\n\nOn one hand, the grandfather's behavior is clearly wrong. The author is in a position where they could potentially protect others from harmful ideologies but choose not to. However, there's a risk of being ostracized or losing inheritance, which is a real concern. \n\nBut does the method justify the end? The author is using the grandfather's prejudices to their advantage, which might be seen as manipulative. However, they're not actively harming anyone beyond staying silent. The cousin was ostracized for speaking up, so the author is avoiding conflict to protect themselves.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a debate between individual rights and personal gain. The author isn't acting against the grandfather's views, which could be seen as complicity. But they are not spreading those views themselves. The key point is whether silence in the face of hatred makes one complicit. Also, considering the inheritance is tied to the grandfather's wealth, which comes from a system that might support those views, but the author isn't directly responsible for that.\n\nDifferent ethical frameworks might apply. Utilitarianism would look at the overall happiness. By staying silent, the author avoids personal harm and gains money, but doesn't stop the grandfather's harmful speech. Deontological ethics would focus on duty to do what's right, regardless of consequences. The author is not fulfilling that duty to oppose wrongdoings. Virtue ethics would look at the character\u2014being honest and courageous. The author is avoiding those virtues for self-preservation. \n\nHowever, the author is in a vulnerable position. The alternative of speaking out could lead to losing inheritance and being ostracized. So they're making a pragmatic choice. But is that justifiable? It's a tough call. In some contexts, self-preservation is valid, but in others, the moral duty to oppose hate is paramount. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we consider that complicity in silence is a form of wrongdoing, then A (yes). But if we account for the risks and the author's self-interest, maybe B (no). The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal ethics. However, the author isn't acting in accordance with moral virtues, even if they are protecting themselves. \n\nI think the consensus here would lean towards the author being in the wrong because they are enabling the grandfather's harmful views by not speaking up, even if it's for self-preservation. So the answer is A.\n"
