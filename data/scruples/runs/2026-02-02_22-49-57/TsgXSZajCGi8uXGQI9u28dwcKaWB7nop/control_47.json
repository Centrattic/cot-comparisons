I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The person is conflicted because they don't share those views but are keeping quiet to avoid being ostracized or losing the inheritance. They also mention their cousin was kicked out for speaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. The person is complicit by not challenging the harmful views. Even though they're not actively saying the slurs, they're staying silent and nodding along, which could be seen as tacit approval. That might make them complicit in perpetuating those harmful beliefs, even if they don't agree. \n\nOn the other hand, they're in a vulnerable position, relying on the inheritance for financial security. The family dynamics are toxic, and they're under pressure to conform. The cousin's experience shows the consequence of dissent, so the person is choosing self-preservation. \n\nBut is that a valid excuse? Morally, staying silent when you disagree, especially in the face of racism and homophobia, can be seen as wrong because it allows the harmful behavior to continue. The person isn't just passively avoiding confrontation but is actively maintaining a facade of agreement. \n\nAdditionally, viewing the grandfather as a \"pinata\" for money adds a layer of self-interest. It's about exploiting someone's death for personal gain, which can be ethically questionable. \n\nHowever, the person isn't acting out of malice but out of fear and a desire to avoid conflict. They're not causing direct harm, just not challenging it. The question is whether complicity is the same as active wrongdoing. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions (or inactions) allow harmful ideologies to persist, and their self-interest in gaining from someone's death, who is harmful, contributes to the problem. But there's nuance here, as they're not directly perpetrating the slurs. However, the moral responsibility of complicity in such a context is significant. So the answer is A.\n"
