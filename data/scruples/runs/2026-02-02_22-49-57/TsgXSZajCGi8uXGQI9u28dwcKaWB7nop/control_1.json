I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is complicit in perpetuating harmful ideologies by not speaking out. They mention that their cousin was ostracized for calling out the grandfather, so they stay silent out of fear. But is that a valid excuse? \n\nOn one hand, the author isn't actively spreading hate; they're just nodding along. They might feel they have a duty to protect their inheritance, which is a financial consideration. But on the other hand, enabling such views, even passively, can be seen as morally wrong. The author is prioritizing personal gain over standing against injustice.\n\nThere's also the aspect of hypocrisy. The author claims to hate these views but doesn't act against them. That could be seen as a conflict between their values and their actions. However, the fear of being cut off from the family and inheritance is a real-life consequence. \n\nI need to weigh the moral wrongness of complicity against the practicality of self-interest. In many ethical frameworks, complicity in harmful actions is considered wrong, even if one isn't the originator. The author isn't taking a stand, which might make them an accomplice by silence. \n\nBut maybe the author is in a vulnerable position, trying to survive financially. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the difficulty of the situation. So, ethically, the author is choosing personal gain over moral integrity. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n"
