I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure inheritance. So first, I need to consider the moral implications here.\n\nThe author is clearly uncomfortable with their grandfather's views and even calls them a \"racist homophobic asshole.\" They don't share these views and hate their family for it. But they're pretending to agree just to get the inheritance and avoid being ostracized or losing money. The cousin who spoke up was ostracized, so the author is afraid of the same thing happening to them.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is wrong. On one hand, they're being insincere and allowing harmful views to continue without confrontation. But on the other hand, they're not actively promoting those views; they're just staying silent for personal gain. \n\nEthically, there's a debate about complicity. By not speaking out, are they enabling the grandfather's harmful behavior? However, the author is in a vulnerable position, risking their inheritance and family standing. They might not be in a position to confront without facing serious consequences. Also, the inheritance is part of the grandfather's estate, which the author is legally entitled to unless they disclaim it. \n\nSome might argue that the author is being pragmatic and not engaging in the harmful behavior themselves. Others might say that remaining silent in the face of racism and homophobia is a moral failing, even if they don't actively agree. But the author is not participating in the harmful actions beyond passive agreement. \n\nIt's a complex situation where personal ethics clash with family dynamics and financial security. The answer might depend on whether complicity through silence is considered wrong in this context. However, since the author isn't endorsing the views beyond nodding, and given the consequences of speaking up, it's debatable whether they are in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a stronger argument either way. The key points are the author's lack of active promotion, the fear of consequences, and the fact that they don't share the views. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
