I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure inheritance. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The grandfather is described as a racist, homophobic person. The author disagrees with these views but pretends to agree to avoid being ostracized, like their cousin was. The cousin tried to confront the grandfather and got kicked out. The author wants to keep the inheritance, which they believe is only possible by staying silent. They feel conflicted but see it as necessary because they need the money.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider ethics here. On one hand, the author is complicit by not speaking out against harmful views. Complicity can be a form of moral wrongdoing, especially when it's possible to take a stand without immediate harm. The author is choosing to stay silent to benefit themselves, which might be seen as morally wrong. However, the author is facing a threat of ostracism or losing the inheritance if they speak up, which complicates things. \n\nBut the author isn't just staying silent; they are actively pretending to agree, which is a form of insincerity. Pretending to hold those views might be seen as endorsing them, even if they don't. However, in this context, the author is using a strategy to protect their own interests. The cousin's experience shows the consequences of speaking up, so the author is taking a pragmatic approach to survive family dynamics and financial security.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, there's a conflict between personal gain and moral integrity. The author's actions might be justified as self-preservation, but they are enabling harmful behavior. However, since the author isn't acting on the racist or homophobic views\u2014only feigning agreement\u2014it's a matter of whether silence and insincerity are wrong when real harm is involved.\n\nI think the author is in a tough spot. They aren't directly causing harm, but they aren't preventing it either. However, they are benefiting from someone else's harmful traits. Some might argue that the author is wrong because they are complicit by not taking any action to challenge the grandfather's views. Others might say they are just surviving a toxic environment and shouldn't be blamed for their self-interest. \n\nBut in terms of moral responsibility, even if you don't act, if you can act without great personal risk, you might still be in the wrong. However, the author's cousin was ostracized, so acting out might have real consequences. The author is choosing to avoid those consequences, which could be seen as self-preservation rather than moral failure. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author is not in the wrong because of the circumstances. They are actively opposing the views but can't express it due to the threat of losing everything. So the answer would be B.\n"
