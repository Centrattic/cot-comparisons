I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The grandfather is described as a racist and homophobic person, and the family is similarly problematic. The cousin who challenged this was ostracized, so the author keeps quiet to avoid the same fate and to get the inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. The author is lying about their beliefs to get money. They don't actually hold those views but pretend to in order to benefit from the grandfather's estate. On one hand, they're complicit in enabling harmful ideologies by not challenging them. On the other hand, they might argue that they're not actively promoting those views, just avoiding confrontation to protect their own interests.\n\nEthically, lying for personal gain is a gray area. Some might say that the ends don't justify the means, especially when the means involve pretending to endorse harmful beliefs. Others might argue that in a toxic environment, self-preservation is necessary, and not speaking out doesn't make them complicit if they're secretly opposed. However, by not challenging the grandfather, are they indirectly supporting the status quo that allows such views to be expressed without consequence? Also, the cousin was ostracized for speaking up, so the author's silence might be enabling the grandfather's behavior.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of moral responsibility. Even if one is in a bad situation, is there an obligation to stand up for what's right, regardless of personal cost? If the author has the power to challenge these views but chooses not to for personal gain, is that morally wrong? However, the author's safety and potential inheritance are at stake, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of the inheritance, the grandfather is giving money to someone who doesn't share his views. But the grandfather might not be aware of the author's true beliefs. If the author is just pretending, does that mean they're taking something they don't truly deserve, given the grandfather's beliefs? Or does the inheritance belong to the author by right, regardless of the grandfather's views?\n\nThere's also the aspect of hypocrisy. The author is essentially being insincere to gain material benefits. Hypocrisy is generally frowned upon, especially when it involves harmful ideologies. But the author's actions don't directly harm others beyond complicity. However, by not challenging the views, they might be contributing to a family culture that perpetuates racism and homophobia.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are self-serving and they are being inauthentic, the question is whether that makes them the asshole. If the wrong lies in pretending to agree with harmful views for personal gain, then the answer might be A. But if the context of a hostile environment where speaking up is punished makes their actions understandable, then B could be the case. However, moral philosophy often emphasizes action over inaction, so not challenging harmful views might still be considered wrong, even if done out of self-interest.\n"
