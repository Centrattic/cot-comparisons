I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. Hmm. So the author's grandfather is a bigoted person, and the family mostly shares those views. The cousin who called them out was ostracized. The author is keeping quiet to avoid being kicked out and to get the inheritance. They feel guilty but are justifying it because the grandfather is old and might die soon.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author isn't acting on their beliefs, just pretending. They're not causing harm directly, but they're complicit by staying silent. The question is whether their actions make them an asshole. \n\nOn one hand, the author is complicit in a harmful environment by not speaking up. Even if they're in a bad situation, their silence might enable the grandfather's behavior. Also, using someone's death as a means to an end could be seen as callous. \n\nOn the other hand, they're in a tough spot. The family dynamics are toxic, and they might be afraid of losing support or inheritance. People often have to make difficult choices in such family situations. The author isn't directly participating in harmful actions, just not challenging them. \n\nBut morally, is pretending agreement with such views wrong? If you can't speak out without severe consequences, maybe the situation is more nuanced. However, staying silent in the face of racism and homophobia is a choice. The author might be prioritizing personal gain over standing up for what's right. \n\nInheritances are a big deal, and people do make decisions based on self-preservation. But the question is about being in the wrong. The author's actions are selfish, but are they in the wrong? It depends on societal morals. Complicity is often considered complicity, even if you're not the one spreading the hate. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (yes, they're in the wrong) because they're complicit and using their grandfather's death for gain. But others might argue it's B (not in the wrong) because they're not actively participating and are in a bad situation. The line is blurry here. The key points are complicity vs. self-preservation. The author's actions support the grandfather's harmful environment, which is a problem. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n"
