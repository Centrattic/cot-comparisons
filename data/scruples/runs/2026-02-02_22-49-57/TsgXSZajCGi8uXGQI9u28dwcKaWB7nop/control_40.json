I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. The author is complicit in enabling harmful ideologies by not challenging them. While they don't personally hold those views, their silence and feigned agreement could be seen as complicity. That's a strong ethical point against them.\n\nThen there's the aspect of inheritance. The grandfather's behavior is clearly abhorrent, but the author is exploiting that for personal financial gain. It's a utilitarian approach\u2014maximizing their own benefit at the expense of others' well-being. This could be viewed as selfishness.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a vulnerable position. They're afraid of being ostracized, like their cousin, which is a real risk. Financial security is a significant motivator, especially if they depend on the inheritance. But does that justify moral compromise?\n\nLegal aspects might not apply here since the grandfather's views don't make him illegal, just bigoted. The author's actions are legal, but ethically questionable. They're prioritizing personal gain over standing up for what's right, which is a key point in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) context.\n\nAlso, considering the psychological impact, the author's self-hatred from pretending suggests internal conflict. They're not just passive; they're actively choosing to stay silent despite their values. That might tip the scales toward being in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's situation is complex, their actions involve complicity and self-interest over moral integrity. So the answer is likely A (in the wrong).\n"
