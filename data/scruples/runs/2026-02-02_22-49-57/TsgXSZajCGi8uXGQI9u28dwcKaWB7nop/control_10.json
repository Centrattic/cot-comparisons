I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's grandfather is described as racist and homophobic, with the whole family being similar. The author disagrees but keeps quiet because they don't want to be ostracized like their cousin. They also want to inherit money, so they pretend to agree. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author is complicit in not confronting harmful views, is being inauthentic, and is using their grandfather for financial gain. But is that morally wrong?\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't actively participating in harm. They're just keeping quiet. But by smiling and nodding, they might be enabling the grandfather's behavior. However, the alternative could be losing inheritance and being ostracized. \n\nMoral philosophy might suggest that individuals have a duty to oppose racism and homophobia. But the author is in a dilemma between their moral beliefs and self-preservation. Also, considering the consequence of losing their inheritance and potential family support, they might see this as a necessary evil.\n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, is it wrong to prioritize self-interest in this case? The author isn't causing direct harm; they're just not opposing it. However, complicity can be seen as a form of moral wrong. Yet, in real-life situations, people often make tough choices. \n\nAnother angle: the author is being hypocritical, but is that the same as being an asshole? The term \"asshole\" here is colloquial, implying someone who is unkind or inconsiderate. The author's actions are self-serving but not necessarily malicious. They're not harming anyone except themselves by not being true to their values.\n\nThe cousin was ostracized for speaking up, which shows the family's toxic environment. The author's decision might be a survival strategy. However, by not challenging the grandfather, they're allowing hate speech to continue. But if they speak up, they risk losing the inheritance and being kicked out. \n\nIs the author wrong for choosing self-preservation over activism? It's a complex situation. The author's intentions are mixed: they want the inheritance but also don't support the grandfather's views. They feel guilt but also see a practical reason to stay quiet.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, most people might understand the dilemma but still argue that the author is complicit. However, others might see it as a pragmatic choice given the circumstances. The key is whether the author is actively harming others by their silence. Since they're not, maybe they're not in the wrong.\n\nBut the question is about being an \"asshole.\" The term often implies a lack of empathy or consideration. The author is conflicted and guilty, which suggests they do have empathy. So maybe they're not the asshole. Alternatively, their self-interest could be seen as selfish, but in a harmful situation, survival might be justified.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is in a toxic environment where they're not causing harm but are using a strategy to protect themselves. They are not the instigator of the racism or homophobia, just passive. However, some might argue that even passive complicity is wrong. But given the options, the answer is likely B.\n"
