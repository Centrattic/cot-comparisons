I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure their inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. The grandfather's views are clearly harmful and offensive. The author is complicit by not challenging these views, but they're doing so to gain financially. That raises the question of moral responsibility. Even if the author doesn't personally hold these views, their silence allows the grandfather's harmful ideology to continue unchecked. \n\nThen there's the aspect of inheritance. The author is essentially valuing financial gain over opposing injustice. Some might argue that they have a duty to stand against racism and homophobia, regardless of personal benefit. However, others might see it as a pragmatic choice to avoid conflict and secure their inheritance in a family that ostracizes dissent.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the author's self-respect. The author mentions hating themselves for their complicity, which indicates internal conflict. This suggests a struggle between personal ethics and financial security. But does that make them the asshole? Or is it a survival tactic in a toxic family environment?\n\nAlso, the cousin was ostracized for speaking out, which adds context. The author might be protecting themselves from similar treatment. However, by remaining silent, they're enabling the grandfather's harmful behavior. \n\nIn terms of moral philosophy, utilitarianism might assess the consequences: the author gains money, but the grandfather's harmful influence persists. Deontological ethics would look at the action itself\u2014lying and complicity are wrong regardless of outcomes. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are considered morally wrong despite their intentions. While there's understandable self-preservation, the complicity in harmful views is ethically problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
