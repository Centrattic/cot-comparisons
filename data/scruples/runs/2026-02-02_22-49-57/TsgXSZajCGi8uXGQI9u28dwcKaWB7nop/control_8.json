I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The grandfather is described as a bigoted person, and the family is similar. The author keeps quiet to avoid being ostracized like their cousin and to get the inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is not actively opposing harmful views but is instead complicit by staying silent and pretending to agree. While they don't hold those views themselves, their inaction allows the grandfather's harmful rhetoric to continue. \n\nIn terms of morality, many ethical frameworks emphasize the importance of standing up against injustice. Even if it's difficult, there's an argument that the author has a responsibility to not enable or condone harmful behavior, even for personal gain. However, the author is in a vulnerable position, fearing loss of inheritance and social standing. The cousin was ostracized for speaking up, which adds to the pressure.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't actively committing the racist acts, but they are complicit by not speaking out. Complicity can be considered a form of moral wrongness, especially when the person has the opportunity to act but chooses not to for self-interest. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is a human being who is prioritizing their own financial security. It's a survival tactic in a toxic family environment. However, ethics often require more than just non-harm; they require active good when possible. The author's self-preservation might be understandable, but the moral obligation to oppose injustice could override personal benefit.\n\nIn many discussions, passive complicity is seen as problematic because it allows harmful systems to persist. The author's actions don't directly harm others, but they do enable the grandfather's harmful worldview by not challenging it. Therefore, even though the author isn't the source of the racism, their role in perpetuating it through silence could be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), as their inaction in the face of prejudice contributes to the continuation of harmful attitudes, even if they are doing it for personal reasons.\n"
