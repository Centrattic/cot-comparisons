I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if they're in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. They describe their grandfather as constantly using slurs and the family as similar. The cousin who called them out was ostracized, so they stay silent.\n\nHmm, the first thing that comes to mind is the ethics of lying to inherit money. On one hand, the person is compromising their values by not confronting the grandfather. But they also have a reason: avoiding being cut off and getting the inheritance. That raises the question: is it acceptable to lie to maintain a relationship or protect one's financial future, even if the views are harmful?\n\nNow, the grandfather's health is poor, and they think he's near the end of his life. They tolerate the slurs for a short period. The user is conflicted, feeling guilty but also seeing the end goal. The main points here are about moral integrity versus self-preservation.\n\nI should consider the potential consequences. By pretending to agree, the user isn't actively supporting the views, but they're complicit by silence. However, if they don't agree, they risk losing the inheritance and the family relationship. But is it right to prioritize money over one's beliefs?\n\nAlso, the cousin was ostracized, which is a real concern. The user might fear the same outcome. But maybe there's a third way, like working with a lawyer to secure the inheritance without direct confrontation. However, the user might not have considered that or might not have the option.\n\nEthically, most people would say it's wrong to lie and be complicit in harmful ideologies. But the user is in a difficult position, balancing personal ethics with practical considerations. The key here is whether the user is actively participating in the spread of these views or just staying silent. The user is smiling and nodding, which could be seen as tacit approval, even if not genuine.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the inheritance. The user is looking at the grandfather as a \"pinata\" for money, which is a bit callous, but understandable from a self-interest angle. However, valuing money over familial relationships or ethical standpoints can be seen as selfish. But given that the grandfather's views are so harmful, some might argue that the user is making a necessary sacrifice.\n\nI think the answer depends on the perspective. If the user is maintaining a facade to avoid conflict and ensure they receive the inheritance, they're not endorsing the views, but they're not challenging them either. That passive acceptance might be seen as unethical. However, the alternative of losing the inheritance could be a significant personal loss. The user is in a tough spot, but compromising their values even passively could make them an asshole in the eyes of some. Others might understand the pragmatism involved. I need to decide if the user's actions are morally wrong despite the circumstances. Since they are not actively opposing but also not supporting, it's a gray area. But the question is about the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context. In those scenarios, the community often looks at the core of the issue. The grandfather is the one with the harmful views, but the user is lying to their face. So, maybe the user isn't the asshole, but they are in a difficult position. However, the act of pretending to agree with such views could be seen as wrong because it allows the grandfather to continue unchallenged, which might perpetuate harm. Alternatively, maybe the user is not at fault because they're not the one spreading the views. I'm a bit torn here. But in AITA contexts, people often consider intent. The user's intent is self-preservation and financial security. The grandfather's views are the root problem. So maybe the answer is B (No), the user isn't in the wrong, but it's a close call. However, if the user is comfortable with their actions and the justification is clear, they might be excused. But if the user is using the money as a justification for not confronting the grandfather, that could be seen as the wrong thing to do. I think the answer is A (Yes), because even though the grandfather is the one with the problematic views, the user is complicit by not challenging them, which is morally wrong. But the user is under threat of losing the inheritance, which complicates it. Wait, in AITA, the \"asshole\" is usually the one who does something wrong despite better judgment. The user is being hypocritical but not acting maliciously. So maybe B (No), they're not at fault because the grandfather is the one with the bad views, and the user is just trying to get along to avoid conflict and get the inheritance. The user isn't spreading the views, just not opposing them. The cousin was ostracized for confrontation, so the user is choosing not to take that risk. That's a valid reason in the context of the story. So the user isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
