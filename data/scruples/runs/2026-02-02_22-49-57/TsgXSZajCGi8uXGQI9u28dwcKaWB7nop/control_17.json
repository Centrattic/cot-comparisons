I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The grandfather is described as a bigoted person, and the author is conflicted because they secretly hate those views but are staying silent to avoid ostracism and to get the inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. The author isn't actually holding those views; they're just pretending. But by doing so, are they complicit in the grandfather's harmful beliefs? On one hand, the author is choosing not to confront the grandfather, which could be seen as enabling the grandfather's behavior. On the other hand, the author is in a vulnerable position, possibly fearing retaliation and losing the inheritance. The cousin who spoke up was ostracized, so the author is taking a safer route to protect themselves financially.\n\nEthically, is it wrong to pretend to agree with something you despise for personal gain? Some might argue that the author is being insincere and possibly complicit by not speaking out. Others might say that the author is making a pragmatic choice to avoid harm and that their personal beliefs are still valid even if they don't express them in that environment. However, there's also the aspect of using someone's death for financial gain, which can be seen as morally questionable, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nInheritances are often tied to family dynamics and legacies. If the author is benefiting from someone's estate while that person is alive and holding harmful views, does that make the author complicit in perpetuating those views? The author isn't actively promoting them but is staying silent. The line between personal conviction and survival/pragmatism is thin here.\n\nAnother angle: the grandfather's behavior is harmful, and the author's inaction could be seen as allowing that behavior to continue unchecked. The cousin's experience shows that dissent is met with punishment, so the author is choosing self-preservation. But is that justification enough? It's a tough call because the author's intention is to avoid conflict and gain financial security, which are understandable motives.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, intent matters. The author's intent isn't to support the views but to survive and obtain the inheritance. However, the consequences of their inaction (not challenging the grandfather) might contribute to the continuation of harmful ideologies within the family. But the author isn't directly causing harm; they're just not stopping it. \n\nThere's also the aspect of hypocrisy. The author is being hypocritical in their actions, which some might view as a moral failing. But hypocrisy alone isn't necessarily wrong if it's done to protect oneself in a dangerous or oppressive environment. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions are morally ambiguous. They are not actively promoting the views but are complicit through inaction. The decision to prioritize personal gain over challenging harmful beliefs is ethically questionable, but the context of potential ostracism and the example of the cousin complicates things. \n\nHowever, the core question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer hinges on not speaking out against injustice for personal gain, then the author might be seen as in the wrong. But if the context of self-preservation and the fear of losing the inheritance is considered a valid reason, then maybe not. It's a nuanced situation without clear right or wrong answers. \n\nIn the AITA context, the community often values moral integrity over pragmatism. So the author might be called an asshole for pretending to agree with harmful views to gain money. But others might argue that the author is in a tough situation and making the best of it. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they are complicit by silence in harmful beliefs, even if they don't actively support them. The financial gain from someone's death while that person is alive and expressing harmful views adds to the ethical dilemma. However, the fear of retaliation and the cousin's experience might mitigate some responsibility. Still, the act of pretending to agree with such views for personal gain is ethically problematic.\n"
