I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The grandfather is described as having harmful views, and the author is feigning agreement to avoid conflict and maintain their inheritance rights. The cousin who spoke out was ostracized, so the author stays silent out of fear of similar consequences and to not lose the inheritance.\n\nNow, considering ethics. The author is complicit by not speaking out against the grandfather's harmful statements. While they don't hold those views themselves, their silence could be seen as tacit approval. However, they are in a vulnerable position, fearing social exclusion and financial loss. The question is whether their actions make them an \"asshole.\"\n\nMoral philosophy might approach this with deontological ethics (duty-based) vs. consequentialism. Deontologically, lying or being complicit in harmful speech is wrong regardless of consequences. Consequentialism would look at the outcomes\u2014maybe the author is avoiding harm to themselves and could later use the inheritance for good, but they're enabling harmful attitudes.\n\nLegally, there's nothing wrong with not speaking out unless there's a duty to intervene, which is often not the case. However, morally, the dilemma is complex. The author is sacrificing their principles for personal gain, which many might judge as selfish.\n\nBut the alternative is being cut off from the inheritance and possibly family. The society often grapples with the balance between personal ethics and family loyalty. The author's justification is self-preservation and financial security, which are valid concerns but conflict with their values.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, some might view the author's actions as pragmatic, others as morally compromised. Since the question is about being an \"asshole,\" which is subjective, but the community often values standing up against injustice even when it's difficult.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. They're not actively causing harm but are complicit. The answer hinges on whether passive complicity in harmful views is considered wrong. Given the context, many would argue the author is in the wrong because they're prioritizing personal gain over moral integrity, even if the situation is understandable.\n"
