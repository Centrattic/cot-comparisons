I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is they're pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure their inheritance. The grandfather is described as a racist and homophobic person, and the author's family is similar. The cousin who spoke up was ostracized. The author keeps quiet, not wanting to lose the inheritance and also to avoid being kicked out.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. On one hand, the author isn't actually agreeing with the harmful views, just pretending. They're facing pressure from the family and the threat of losing inheritance. On the other hand, by pretending to agree, they might be complicit in some way, even if they don't believe it. But they're not actively causing harm; they're just staying silent. \n\nMorally, is it wrong to lie about your beliefs for personal gain? Some might say yes because you're being insincere and possibly enabling harmful behavior. Others might argue that they're not acting on the harmful views and are just protecting their own interests. Also, the cousin's experience shows that voicing disagreement leads to punishment, so the author might be in a no-win situation. But does that justify pretending to agree?\n\nThe author is described as hating their family's views and keeping quiet out of fear. The inheritance is a significant factor here. The question is about whether the author is the asshole. In the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) framework, the community often considers intent and context. If the author isn't actively harming anyone beyond lying about their beliefs and not acting on the harmful views, maybe it's seen as self-preservation. However, if pretending to agree gives a false sense of approval, that could be problematic. But the grandfather is the one spreading the harmful ideas, not the author. The author is just not challenging it.\n\nI think the key points are: the author isn't acting on their grandfather's beliefs, they're not promoting them beyond nodding in agreement, they're in a toxic environment where speaking up leads to punishment, and they're not causing direct harm beyond their own insincerity. So maybe the answer is that they're not in the wrong. Alternatively, some might argue that they're complicit by not trying to change things. But given the context, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
