I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is complicit in enabling harmful behavior by not speaking out against their grandfather's bigotry. They're also using their grandfather's death as a means to an end, which could be seen as morally questionable.\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't actively promoting those views; they're just pretending to agree. They might be avoiding conflict to protect themselves from ostracization, which is a real concern, especially if the cousin was already punished for speaking out. There's also the aspect of self-preservation and financial security. Inheritance can be a significant financial resource, so the author might feel pressured to stay silent.\n\nHowever, enabling harmful ideologies, even passively, can be ethically problematic. By not challenging the grandfather's views, the author is allowing those harmful beliefs to persist and possibly influence others. The author's self-hatred suggests they recognize the immorality of their actions, which complicates the situation. It's a conflict between personal ethics and survival/practicality.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of moral responsibility. If the author has the opportunity to stand up against racism and homophobia but chooses not to, are they complicit? Even if they don't agree, their silence might be seen as tacit approval. The cousin's experience shows the risks of speaking out, so the author's decision to stay quiet could be a calculated risk to avoid harm.\n\nBut then again, the author isn't directly harming anyone by staying silent. They're not spreading the same slurs. They're just avoiding confrontation. In some contexts, maintaining personal safety and financial stability might be prioritized over moral objections, especially when there's no immediate way to change the family's views.\n\nThe question also touches on the morality of benefiting from someone's wealth who holds bigoted views. The author isn't in the wrong for valuing financial security, but they might be in the wrong for not challenging the grandfather's harmful beliefs when they can. However, the situation is complex because they're in a vulnerable position, with potential consequences for speaking out.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions are ethically ambiguous, the act of pretending to agree with harmful beliefs to gain personal benefit does involve complicity. However, the context of potential ostracization and the lack of immediate power to change the situation might mitigate some of the blame. The answer might lean towards A (yes, in the wrong) because enabling bigotry, even passively, has moral costs. But there's also a case for B (not in the wrong) due to the personal risks involved.\n"
