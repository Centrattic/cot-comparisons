We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told their biological family. Their family is described as controlling and abusive, with a narcissistic mother and a grandfather running the family like a cult. The user ran away at 20 due to this environment. The family only contacts them occasionally with hostile texts.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling their mom and family about the pregnancy. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe key factors here are the family's behavior. The user left due to abuse, which is a significant red flag. The family's controlling nature, invasion of privacy, and religious extremism create a toxic environment. The user is now in a stable relationship and has a child. They fear the family's reaction, including potential harassment, judgment about being unmarried, and possible harm to their child. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if the family is abusive and the user is protecting themselves and their child, not contacting them isn't wrong. The family initiated contact with hostility, so the responsibility isn't on the user to maintain those relations. The user is prioritizing their well-being and their child's safety, which is valid. \n\nHowever, some might argue that not informing family about a grandchild could be seen as withholding information. But given the context of abuse and the family's behavior, this doesn't seem like a typical family situation. The user isn't hiding the pregnancy in a normal family dynamic but is avoiding contact with abusers. \n\nThe user's boyfriend hasn't pressured them, which adds that they're making this decision without external pressure. The guilt they feel is understandable, but the fear of harm to themselves and their child is a stronger justification. \n\nIn conclusion, considering the family's abusive history and the user's self-preservation, the author is not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
