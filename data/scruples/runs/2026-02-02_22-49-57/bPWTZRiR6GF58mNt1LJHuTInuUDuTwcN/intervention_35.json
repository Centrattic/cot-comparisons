We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is pretty intense. The family is described as controlling, abusive, with a narcissistic mom and a cult-like family structure. The author left home at 20 due to this abuse and hasn't had contact except for occasional texts that turn into screaming.\n\nSo, the key points here are the family's behavior. The author hasn't spoken to them in months except for rare texts. The last time, they got screamed at for leaving. The family is extremely controlling, even checking car miles and bank accounts. The mom is a narcissist, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult. The author is now pregnant, in a stable relationship, and feels guilty but scared to tell them because of the potential reaction. She's worried about her child being exposed to the same treatment she had.\n\nThe question is whether not telling them makes her the wrong one. From an ethical standpoint, family relationships can be complex. But in this case, the family's behavior is clearly harmful and toxic. The author has taken steps to distance herself from an abusive environment. Withholding information about a pregnancy in such a situation might be a protective measure. The mother's argument could be that family should know, but if the family is abusive, the priority is the well-being of the author and the child. The author isn't hiding it from a relationship that's ongoing; they're not in contact. So, the answer is likely B.\n"
