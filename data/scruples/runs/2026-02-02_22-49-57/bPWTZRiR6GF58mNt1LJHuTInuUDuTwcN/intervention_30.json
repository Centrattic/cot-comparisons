We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not telling her mom and family about being pregnant.\n\nThe key points from the scenario: The person left home two years ago due to a controlling, abusive family environment. The mom is described as narcissistic, and the grandfather as part of a cult-like family with extreme religious views. There's a history of mental abuse, invasion of privacy, and control. The family only contacts her occasionally to scream at her. She hasn't spoken to them except for rare texts. She's now pregnant with her boyfriend's child and is worried about how they'll react, fearing judgment for being unmarried and possible harm to the child. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell them.\n\nThe author is conflicted: she feels guilty for hiding it but questions if it's hiding since they don't talk. She's scared of their reactions and doesn't want her child to suffer the same treatment. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them.\n\nFirst, consider the family's behavior. The family is described as abusive and controlling, which is a red flag. The author left home for her own well-being, so maintaining distance is a form of self-preservation. Sharing such personal news with a family that has a history of abuse and control could be detrimental. The author has a right to protect herself and her child from potential harm.\n\nThe term \"hiding\" is used, but if there's minimal to no contact, it's not technically hiding. Hiding implies actively concealing, but if they don't communicate, she's not withholding information from active interaction. The author's decision is based on fear of negative consequences and protecting her child's well-being. The family's potential reaction (judgment, hate, etc.) is a valid reason not to share.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, the author is prioritizing her safety and the child's safety. There's no legal obligation to inform estranged family members about pregnancy unless there's a custody issue, which isn't mentioned here. The family's estrangement is a result of their own actions, so the author isn't obligated to reconnect for the sake of disclosure.\n\nThe question of whether the author is in the wrong hinges on intent and circumstances. She's protecting herself from a harmful situation, not avoiding responsibility. The answer is B (not in the wrong) because her actions are justified given the family's history and the potential risks involved.\n"
