We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. The author has a complicated relationship with their biological family. They left home because of a controlling and abusive environment, including a narcissistic mother and a grandfather who runs the family like a cult. The family is extremely religious and controlling. The author hasn't spoken much with them, only occasional texts that turn into arguments. They're 37 weeks pregnant and haven't told their family yet. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them, but they feel guilty. They're scared of the family's reaction, potential judgment about being unmarried, and also worried about their child's future interactions with the family.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abuse and control by the family. The author left home to escape that. Telling them now could risk the child being exposed to that toxic environment. The question is whether not telling them makes the author in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the family isn't part of the child's life and the author is protecting their child from a harmful situation, then not contacting them might be justified. The author's safety and the child's well-being are priorities. However, some might argue that the child has a right to know their family, but if the family is harmful, that right is outweighed by the need for protection. The author isn't cutting off contact entirely out of spite; they're avoiding a toxic dynamic. \n\nLegally, there might not be an obligation to inform estranged family, especially if there's a history of abuse. Emotionally, the author is dealing with fear and past trauma. The guilt they feel is understandable, but it doesn't make them wrong if their decision is in the best interest of their child and themselves. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). They are prioritizing their and their child's well-being over a family that has caused them harm. The decision isn't about hiding the pregnancy but avoiding re-engagement with toxic individuals.\n"
