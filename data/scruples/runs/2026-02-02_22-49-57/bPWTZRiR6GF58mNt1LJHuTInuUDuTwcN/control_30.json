We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. Their family has a history of being controlling and abusive. They left home at 20 because of the environment. Now, they're in a stable relationship and pregnant. The question is whether not informing their family makes them at fault.\n\nFirst, consider the reasons they haven't told their family. The family is described as narcissistic, controlling, and abusive. The user has cut ties except for occasional, negative contact. The fear is that telling them about the pregnancy would lead to criticism, especially about being unmarried, and potential harm to the child. The user is worried about their child being exposed to the same toxic environment they experienced.\n\nThe main points to evaluate are the family's behavior versus the user's autonomy. The user has a right to protect themselves and their child from potential harm. The family's actions in the past justify the user's hesitation. The fact that they haven't been in regular contact and that communication is minimal supports the idea that there's no obligation to update them. The user isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone who's actively involved in their life; rather, it's from estranged family members who have been harmful. The guilt mentioned might stem from societal expectations, but the user's well-being and their child's safety are more critical. So, the answer would likely be that the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
