We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The situation is that the author hasn't spoken to her family for a long time except for occasional hostile texts. She left home due to a controlling, abusive family environment. Now she's pregnant and considering whether to tell them.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The family is described as controlling and abusive, with a narcissistic mother and a grandfather who runs a cult-like family. The author left because of this, which is a significant factor. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her, but she's feeling guilty. She's worried about their reaction, potential harassment, and the impact on her child.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the family's behavior and the author's safety and well-being. If the family is abusive and has a pattern of controlling behavior, contacting them could put the author and her child at risk. In such cases, maintaining distance is often advised by professionals to prevent harm.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not informing her family. Legally and ethically, there's no obligation to inform family members, especially if they are not supportive. The author's decision is based on protecting herself and her child from potential abuse and harassment. \n\nSome might argue that family has a right to know, but when the family is harmful, the priority shifts to safety. The author has valid reasons rooted in her past experiences. The guilt she feels is understandable, but it's important to recognize that her choice is a form of self-preservation. \n\nAlso, considering the child's future, the author is concerned about her being exposed to a toxic environment. This is a responsible consideration. There's no evidence that the family has changed, so keeping them away is in the best interest of the child.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Her decision is based on protecting herself and her child from a harmful family dynamic. The answer should be B.\n"
