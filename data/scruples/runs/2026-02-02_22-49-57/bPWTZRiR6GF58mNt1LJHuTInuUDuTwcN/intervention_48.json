We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is pretty detailed, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. They haven't been on speaking terms for a while, only occasional texts where they end up yelling. She ran away at 20 because of a controlling, abusive family. Her mom is described as a narcissist, and the family is extremely religious and controlling. They had a history of invading her privacy and controlling her life. Now she's with someone who makes her happy and is pregnant with his child.\n\nShe's conflicted because she feels guilty but is terrified of their reaction. She's worried about the family's response, the baby's future with them, and whether she's hiding it. The key points here are the family's past behavior, the lack of communication, and the potential harm if they find out.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I need to decide if the answer is A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFrom what I read, the family has a history of abuse and control. The author left for her well-being. Not telling them seems like a protective measure. They haven't been in contact much, so hiding it isn't in bad faith. The main issue is the potential for harm. If the author tells them, it could lead to conflict, stress, and maybe even the family trying to interfere. The baby's well-being is a priority here. The author's decision to not tell them is about protecting herself and her child from toxic family members.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend hasn't pressured her, so there's no external pressure from him. The guilt might come from societal expectations, but her circumstances are unique. The author's mental health and the child's safety are valid reasons. So, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because she's protecting herself and her child from a harmful family dynamic.\n"
