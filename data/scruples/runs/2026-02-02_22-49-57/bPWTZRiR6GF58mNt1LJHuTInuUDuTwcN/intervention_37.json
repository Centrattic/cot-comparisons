We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is that they haven't spoken in a long time, and the family has been abusive and controlling. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person ran away from home due to a controlling, abusive family environment. The mom is described as a narcissist, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult. They controlled every aspect of her life, invading her privacy. Now, she's in a stable relationship and pregnant, but hasn't told her family.\n\nShe's feeling guilty but also scared of their reaction. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing them. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks she isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nIn cases like this, where someone has left an abusive situation, their decisions about contact with family are often protected. The author has valid reasons for not contacting them, especially if the family is likely to react negatively. The fact that they haven't been in regular contact and that previous interactions were hostile supports her decision. Also, protecting the child from a potentially harmful environment is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family should be informed, but given the history, this seems like a personal choice rooted in self-preservation and the child's well-being. The fact that the family hasn't reached out except to harass her adds weight to her position. \n\nSo, considering the abuse and the potential harm, the author is justified in her decision. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
