We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is that the author hasn't spoken to her family in a while except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. She ran away at 20 due to a controlling, abusive family environment. Now she's pregnant, in a happy relationship, and feels conflicted about telling her family.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The family is described as controlling, abusive, and part of a religious cult-like structure. The mother is a narcissist, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult. The author left because of mental abuse and control. She hasn't contacted them, they only reach out to harrass her. \n\nThe key points here are the family's behavior and the author's reasons for not telling them. The question is whether she's wrong for not informing her mother. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the situation.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's decision is influenced by her past trauma and the potential harm her family could cause. The family's controlling nature and past behavior make it a dangerous situation. The author is protecting herself and her unborn child from possible abuse or manipulation. \n\nHowever, some might argue that there's a responsibility to inform family members about a new life. But given the context of the family's behavior, not informing them could be seen as a necessary protective measure. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from people who are actively part of her life; her family has been absent except for negative interactions. \n\nAlso, the author's boyfriend hasn't pressured her, and she's struggling with guilt. The fear of her family's reaction, including judgment about being unmarried and potential harm to the child, is valid. The decision not to tell them is based on self-preservation and protecting the child from a harmful environment. \n\nIn similar situations, people with abusive families often choose not to reconnect to avoid further harm. The author's actions are a form of setting boundaries, which is important for mental health. \n\nTherefore, considering the context, the author isn't in the wrong. Her decision is a rational response to protect herself and her child from potential abuse and manipulation. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
