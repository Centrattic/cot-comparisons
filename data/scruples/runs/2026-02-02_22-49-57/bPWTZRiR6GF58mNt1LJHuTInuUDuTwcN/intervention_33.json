We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. First, I need to understand the situation properly.\n\nThe author is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. They aren't on speaking terms except for rare, negative texts. The family is described as controlling, abusive, and part of a cult-like environment with extreme religious views. She ran away at 20 due to this. Now she's with a partner who supports her, and she's unsure if she should tell her family. She's scared of their reaction, potential judgment, and how they might treat her child.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and control. If someone is in an abusive environment, it's understandable they might want to cut contact to protect themselves and their child. The family's behavior\u2014reading her car mileage, controlling her bank account, invading privacy\u2014sounds very toxic. The author prioritized her well-being by leaving and is now considering not telling them again to avoid harm.\n\nThe question is whether not informing them makes her wrong. From an ethical standpoint, if the family isn't part of her life and has shown hostility, she isn't obligated to update them. Especially since their presence could be harmful. The author is protecting herself and her child from potential abuse. The guilt she's feeling might stem from societal expectations, but her safety and her child's well-being are paramount. \n\nAlso, considering that the last contact was hostile, she's not hiding it in the traditional sense if they don't reach out. The term \"hiding\" implies secrecy when there's a relationship, but in this case, there's no ongoing communication. So, the answer would likely be B, she's not in the wrong. The main factors are the history of abuse and the decision to protect her child from a harmful environment.\n"
