We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about the pregnancy. The situation is complicated. The author had a very abusive family, ran away at 20, and now is pregnant. She hasn't told her family because she's scared of their reaction and doesn't want her child to go through the same abuse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family's history. The author describes her mom as narcissistic and the family as controlling and abusive. That's a red flag. If the family is abusive, keeping the pregnancy a secret could actually protect the child from further harm. The mother's intention isn't to hide the pregnancy out of selfishness but out of fear for her and her child's safety.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). If the family is abusive, then not contacting them isn't the wrong choice. The author is prioritizing her well-being and her baby's, which makes sense. The guilt comes from societal expectations, but her situation is unique. She's not avoiding contact; they haven't spoken in a long time. The last contact was hostile. So, she's not at fault here. The answer is B.\n"
