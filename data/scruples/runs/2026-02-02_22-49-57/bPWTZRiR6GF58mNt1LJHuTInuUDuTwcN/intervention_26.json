We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The author hasn't told her biological family because they're estranged and had a controlling, abusive environment. She ran away at 20 due to mental abuse and a cult-like family setup. Now she's pregnant, with a stable life and a supportive boyfriend. She's scared of her family's reaction\u2014likely criticism about being unmarried, potential harm to her baby, and fears of her family repeating the abuse.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks she's not in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Family obligations usually involve informing relatives about major life events like pregnancy. However, this isn't a typical situation. The family is estranged, has a history of abuse, and the author is protecting herself and her child. The mother is described as a narcissist, and the grandfather runs a cult-like family. The author left due to control and abuse. \n\nIn cases of abuse, self-preservation is valid. The author isn't in contact with her family except for occasional hostile texts. The family's values are extreme, and they might react negatively to an unmarried pregnancy. The author's fear is justified based on past experiences. Also, the baby's well-being is a concern if the grandparents were to interact with her. \n\nLegally, there's no obligation to inform family unless there's a court order or specific circumstances. Ethically, it's more about personal safety and health. Since the family is estranged and the author has a valid reason to fear for her and her child's safety, withholding information isn't wrong. The guilt she feels might come from societal expectations, but her situation is unique. \n\nTherefore, considering the abuse history and the potential risks, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
