We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's about to have a baby but hasn't told her biological family. The reasons given are that her family is abusive, controlling, and has a toxic environment. She ran away from home at 20 because of that. Now, she's with a partner who supports her, and she's pregnant.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling her family. The options are A (yes, she is in the wrong) or B (no, she isn't). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family is described as abusive and controlling. The mother is a narcissist, the grandfather runs the family like a cult, and they were very controlling in her life. She left to escape that. So, her decision not to tell them is based on a history of abuse and fear of their reaction. \n\nThe user is asking if she's at fault for keeping this secret. From a moral standpoint, sometimes not sharing news with family can be seen as wrong, especially if they are part of your life. But in this case, the family isn't in her life anymore. They haven't been in contact except for occasional hostile texts. She's not hiding it from active family members; they're estranged. \n\nAlso, she's concerned about the family's reaction. They might blame her for being unmarried and pregnant, which is their toxic view. She's worried about her child being exposed to that environment. So, her decision is based on protecting herself and her child from harm. \n\nIn terms of ethics, people have the right to make decisions that protect their well-being and that of their children. If sharing the news would lead to abuse or harm, not sharing it isn't necessarily wrong. The family isn't maintaining a healthy relationship, so the responsibility isn't on her to keep them updated if it's harmful. \n\nAnother angle: the question is if she's hiding it. Since they don't communicate, it's not hiding per se. They haven't reached out in a meaningful way. The last contacts were hostile. So, not sharing the news in that context isn't hiding but a protective measure. \n\nAlso, considering the child's future, she's thinking about whether the child might be harmed by the family. It's a valid concern. So, the decision is a protective one, not an act of selfishness.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions are based on self-preservation and protecting her child from a toxic environment. So the answer would be B.\n"
