We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they did something wrong by not telling their mom they're pregnant. The context is that they had a very abusive and controlling family. They left home at 20 because of the abuse, and now they're pregnant with their partner's child. They haven't told their family because they fear the reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. The user describes a history of control, mental abuse, and being part of a cult-like family that's extremely religious. They mention specific examples like tracking car mileage, controlling finances, and invading privacy. That's pretty severe. Leaving such an environment is a valid reason not to reconnect, especially if the family hasn't made any effort to change or reconcile.\n\nThe user hasn't been in contact with their family except for occasional texts where the family ends up yelling. The family hasn't initiated contact in a positive way. The user is worried that if they tell them about the pregnancy, the family will react negatively, possibly shaming them for being unmarried and not wanting the child to face the same treatment. There's also fear that the child might hate them for keeping the other family away.\n\nThe question is whether not telling the mother makes the user \"in the wrong.\" The user is in a stable relationship now and has built a life separate from their abusive family. The key points here are the history of abuse, lack of healthy communication from the family, and the user's valid fears for their child's well-being. \n\nIn many cases, protecting oneself and one's child from a toxic environment is seen as responsible. The user isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone who is part of their current life; the family hasn't been involved, and the user has left for valid reasons. The guilt comes from societal expectations or maybe feeling they should maintain the relationship despite the abuse. But given the family's behavior, not contacting them isn't the user's fault.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B. The user isn't in the wrong because they're protecting themselves and their child from a harmful situation. The family isn't making an effort to be positive, and the user has every right to prioritize their well-being and their child's.\n"
