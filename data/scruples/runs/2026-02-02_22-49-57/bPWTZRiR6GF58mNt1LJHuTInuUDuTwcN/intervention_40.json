We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author left her family two years ago because they were controlling and abusive. The mom is described as narcissistic, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult. They controlled her life, monitored her, and were very religious. Now she's pregnant with her boyfriend's child and hasn't told her family. She feels guilty but is terrified of their reaction. The family hasn't been in touch except for rare texts that turn into screaming matches. \n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and control. If someone is in a toxic environment, not keeping that information from the abusive party might be dangerous. The author is protecting herself and her unborn child from potential harm. The family might react negatively, maybe even try to interfere or take the child away. Also, the author hasn't been in contact with her family, so not sharing the news isn't exactly hiding it if there's no communication. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell, so the pressure is internal, from her own guilt.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the family is abusive, not contacting them could be a form of self-preservation. The mother might claim the author is hiding it, but if there's a history of abuse, the author has a valid reason to avoid contact. The decision to not tell them is about safety, not just secrecy. Also, considering the child's future, the author is worried about the family's treatment, which shows she's thinking about the child's well-being. \n\nThe question is about right and wrong. Legally, there's no obligation to inform estranged family. Emotionally, it's complicated, but the author's actions are driven by past trauma. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because she's protecting herself and her child from a harmful situation.\n"
