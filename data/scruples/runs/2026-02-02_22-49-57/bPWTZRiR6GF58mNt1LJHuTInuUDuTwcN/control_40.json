We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 37 weeks pregnant, hasn't told her family, and they have a strained relationship. She ran away at 20 due to a controlling, abusive, and religious family. They haven't spoken much since, only occasional texts that turn into screaming. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell. She's scared of their reaction, potential blame, and how they might treat her child. She's conflicted between guilt and fear.\n\nNow, considering the factors: the family's history of abuse and control, the lack of communication, her own safety and well-being, and her child's future. The author left an abusive environment, which is valid. She's protecting herself and her child from potential harm. Not telling them isn't about hiding if there's no contact. Guilt might come from societal expectations, but her situation is complex. The family's reaction could be harmful, so her decision to not inform them is a form of self-preservation. The question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's in a toxic situation and making a choice to protect herself and her child, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
