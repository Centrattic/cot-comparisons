We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. The author is 37 weeks pregnant, hasn't told their biological family, and has a history of a very controlling and abusive family. They ran away at 20 because of the family's control and mental abuse. The family is described as narcissistic, religious, and cult-like, controlling every aspect of the author's life before they left. Now, they're with a partner who makes them happy and have a baby on the way.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they feel guilty for not telling their family, but they're scared of the reaction. They think the family might blame them for hiding the pregnancy, criticize them for being unmarried, and potentially mistreat their child. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family's behavior was abusive and controlling. The author left because they needed to escape that environment. If they have no contact or very minimal contact, then not sharing the pregnancy might be a protective measure. The author is protecting their new life and their child from a toxic environment. The mother might argue that they have a right to know, but if the family's history is one of abuse, then the author's choice to distance themselves could be justified.\n\nHowever, some might argue that even if the family is toxic, there's a biological connection and a potential right to know from the grandparents. But in cases of abuse, the child's well-being is the priority. The author is making decisions based on past trauma and the desire to protect their new family. The boyfriend isn't pressuring them, which supports the idea that the author is making an autonomous choice here.\n\nThe key factors here are the history of abuse, the current lack of communication, and the potential harm if the family were to find out. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone they have a healthy relationship with; they're avoiding contact with people who have caused them harm. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their safety and their child's well-being. So the answer would be B.\n"
