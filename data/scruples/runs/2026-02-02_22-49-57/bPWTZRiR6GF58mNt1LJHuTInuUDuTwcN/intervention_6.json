We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author left her family two years ago because they were controlling and abusive. Her mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is extremely religious, pushing their values. She ran away at 20, found stability, a partner, and now is pregnant. She hasn't told her family, who only contact her to scream at her. She's worried about their reaction, possible judgment about being unmarried, and fears they might harm her child. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her. She's torn between guilt and fear of telling them.\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing her family. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). The user already thinks she's not in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is to assess the situation based on the provided facts. The author has a history of abuse and control. She left for her well-being. The family's sporadic contact is hostile. She's protecting herself and her unborn child from potential harm. Not telling them isn't about hiding if they don't communicate. The family's behavior suggests they could react negatively, which she has a right to avoid. The child's well-being is also a concern. So, the author's decision is more about self-preservation and protecting her child, not withholding information in a healthy relationship. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
