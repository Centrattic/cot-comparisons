We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is pretty intense. The author left her family two years ago due to severe control and abuse from her mom and grandfather, who are described as narcissistic and cult-like. They're religious and very controlling, invading privacy and controlling finances.\n\nShe's now pregnant, but hasn't told her family. The question is whether she's wrong for keeping it secret. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family has a history of abuse and control. The author hasn't been in contact with them except for rare texts that turn into screaming. She's scared they'll react negatively, especially since they might criticize her for being unmarried and pregnant. Also, she's worried about her child being exposed to that toxic environment.\n\nThe key points here are the prior abuse and the current non-relationship. The user's reasoning is that since contact is minimal and the family isn't supportive, not telling them isn't wrong. The author's safety and well-being, as well as her child's, are priorities. In such cases, protecting oneself from abusive family members is often advised. The fact that her boyfriend hasn't pressured her suggests he's respecting her boundaries. \n\nThe author might feel guilty, but given the circumstances, her decision to protect herself and her child from potential harm makes sense. The family's last interactions were hostile, and they don't engage in normal communication. So, hiding the pregnancy from them isn't hiding in a traditional sense if they aren't part of her life. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
