We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The key points from the situation are that the author has a very strained relationship with her biological family, who she describes as controlling, abusive, and part of a cult-like structure. She ran away at 20 and hasn't had much contact since. Now she's pregnant and considering whether to tell them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons behind her decision not to tell her family. The family is portrayed as abusive, with a narcissistic mother and a controlling grandfather. The author has a legitimate fear that sharing her pregnancy could lead to harassment or judgment, especially since they are very religious and might disapprove of her being unmarried. She's also worried about the potential negative impact on her child if the family is allowed to interact with them.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for withholding this information. From a moral standpoint, the responsibility of a parent to their child often includes connecting with family. However, in cases where the family is abusive or harmful, prioritizing the well-being of the child and oneself is also important. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone who has a regular, healthy relationship with her; instead, she's avoiding contact with people who have a history of abuse. \n\nThe concept of \"hiding\" might not apply here because there's no regular communication. The family reaches out rarely, and those interactions are hostile. Therefore, not disclosing the pregnancy in that context isn't necessarily hiding something from a relationship but rather protecting herself and her child from potential harm. \n\nAdditionally, the author's boyfriend hasn't pressured her, which suggests that her decision isn't based solely on external pressure but her own judgment. The conflict she feels is between her fear of the family's reaction and a sense of duty to inform them. However, given the family's past behavior, her choice to avoid contact is understandable. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's an assumption that family should be informed about a pregnancy, but this can vary based on individual circumstances. If the family isn't part of her life and is harmful, the ethical choice might be to keep them out. The well-being of the mother and child should be the priority, which supports her decision not to tell them.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because she's making a choice to protect herself and her child from an abusive family dynamic, which is a valid and responsible decision.\n"
