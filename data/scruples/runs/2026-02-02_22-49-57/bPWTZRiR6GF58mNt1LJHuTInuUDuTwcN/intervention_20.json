We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not telling their mom and family about being pregnant. The situation is that the author had a very abusive and controlling family, including a narcissistic mother and a cult-like grandfather. They ran away at 20, have been independent, are now pregnant with a stable partner, and haven't told the family. The family only contacts them occasionally with hostile texts.\n\nThe author is conflicted between guilt and fear of how the family would react. They mention the fear of the family accusing them of hiding it and the potential negative impact on the child. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the family's behavior. Abuse, control, invasion of privacy, and being cut off from the family are significant factors. The author's decision not to share the pregnancy seems rooted in self-preservation and protecting the child. The family isn't in contact, so it's not like the author is hiding it from active family involvement. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is intent and circumstances. The author isn't avoiding the family out of selfishness but due to legitimate fear for their safety and their child's. The family's history of abuse and control makes the decision to stay silent understandable. \n\nAlso, the author is not in contact with the family, so the lack of communication isn't hiding from people they're in regular contact with. The family's occasional hostile texts don't create a situation where disclosure is necessary. The author's priority is on their well-being and the child's, which is reasonable. \n\nThere's no legal obligation to inform family members about pregnancy unless in a custody scenario, which isn't mentioned here. The ethical aspect is more about the relationship dynamics. Since the author has left the family and they are estranged, it's their choice to disclose or not. The fear of the baby being exposed to harmful family dynamics adds another layer of justification for not telling.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They've made a decision based on protecting themselves and their child from a harmful environment. The answer should be B.\n"
