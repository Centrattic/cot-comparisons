We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The scenario is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 37 weeks pregnant, hasn't told her biological family, and they don't communicate except for rare texts that turn into screaming. She ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive family environment. Her mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and the family is religious and controlling. They controlled her life in numerous ways when she was living with them. Now she's with her boyfriend, has a stable life, and is pregnant. She's feeling guilty about not telling her family but is scared of how they'd react. She's worried about her baby not meeting the other side of the family.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider the user's perspective. They think the author isn't in the wrong. The key points here are the history of abuse, control, and the toxic family environment. The family hasn't been in contact except for hostile texts. The author left for her own safety and well-being. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the mother and family have a right to know about a grandchild, but the author has the right to protect herself and her child from a harmful environment. The family's past behavior (controlling, abusive, religiously oppressive) suggests that they might not be supportive. The author is prioritizing her child's well-being by not exposing them to potentially harmful influences. \n\nAlso, the definition of hiding: if they haven't spoken in months, and the author hasn't initiated contact, maybe it's not hiding. The onus of communication might be on the family, but the author is avoiding conflict for a valid reason. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Family has a right to know. But given the circumstances, the author's decision to protect herself and her child is justified. The guilt she feels is normal, but the wrongness of the family's behavior makes her choice reasonable. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's protecting herself and her child from a harmful situation. The family's actions were the problem, not her decision to withhold information in that context.\n"
