We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The author has a complicated relationship with her family, having run away due to abuse and control. The family is described as very controlling, religious, and potentially abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family isn't in regular contact; they only reach out occasionally to scream at her. The author left because of the abuse, so there's a history of toxic behavior. She's now in a stable relationship and is pregnant. The question is whether she's wrong for not telling her family.\n\nThe key points here are the family's behavior and the author's reasons for not informing them. The family is not supportive based on past interactions. The author is scared of their reaction, which could be harmful. She also doesn't want her child to be exposed to that same environment. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't obligated to share life events with people who have been abusive and uninvolved. The family hasn't made an effort to maintain a healthy relationship. The author's decision to protect herself and her child from potential harm is a valid reason. \n\nThe guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations, but given the circumstances, her choice is justified. The answer should be B (not in the wrong) because her actions are protective measures based on past trauma and ongoing unsupportive family dynamics.\n"
