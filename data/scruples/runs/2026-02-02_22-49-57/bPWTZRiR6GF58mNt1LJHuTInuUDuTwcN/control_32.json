We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. \n\nFirst, the situation: She's 37 weeks pregnant, hasn't told her family. They don't speak much except for occasional hostile texts. She ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive family. Mom is described as a narcissist, and the family is religious, controlling, invasive. They controlled her life, read her phone, etc. Now she's in a stable relationship and is pregnant, but scared of telling her family. She's worried they'll react badly, judge her for being unmarried, and the child might face the same treatment. She's unsure if not telling them is hiding the truth, but since they haven't spoken in months, maybe it's not hiding. She's also worried her child might not get to meet them or might be treated poorly.\n\nSo the question is, is she in the wrong for not telling? \n\nThe key points here are the nature of her relationship with her family. If they were supportive and she had a normal relationship, maybe there's an expectation to tell them. But in her case, the family is abusive, controlling, and estranged. She left because of the abuse, so continuing the estrangement makes sense. The fact that they haven't spoken except for occasional hostile messages suggests that maintaining contact is harmful. \n\nHer decision not to tell them could be seen as protecting herself and her child from potential abuse or negativity. The mother's potential reaction could be harmful, both to her and the child. If the family is religious and judgmental about being unmarried, they might blame her for the pregnancy, which could lead to emotional harm. Also, the child might be exposed to a toxic environment if they meet the family. \n\nThe user is conflicted because she feels guilty, but her reasons for not telling are rooted in past trauma and fear of future harm. In such cases, the priority is personal safety and well-being. The fact that she hasn't told them isn't necessarily hiding if there's no meaningful contact. The family isn't part of her life anymore, so withholding information isn't deceitful in the same way. \n\nSo, considering all this, it seems the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a choice to protect herself and her child from a harmful family dynamic. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
