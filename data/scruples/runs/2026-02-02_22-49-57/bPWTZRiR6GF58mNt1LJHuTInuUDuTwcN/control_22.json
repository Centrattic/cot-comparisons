We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. From the story, their family is described as very controlling and abusive. The mother is a narcissist, the grandfather runs a cult-like family, and they were extremely controlling. The person ran away at 20 because of that. Now they're pregnant with their boyfriend's child and haven't told their biological family.\n\nSo, the question is whether they're in the wrong for not informing their mom. First, I need to consider the context of their relationship. If they've been estranged except for occasional hostile contact, then maybe not telling isn't wrong. The family's behavior seems toxic and harmful. The person left due to abuse, so maintaining any contact is already a stretch. \n\nThey're afraid of how the family would react\u2014probably negative, judgmental, maybe even trying to control the situation. The mother might accuse them of hiding it, but if there's no real communication, then the onus isn't really on the person to share. Also, the person is worried about their child being treated the same way they were. It's understandable to want to protect their child from that environment.\n\nThe boyfriend hasn't pressured them to tell, which suggests he supports their decision. So, the person is in a vulnerable position, and their decision is based on protecting themselves and their child. Legally, there's no obligation to inform family unless there's a court order or something, which isn't mentioned here. \n\nIn terms of moral or social wrongs, if the family isn't part of their life, then keeping the pregnancy private isn't unethical. They have the right to make choices about their own body and their child's upbringing without coercion from an abusive family. The guilt might come from societal expectations, but in this case, the family's toxic behavior justifies the decision. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons rooted in protecting their own well-being and their child's from a harmful family dynamic.\n"
