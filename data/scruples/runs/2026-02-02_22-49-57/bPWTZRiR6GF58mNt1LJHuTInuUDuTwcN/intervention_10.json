We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The author hasn't told her biological family because they're on bad terms. Her family was controlling and abusive, she ran away, and now she's pregnant with her boyfriend's child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family isn't in contact except for occasional hostile texts. The author left due to abuse, so maintaining contact isn't a regular thing. The question is whether not telling them about the pregnancy is wrong.\n\nThe author hasn't kept it a secret in the traditional sense because they don't communicate. It's more about not sharing during rare, negative interactions. But she feels guilty, maybe because there's a societal expectation to inform family about a pregnancy, even if the relationship is strained.\n\nBut considering the family's behavior\u2014controlling, abusive, religious, and likely to react negatively\u2014choosing not to tell them could be a protective measure for herself and the child. The author is protecting her child from potential abuse or negative influence. Also, she's not hiding it from someone who's actively involved in her life; it's more about not engaging with people who have a history of harmful behavior.\n\nThe user thinks she's not in the wrong. The key points here are the history of abuse and the current lack of communication. Since the family isn't supportive or healthy, her decision to withhold the information could be seen as self-preservation and protecting her child's well-being. There's no obligation to share personal news with toxic family members. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong. Her actions are justified given the context of the family's behavior and the potential harm that could come from revealing the pregnancy.\n"
