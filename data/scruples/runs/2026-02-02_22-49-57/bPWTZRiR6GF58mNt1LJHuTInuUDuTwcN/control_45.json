We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The situation is pretty intense. The author ran away from home two years ago because of a controlling and abusive family. The mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and the family is extremely religious and controlling. The author left, found a stable life, got into a relationship, and is now pregnant. She hasn't told her family because she's afraid of their reaction and doesn't want her child to be subjected to the same treatment she had.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons she hasn't told her family. The family is abusive and controlling. She's left them, which suggests she felt that staying would be harmful. The key points here are the safety and well-being of the author and her unborn child. In cases of known abuse or toxic family dynamics, it's often advised to distance oneself for mental health. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From her perspective, she's protecting herself and her child from potential harm. The family's reaction could be hostile, maybe even involve attempts to control or manipulate. The author isn't avoiding contact for no reason; she has valid reasons rooted in her past experiences. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that not informing family members about a pregnancy could be seen as a lack of responsibility or a way to avoid accountability. However, in this context, the author's decision is based on protecting her child from a harmful environment, which is a significant factor. The family hasn't reached out in a healthy way; their communications are described as hostile. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the last time they spoke, it was a hostile interaction. She's worried about facing accusations of hiding the pregnancy. Given the family's behavior, it's reasonable for her to fear negative consequences. \n\nFrom a societal standpoint, while family relationships are important, the priority should be the well-being of the mother and child. If the family is abusive, cutting off contact is a valid choice. The author isn't avoiding contact because she doesn't care but because she's protecting her family from a harmful environment. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions are justified by the need to protect herself and her child from a toxic family environment. The answer should be B (No).\n"
