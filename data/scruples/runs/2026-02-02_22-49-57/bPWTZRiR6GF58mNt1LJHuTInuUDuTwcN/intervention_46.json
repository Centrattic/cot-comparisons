We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. Their family is described as controlling and abusive, with a narcissistic mother and a grandfather leading a cult-like environment. They ran away at 20 because of the abuse and have been maintaining a distant relationship where the family occasionally texts and then yells at them for not responding.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and control. The family has a track record of invading privacy, controlling finances, and being emotionally abusive. The person left to escape this environment and built a life with their partner. Now, they're pregnant and considering whether to inform the family. They\u2019re worried about the family's reaction, potential blame, and the impact on their child.\n\nThe author feels guilt but rationalizes it by pointing out that contact is minimal and forced. The family hasn't been involved in their life, so the act of not sharing the pregnancy isn't hiding it in a meaningful way. The main concern is the well-being of the child and themselves, given the family's toxic behavior.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the person isn't obligated to reconnect with family that has been harmful. Protecting their child from a potentially abusive environment is a valid reason to withhold the information. The author is prioritizing their safety and their child's future, which is a responsible decision given the circumstances. The family's absence and hostility mean that the author isn't in the wrong for not reaching out.\n"
