We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. Let me start by reading through the question again to understand the context.\n\nThe author is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. They haven't been on speaking terms except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. She ran away from home two years ago because her family was controlling and abusive. Her mom is a narcissist, and her grandfather is controlling the family like a cult. They were extremely religious and controlled her life, invading her privacy. Now she's in a stable relationship and pregnant but hasn't told her family. Her boyfriend isn't pressuring her, but she feels guilty. She's scared of their reaction, possible harassment, and how they might treat her future child. She's worried the baby might resent her for keeping the family away. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of her relationship with her family. If they haven't been in contact except for occasional negative texts, maybe she's not obligated to reach out. The family was abusive and controlling, which might make keeping the pregnancy secret a protective measure. She's protecting herself and her child from potential harm. On the other hand, some might argue that she has a duty to inform the biological grandparents about the grandchild. But given the context of abuse, is that a valid expectation?\n\nIn many cases, family responsibilities can be nuanced, especially when there's a history of abuse. The author has left the abusive environment, which shows she prioritized her well-being. Continuing to cut off contact if they're toxic is reasonable. The fear of their reaction and how they might treat her child is a valid concern. If the family is likely to criticize her for being unmarried or to be harmful to the child, withholding that information could be a way to protect both herself and her child.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the child's right to know their family. But if the family is a source of harm, maybe it's better to shield the child from that. The author might be making a difficult choice for the sake of her child's future. So, considering all factors, it seems like she's not in the wrong. Her decision is based on self-protection and protecting her child from an abusive environment. The answer should be B.\n"
