We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is about 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told any of her biological family. They aren't on speaking terms except for occasional texts that turn into screaming matches. She ran away from home two years ago when she was 20 because her family was controlling and abusive. Her mom is described as narcissistic, and her grandfather runs the family like a cult with extreme religious views. They controlled her life tightly, invaded her privacy, and she left to find independence. Now she's in a stable relationship and pregnant. Her boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell her family. She's feeling guilty for hiding it but questions if it's really hiding since they don't talk much. She's scared of their reaction, potential criticism for being unmarried, and also worries about her future child being treated the same way. She's scared her child might hate her for not having contact with the family. She's asking if she's in the wrong for not telling them.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse, control, and the lack of communication. The family hasn't been supportive or kind, and their interactions are hostile. The author left home to escape that environment. Now, she's in a better place but is conflicted about whether she should inform her family. The dilemma is between her fear of their reaction and guilt about keeping it a secret.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, I think the main consideration is the well-being of the author and her child. If the family is abusive and controlling, it's understandable she wouldn't want to involve them. The fact that they haven't spoken much and their interactions are negative complicates things. The author is protecting herself and her future child from potential harm. The guilt she feels is valid, but it's also important to prioritize safety and mental health. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if the family is not supportive and has been abusive, the author isn't obligated to inform them. The responsibility to maintain family ties can be outweighed by the need for personal safety and emotional health. The fact that her boyfriend hasn't pressured her suggests he supports her decision, which is a good sign. Also, the fear of how her child might be treated if introduced to the family is a legitimate concern. \n\nI don't see the author as being in the wrong here. Her decision is based on past trauma and the desire to protect her child from a harmful environment. The question of \"hiding\" it becomes tricky since they don't communicate, but even if they did, the risk of negative reactions is present. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
