We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the author has a strained relationship with her family. She ran away from home at 20 because of a very controlling and abusive family environment. Her mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is extremely religious, controlling, and invasive. They don't speak often, only when they reach out to yell at her. \n\nNow, she's pregnant, 37 weeks along, and hasn't told her family. She's conflicted because she feels guilty but is terrified of their reaction. She's worried they'll criticize her for being unmarried, and she's also concerned about her child potentially facing the same treatment she did. Her boyfriend hasn't pushed her to tell them, but she's struggling with the decision.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, the key points here are the history of abuse and control. The family isn't a supportive environment. The author has valid reasons to fear their reaction. They haven't been in regular contact, so maybe not telling them isn't a betrayal in the traditional sense. She's also considering her child's well-being, not wanting them exposed to harmful dynamics.\n\nFrom an external perspective, the author isn't obligated to inform people who have been abusive and uninvolved in her life. The responsibility to maintain a relationship isn't on her, especially after she left an abusive situation. The fact that they haven't reached out except to yell suggests they aren't supportive. Therefore, her decision to keep it private might be a form of self-protection and protecting her child. \n\nHowever, some might argue that there's a duty to inform family members about a grandchild. But given the circumstances, especially the abusive history, that duty might not exist. The author's mental health and the child's well-being are priorities here. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's acting in her own and her child's best interest given the family's history. The question of AITA isn't about the act of not telling, but the context in which it's done. The family's behavior absolves her of wrongdoing in this scenario.\n"
