We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The author hasn't told her family because they have a bad relationship. She ran away from home due to abuse and control. The family is described as controlling, religious, and abusive. She left for her safety and well-being.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abuse and the current lack of communication. The author isn't in contact with her family except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. The question is whether not informing them about her pregnancy is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. If someone is in an abusive family situation, they have the right to prioritize their safety and their child's well-being. The author has a valid reason for not wanting to tell them due to the potential negative reaction\u2014like criticism for being unmarried, possible further control, or harm to the child. The fact that the family hasn't been in consistent contact also plays a role. If they haven't been speaking, the author isn't necessarily hiding the pregnancy from active communication.\n\nHowever, some might argue that family has a right to know about a grandchild. But in this case, the family isn't supportive, so the author's decision is more about protecting herself and her child. The author mentions fear for her child's future treatment, which is a valid concern given the family's behavior. Also, the boyfriend isn't pressuring her to tell, which suggests he supports her choice.\n\nI think the main factors are the history of abuse, lack of current communication, and the potential negative impact of informing them. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Her priority is her safety and her child's, which is appropriate. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
