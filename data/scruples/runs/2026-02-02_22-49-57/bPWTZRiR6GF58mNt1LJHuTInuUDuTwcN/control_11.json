We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author left her family two years ago due to controlling and abusive behavior. Her mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is very religious, controlling, and invasive. She's now pregnant with her boyfriend's child and hasn't told her family. The main question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing them.\n\nFrom what I read, the family hasn't been supportive. They only contact her occasionally to scream at her. She left because of abuse. So, not telling them might be a protective measure for herself and her child. The guilt she feels might come from societal expectations, but her circumstances are different. The family isn't in her life, so maybe it's not her responsibility to keep them informed. Also, considering the potential negative reaction and the well-being of her child, choosing not to tell might be a valid decision. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her, so there's no external pressure from him. The key points are the abusive environment, the lack of communication, and her right to protect herself and her child. So, probably the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
