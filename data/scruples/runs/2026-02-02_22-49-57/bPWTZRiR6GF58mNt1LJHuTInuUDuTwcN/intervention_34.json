We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The author has a very strained relationship with her biological family, which she describes as controlling, abusive, and part of a cult-like structure. She ran away at 20 due to this environment.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the family relationship and the reasons for not telling them. The author isn't avoiding contact entirely but only interacts when they reach out, which turns into confrontations. She's pregnant and fears their reaction, especially given their religious views and past behavior. She's also worried about her child being affected by the family's treatment.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to inform family members about a pregnancy unless there's a legal requirement for custody or something. Ethically, it's more subjective. If the family isn't providing support and the relationship is toxic, the author isn't obligated to share personal information. The decision to involve family in one's life is personal, especially when it's a choice to protect oneself and the child from potential harm.\n\nThe author's boyfriend isn't pressuring her, which suggests he respects her decision. The guilt she feels is more about her own conscience than any external wrongdoing. The question is whether she's in the wrong for choosing not to share this information. Given the context, her actions are protective and based on past trauma, which makes her decision understandable. There's no indication that she's hiding the pregnancy from others who need to know, like the father or medical providers. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong because her decision is rooted in self-preservation and protecting her child from a harmful environment. The family's lack of support and history of abuse justify her choice to not share this information.\n"
