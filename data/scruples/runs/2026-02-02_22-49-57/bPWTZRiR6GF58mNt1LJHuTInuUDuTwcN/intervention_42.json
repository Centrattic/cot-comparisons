We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for not telling their mom they're pregnant. They have a complicated relationship with their family, who were controlling and abusive. They ran away at 20 and haven't had good contact since. The family only reaches out to yell at them.\n\nSo, the key points here are the family's behavior. The person describes their mom as a narcissistic parent and a controlling family environment. They left because of mental abuse and control. Now they're pregnant and considering not telling their family. The question is whether not telling them makes them the \"asshole.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definition of \"in the wrong.\" If the family is abusive, then not contacting them might be a protective measure. The person isn't in communication with them except for occasional hostile messages. If the family is toxic, then keeping their pregnancy a secret could be a way to protect themselves and the child from potential harm. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that a parent has a right to know about their grandchild. But given the history of abuse and control, the author is justified in being cautious. The answer depends on the context of the relationship. If the family is not supportive and has a history of being harmful, then withholding information isn't necessarily wrong. The author is prioritizing their well-being and their child's safety. \n\nAlso, the author mentions fear of the family's reaction, including disapproval of being unmarried and potential harm to the child. Those are valid concerns. The decision to not inform them might be a way to prevent further conflict and protect future generations from the same treatment. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. Their choice is based on self-preservation and protecting their child from a toxic environment. The answer should be B, meaning they're not in the wrong.\n"
