We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. Let me start by reading through the situation again to get all the details.\n\nThe author is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. They don't speak except for occasional texts that turn into screaming. She ran away from home at 20 because of a controlling, abusive family. Her mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult. They were extremely controlling and invasive in her life. Now she's stable, in a happy relationship, and pregnant. She feels guilty for not telling them but is scared of their reaction, especially since they might react negatively because she's unmarried. She's also worried about how her child might be treated if they meet the family. She's considering whether keeping it a secret is hiding, but they haven't talked in months. She's torn between guilt and fear.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics between the author and her family. They have a history of abuse and control. The family's behavior is toxic, and the author left to escape that. If she tells them, they might react with anger, try to control her, or be abusive. The mother is narcissistic, so she might take it personally, maybe blame the author for not being in a marriage, and that could escalate the conflict. The grandfather's cult-like control suggests they might try to involve the child in their religion or control aspects of the child's life. The author is protecting both herself and her child from potential harm.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mother has a right to know about her grandchild. But given the history, the author has valid reasons to protect her child from a harmful environment. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not informing her mother. \n\nThe key points here are the abusive family environment, the author's right to safety and autonomy, and the potential harm to the child. The author is not keeping it a secret in a context of healthy communication but is avoiding contact with a family that has been harmful. In such cases, prioritizing one's safety and the child's well-being is reasonable. The fact that the family hasn't reached out in months (only occasional texts that turn into harassment) means that the author isn't hiding the pregnancy in a context where the family is actively involved. It's not \"hiding\" if there's no meaningful connection.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong. She's making a choice based on self-preservation and protecting her child from potential abuse. The answer should be B.\n"
