We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The situation is that the family isn't on speaking terms, there's a history of abuse and control. The author left home due to a controlling environment, and now she's pregnant but hasn't told her family. They occasionally contact her and scream at her when they do. She's worried about their reaction, the potential harm to her child, and feels guilty but also terrified.\n\nFirst, consider the context of the family dynamics. The family is described as abusive, controlling, and toxic. The mother is narcissistic, the grandfather runs the family like a cult. The author had to run away at 20 because of this. In such cases, cutting off contact is often a necessary step for self-preservation. The author hasn't initiated contact, only the family does, and even then, it's hostile. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong for not telling them. The key points here are the nature of the relationship. If someone is in an abusive situation, they're not obligated to maintain contact or share personal news. Especially when the other party is hostile and has a history of abuse. The author's decision not to contact them is a protective measure both for herself and her unborn child. \n\nAlso, the user mentions the boyfriend hasn't pressured her, which shows her partner respects her boundaries. The fear of the family's reaction is valid, and the potential harm to the child from being exposed to such a toxic environment is a legitimate concern. The author is prioritizing her child's safety and her own well-being by keeping it secret. \n\nThere's a sense of guilt mentioned, which is common in such situations. But guilt doesn't necessarily equate to being in the wrong. The family isn't maintaining a healthy relationship; they're the ones creating conflict. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy; she's withholding information from people who are not part of her life and are hostile when they enter. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while some might expect you to inform family of a pregnancy, when the family is toxic and harmful, those expectations don't apply. The priority is the safety and well-being of the mother and child. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Her actions are a form of self-protection and protection of her unborn child. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
