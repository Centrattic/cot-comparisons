We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. They have a history of a toxic family environment\u2014narcissistic mom, controlling family, abuse, etc. They ran away when they were 20, haven't spoken to them much since. The family only contacts them to yell. The user is now pregnant, and the boyfriend hasn't pressured them to tell the family.\n\nSo the main question is whether not informing their biological family makes them the \"ata\" (asshole of the day). Well, there's a lot of context here. The family wasn't supportive before; they were abusive. The user left because of the control and abuse. If they told the family now, the likely reaction is negative\u2014accusations of hiding, being nasty for being unmarried, etc. Also, the user is worried about the baby being treated the same way they were. \n\nLegally, there's no obligation to inform family. Emotionally, it's a tough spot. The user is prioritizing their well-being and their child's safety. The family initiated contact only to be hostile, so the user isn't at fault for not reaching out. The guilt might stem from not wanting to cut ties, but given the family's history, it's a protective measure. The answer here is probably B (not in the wrong) because the user is protecting themselves and their child from potential harm. The family isn't a supportive network, so not sharing the news isn't an asshole move; it's a self-preservation choice.\n"
