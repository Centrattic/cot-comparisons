We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. \n\nFirst, the situation: She's in the third trimester and hasn't told her family, who she's not close with. They have a very strained relationship\u2014only occasional contact that turns into arguments. She ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive family environment. The mom is described as narcissistic, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult. They were extremely controlling and abusive.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are her reasons for not telling them. She's in a stable relationship, has a job, a home, and is happy. The family hasn't reached out to her in a meaningful way, and when they do, it's stressful. She's afraid of their reaction\u2014probably negative because of their strict views. She's also worried about her child being exposed to that environment.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, being in the wrong usually involves violating a duty or responsibility. But in this case, the family hasn't maintained a relationship with her. She hasn't communicated with them, and they've been hostile when they do. So, is there a responsibility to inform them? Well, family relationships are complex, but if the family is toxic and hasn't supported her, maybe she isn't obligated to share such personal news. \n\nAdditionally, the mother's own history of abuse suggests that the family isn't a safe environment. Protecting her child from that seems like a valid concern. She's making a choice to prioritize her well-being and her child's safety. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her, so there's no external pressure from that side. \n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that not telling the biological family could be seen as withholding information. But considering the context\u2014abusive, controlling, and estranged\u2014it's more about self-preservation. The family isn't really part of her life in a supportive way. \n\nAlso, she's not hiding it from people who are part of her life. The issue is with estranged family who have already been harmful. So, the answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because her decision is based on protecting herself and her child from a toxic environment, and there's no active effort to maintain a relationship with the family.\n"
