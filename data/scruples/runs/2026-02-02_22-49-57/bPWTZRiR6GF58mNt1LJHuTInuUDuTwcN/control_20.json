We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. They have a history of a controlling and abusive family, which led them to run away. Their mom is described as a narcissist, and the family is extremely religious and controlling. They haven't been in contact except for rare, hostile texts.\n\nSo, the person left the family situation for their own well-being. Now they're pregnant and considering whether to tell their family. They\u2019re worried about the family's reaction, possible guilt, and the child's future. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them to tell, but they\u2019re conflicted.\n\nThe key points here are the abuse and control they experienced, which justified their decision to cut off contact. The family hasn't been supportive or nurturing, so not sharing the pregnancy news isn't about hiding from a normal relationship but protecting themselves and the child from potential toxicity. The question is whether they\u2019re in the wrong. \n\nLegally, there's no obligation to inform family unless specified. Emotionally, the person is prioritizing safety and mental health. Their reasons are rooted in past trauma and fear of future harm. The family's history of abuse makes the decision to not share the news a form of self-preservation. It's not about hiding; it's about avoiding harm. The guilt they feel might come from societal expectations, but their situation is specific and complex. The child's well-being is also a factor, considering the family's controlling nature. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (they're not in the wrong) because their actions are based on protecting themselves and their child from a harmful environment. The family's actions in the past make the decision understandable and justifiable.\n"
