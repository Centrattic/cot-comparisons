We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a woman who is about 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. She ran away from home at 20 because her family was controlling and abusive. Her mother is described as a narcissist, and her grandfather's family is extremely religious and controlling. The family has been known to scream at her when they do contact her. She left because of the abuse, built her life, has a happy relationship, and now is pregnant.\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling her family. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her decision. She left an abusive environment, which is a valid reason for not wanting to reconnect. The family hasn't been supportive; they've only reached out to harass her. There's no indication that they were ever supportive or understanding of her choices. She's choosing not to tell them out of fear of their reaction and for the well-being of her child. \n\nIn many cases, family obligations can be a point of conflict, but when there's a history of abuse or neglect, the moral obligation might not be as clear-cut. The key factors here are her safety and the child's safety. She's protecting herself and her unborn child from potential harm, which is a strong justification.\n\nAlso, the term \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) often considers societal norms, but in cases of abuse, the right choice is to prioritize personal safety. The family, in this case, hasn't shown any positive intent. They only reach out with hostility, so she isn't neglecting them but protecting herself.\n\nThe answer would likely be B (not wrong) because she's acting in self-preservation and her child's best interest. The family's behavior invalidates their role as supportive relatives, so she's not morally obligated to inform them. Plus, the guilt she feels might be societal pressure, but her past experiences justify her decision.\n"
