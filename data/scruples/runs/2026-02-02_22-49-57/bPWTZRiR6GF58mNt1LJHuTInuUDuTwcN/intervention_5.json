We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is that the author has a very strained relationship with her family. She ran away from home because of controlling and abusive parents. Now she's pregnant, living her own life, and hasn't told her family because she's scared of their reaction and what they might do to her or her child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author left an abusive environment. Her family is described as controlling, with a narcissistic mother and a grandfather who runs the family like a cult. They were invading her privacy, controlling her finances, and so on. She's been independent for two years, has a stable relationship, and is now pregnant. She hasn't been in contact with her family except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong for not informing her mother. The key points here are the reason for not telling\u2014abuse, control, fear of how they'll react versus the obligation to inform family. But in this case, the family isn't part of her life anymore. They haven't had a healthy relationship. The author is protecting herself and her child from potential harm. \n\nLegally, parents have rights, but if there's no custody or contact, maybe not. But ethically, it's more about the relationship. The author isn't avoiding a close family relationship; she's avoiding a toxic and harmful one. She's also considering the child's well-being, not wanting the child to be exposed to the same treatment. \n\nThe dilemma is between her fear of confrontation and the guilt of not informing. But given the family's behavior, staying away is a form of self-preservation. The answer depends on whether the family has a right to be in her child's life, but since she hasn't had contact, maybe they forfeited that right. \n\nAlso, the fact that the family reaches out but in a hostile way. She doesn't initiate contact, which is a red flag for toxic relationships. So, the author's decision to not tell them is understandable. The guilt she feels is valid, but the trauma and control she experienced justify her choice. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's protecting herself and her child from potential harm, and the family's behavior doesn't support a healthy relationship. The responsibility to inform might exist in a normal relationship, but this isn't a normal situation.\n"
