We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. The background is that their family is really controlling and abusive. They left home at 20 because of the abuse. Now they're 37 weeks pregnant, in a stable relationship, and the family doesn't talk except for occasional hostile texts.\n\nThe key points here: The family isn't on speaking terms. The author hasn't contacted them; the family initiates contact but it's negative. The mom is described as a narcissist, and the family is controlling and religious. The author left due to abuse and now has a child. They're scared that if they tell, the family will react badly, blame them, and possibly harm their child. They're also worried about their child not knowing the family and how they'd treat her.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the family isn't part of their life. They haven't had a healthy relationship. The person isn't in contact with them. In that case, not sharing the pregnancy might not be in the wrong. The duty to inform family is usually there if there's a relationship. But here, the family isn't part of their life. The author has left due to abuse. The fear of negative reaction is valid, especially given the family's history. The decision to not tell them could be protective for both the author and the child. So, the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
