We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is that the author has a very toxic family. They were controlling, abusive, and she ran away at 20. Now she's 37 weeks pregnant, in a happy relationship, and hasn't told her family. She's feeling guilty but also afraid of their reaction.\n\nSo, the main points here are the family's behavior, the author's safety and well-being, and the baby's future. The family is described as narcissistic, controlling, and religious to an extreme. They've invaded her privacy, controlled her finances, and her boyfriend hasn't pushed her to tell them. The author is scared of their reaction, possible harassment, and how they might treat her baby.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if not telling her family makes her at fault. In many cases, people have the right to choose who they share personal information with, especially if there's a history of abuse. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from a close, communicative family but from estranged, abusive relatives. The fact that they only contact her occasionally to scream at her suggests a hostile relationship. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the child's well-being. The author fears her family might treat the baby the same way she was treated. That's a valid concern. If the family is likely to be hostile or judgmental, withholding that information could be protective. The author is prioritizing the child's safety and her own mental health, which are important factors.\n\nLegal aspects might come into play too. Depending on the country, there might be laws about informing family members about grandchildren, but in many places, the parent has the right to make such decisions. The key here is the abusive nature of the family. Courts often consider the child's best interest, and if the family is a risk, the parent's choice to limit contact might be justified.\n\nThe author isn't avoiding contact altogether but is in a position where the family initiates contact only to be hostile. She's not hiding the pregnancy from someone who is a supportive part of her life but from people who have been harmful. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations, but her personal safety and the child's future are paramount.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Her decision is based on protecting herself and her child from a harmful environment. The answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
