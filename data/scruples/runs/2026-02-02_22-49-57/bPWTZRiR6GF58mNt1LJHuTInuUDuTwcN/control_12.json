We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. Their family isn't on speaking terms, only communicating through rare, hostile texts. The user ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive family environment. The mom is described as narcissistic, and the grandfather as leading a cult-like family with extreme religious control. The user is now in a stable relationship, has a job, and is pregnant. They feel guilt about not informing their family but are scared of their reaction and the potential harm to their child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the relationship. The user hasn't been in contact with their family except for occasional hostile texts. In such cases, the responsibility of maintaining contact isn't on the person who left an abusive situation. The family's behavior is toxic and controlling, so the user's decision to cut off isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nNext, the user's fear of how the family would react is valid. Given the history of abuse and control, the family might react with anger, blame the user, or harm the child. The user is protecting themselves and their unborn child from potential harm. \n\nThe question of whether it's hiding is tricky. Since there's no regular communication, the user isn't actively hiding it in the traditional sense. The family hasn't been part of their life, so not sharing the news isn't deceitful in this context. \n\nThe user's guilt might stem from societal expectations about family, but in cases of abuse, those norms might not apply. The priority here is the well-being of the user and the child. The decision to not inform the family is a self-preservation strategy, which is understandable and not inherently wrong. \n\nAlso, considering the child's future, the user is concerned about the child being subjected to the same treatment. By keeping the family unaware, the user is protecting the child from potential harm, which is a responsible action. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a choice based on their past experiences to protect themselves and their child from a toxic family environment.\n"
