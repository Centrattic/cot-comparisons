We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The author is around 37 weeks pregnant, hasn't told her biological family, and they don't really speak except for occasional hostile texts. She ran away from home two years ago due to controlling and abusive family. The mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is controlling, religious, and pushy. The author is with a boyfriend now, who hasn't pressured her to tell her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family is abusive and controlling. The author left because of mental abuse and the family's control over her life. She's in a stable job, home, and a happy relationship. The main question is whether not telling her family about the pregnancy makes her in the wrong.\n\nThe key factors here are the nature of the relationship with the family. If the family is abusive and has a history of controlling behavior, then the author has valid reasons to avoid contact. The concept of AITA (Am I the Asshole) often hinges on societal norms versus personal circumstances. In many cases, people might judge based on traditional family expectations, like keeping family informed about such a significant life event. However, the author's reasoning is that the family would react negatively, potentially harming both her and the child. She's also worried about the child growing up without the other side of the family, but she's concerned about the treatment the child might receive.\n\nThe definition of \"in the wrong\" here might depend on intent. The author isn't keeping the secret to be malicious but to avoid harm. If there's a lack of contact and the family isn't part of her life, maybe it's not her responsibility to inform them. On the other hand, some might argue that family has a right to know about a grandchild. However, in abusive situations, prioritizing safety and well-being is often supported.\n\nI need to check if the author has any obligations here. If the family was disengaged and she's not in contact, then it's not necessarily her fault. Also, considering the potential for negative reactions, her decision to protect herself and the child is understandable. The question is whether society would consider her in the wrong. In many cases, people are more understanding of such situations, especially with abuse involved. So the answer is likely B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
