We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The story details a family that was extremely controlling and abusive, leading her to leave home at 20. The family hasn't been in touch except for occasional screaming texts. The author is now pregnant and considering whether to tell her family.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The family is described as abusive, with a narcissistic mother and a grandfather running the family like a cult. The author left because of the control and abuse. The family doesn't communicate except to yell at her. Given this history, it's understandable she's fearful of their reaction to her pregnancy.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong for not informing them. The key factors here are the nature of the relationship, the potential harm from informing them, and the author's right to protect herself and her child. \n\nIf the family is hostile, controlling, and abusive, keeping the pregnancy a secret might be a protective measure. There's no obligation to maintain contact with family that is toxic. The author chose to distance herself for her own well-being and that of her child. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations or internal conflict, but the reality of the family dynamics justifies her decision. \n\nAlso, the author is not hiding the pregnancy from people who are actively involved in her life. Since communication is minimal and hostile, not sharing this news isn't hiding it from a close family unit. Her priority is her safety and her child's, which is a valid reason. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
