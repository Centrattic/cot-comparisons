We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. She's 37 weeks along, and she hasn't told her biological family. The family isn't on speaking terms except for occasional texts that turn into yelling. She ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling and abusive environment. Her mom is a narcissist, and her grandfather runs the family like a cult with extreme religious control. They were very invasive with her life, controlling her car mileage, bank account, and privacy. Now she's in a stable relationship and pregnant, but she's scared to tell them. Her boyfriend hasn't pressured her. She's feeling guilty but unsure if it's hiding since they don't talk.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the history of abuse and control. The family's behavior is toxic, so her fear of their reaction is valid. The user is asking if she's in the wrong by not telling them. The options are A (yes she is) or B (no she isn't). \n\nIn situations where family is abusive or toxic, the moral obligation to inform them might be lessened. The author's decision not to tell is likely self-protective for herself and her child. The fact that they haven't spoken in a long time and their interactions are hostile supports the idea that she's not obligated to share. Also, considering the potential harm to her child from being exposed to such a family, her decision is protective. \n\nHowever, some might argue that family has a right to know about a grandchild. But in this context, the family isn't supportive, and their reaction could be harmful. The author's reasoning is justified given her past experiences. So, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
