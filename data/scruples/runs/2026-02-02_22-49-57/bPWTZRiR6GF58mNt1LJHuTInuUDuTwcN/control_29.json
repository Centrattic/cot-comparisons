We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The author has a history of a very controlling and abusive family. She ran away at 20 because they were so controlling and mentally abusive. Now she's 37 weeks pregnant, in a stable relationship, and hasn't told her family. She's conflicted between feeling guilty for not telling them and being terrified of their reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The family isn't on speaking terms except for rare, hostile interactions. The author's mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is extremely controlling and religious, to the point of monitoring her every move. The author left because of this abuse. \n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and the current strained relationship. In such cases, maintaining contact with a toxic family can be harmful. The author hasn't made contact; they reach out but in a negative way. The question is about whether she's in the wrong for not disclosing her pregnancy. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, withholding information from family isn't inherently wrong, especially if the family is toxic. The author is protecting herself and her unborn child from potential harm. The family's values might lead them to criticize her for being unmarried and pregnant, potentially affecting the child's upbringing. The author is considering the well-being of both herself and her child, which is a valid concern.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to inform family members about a pregnancy unless there's a court order or custody arrangement, which isn't the case here. Emotionally, she's justified in prioritizing her mental health and her child's safety. The fact that the family hasn't maintained a healthy relationship also plays a role. \n\nThe boyfriend hasn't pressured her, which shows he respects her decision. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations but not from an actual moral wrongdoing given the circumstances. The decision to not tell them is a personal choice made for self-preservation and the child's best interest. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a choice to protect herself and her child from a harmful environment. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
