We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. The situation is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the author left home at 20 due to severe controlling and abusive family dynamics. The mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is extremely religious and controlling. They didn't just have a bad relationship; it's more like a toxic, abusive environment. The author hasn't spoken to them except for rare texts that turn into screaming matches. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them to tell, but the author feels conflicted.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse, the lack of contact, and the fear of how the family would react. The author is worried about being accused of hiding the pregnancy, facing judgment for being unmarried, and the potential harm to their child from the family's influence. They\u2019re also concerned about the child's future interactions with such a harmful family.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to inform family unless there's a court order or something similar, which isn't mentioned here. Ethically, it's more about the author's well-being and the child's. Since the family has a history of abuse and the author has left them, it's understandable they'd want to protect themselves and their child. The mother's reaction could be hostile, and the author isn't in a position to subject their child to that without their consent.\n\nThe author isn't hiding the pregnancy in a deceptive way because there's been no contact. The family hasn't been part of their life for months. The guilt might stem from societal expectations about family, but the actual relationship is toxic. The priority here is safety and well-being, which the author is prioritizing by not informing them. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason to protect themselves and their child from potential harm.\n"
