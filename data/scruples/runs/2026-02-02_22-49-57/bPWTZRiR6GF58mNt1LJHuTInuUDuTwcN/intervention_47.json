We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. The author has a history of a very controlling and abusive family. They ran away at 20 because of that. The family is described as controlling, religious, and abusive, with the mother being a narcissist and the grandfather running the family like a cult.\n\nThe author is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told any of their biological family. They don't have a good relationship; the family only contacts them occasionally with hostile messages. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them to tell, but the author feels conflicted. They're scared of the reaction, potential judgment, and the possibility of their child being affected by the family's behavior.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and the current lack of communication. The author is protecting themselves from potential harm by not disclosing. The family hasn't been supportive, and reaching out is hostile. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I need to agree or disagree.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if someone is in an abusive situation, they have the right to protect themselves and their child. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from a healthy relationship; it's from a harmful one. The family's reaction is likely to be negative and damaging. So, the author's decision not to tell is a form of self-preservation. The guilt they feel might be due to societal expectations, but given the context, it's not their fault for prioritizing their well-being and their child's safety. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
