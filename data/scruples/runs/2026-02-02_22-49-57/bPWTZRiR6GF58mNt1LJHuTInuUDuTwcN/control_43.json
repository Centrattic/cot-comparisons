We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the woman who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is that she's 37 weeks pregnant, hasn't told her family, and they haven't been in contact except for occasional negative texts. She left home at 20 because of a controlling, abusive family. The mom is a narcissist, and the family is very controlling and religious. The woman is scared of how they'll react, potential judgment about being unmarried, and the impact on her child.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are the history of abuse and control. If the family is abusive and she's protecting herself and her child from that, then she's not in the wrong. The question is whether she has an obligation to inform family, even if they've been abusive. \n\nFrom a typical AITA perspective, people often consider the responsibility to family ties, but if the family is toxic, the expectation might be lower. The fact that they haven't been in contact except for harassment suggests that the mother isn't maintaining a healthy relationship. The woman is prioritizing her well-being and her child's safety by not involving an abusive family. \n\nAlso, she's not hiding the pregnancy from someone who has a healthy relationship with her; she's withholding it from people who have a history of abuse. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her, which shows he respects her decision. The guilt she feels might be from societal expectations, but her situation is unique due to the abuse. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she's protecting herself and her child from a harmful environment. There's no obligation to maintain contact with abusive family, and her decision is reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
