We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is that the author left her family two years ago due to controlling and abusive behavior. The family is described as controlling, with a narcissistic mother and a grandfather running a cult-like family. They are extremely religious and push their values. The author hasn't been in contact with them except for occasional texts where they end up being screamed at. Now she's 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her family. She's considering if she's in the wrong for keeping it secret.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if there's a moral obligation to inform parents about a grandchild. In many cultures, there's an expectation to inform family about such a significant life event. However, the context here is crucial. The family has a history of abuse, control, and harassment. The author left because of this toxic environment. The family's behavior is described as invasive and harmful. \n\nThe key points are the abuse the author experienced, the lack of communication, and the potential harm from revealing the pregnancy. The author fears that telling them would lead to accusations of hiding the pregnancy and that they would judge her for being unmarried. She's also worried about her child being affected by the family's treatment. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether the author is obligated to contact a family that has been abusive. Legally, there's no obligation to inform family unless there's a specific reason, like if the parents have legal guardianship or if there's a custody issue. But emotionally and ethically, the situation is more complex. The author's mental health and the child's well-being are at stake. If contacting the family would expose her and the child to further abuse or stress, then it's reasonable to prioritize their safety and well-being. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not informing them. Given the family's history, the author's justification for keeping it secret seems valid. The guilt she feels is natural, but it's important to weigh the potential harm of revealing against the guilt of not telling. Since the family hasn't been involved in her life and their behavior is harmful, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to protect herself and her child from potential negative consequences. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
