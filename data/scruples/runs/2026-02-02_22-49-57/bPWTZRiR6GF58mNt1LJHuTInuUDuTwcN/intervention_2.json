We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is pregnant and hasn't told their biological family, who they have a very strained relationship with. Their family is described as controlling and abusive, with a narcissistic mother and a cult-like grandfather. The family hasn't been in contact except for occasional hostile messages.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling them. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family was abusive and controlling. The person left home at 20 due to this abuse. Now, they have a stable life, a partner, and a child. They're considering not telling the family about the pregnancy. \n\nThe key points here are the nature of the relationship. If the family is actively harmful and the person has cut ties for their own well-being, withholding information might be a form of self-protection. The author mentions fear of negative reactions, potential harassment, and the family's extreme views on marriage and religion. Also, they're worried about their child being subjected to the same treatment.\n\nIn such cases, prioritizing one's mental health and safety is often seen as justified. The concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) usually considers the balance of right and wrong, but in cases of abuse, the survivor's choices are typically viewed as reasonable. \n\nThe family initiated contact with hostility, and the author hasn't reached out. The question is whether not informing them is wrong. Since the family's behavior was abusive, the author isn't in the wrong for protecting themselves and their child from potential harm. \n\nSo the answer is B (No).\n"
