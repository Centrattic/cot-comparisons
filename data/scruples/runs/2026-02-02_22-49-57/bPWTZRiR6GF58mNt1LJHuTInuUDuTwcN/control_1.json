We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her family. They aren't on speaking terms except for rare texts that turn into screaming matches. The family is described as controlling, mentally abusive, with a narcissistic mom and a grandfather who runs the family like a cult. The author left home at 20 due to abuse and now has a stable life with a boyfriend. She's scared her family will react negatively, judge her for being unmarried, and possibly harm her child. She's also worried about her child growing up without that side of the family.\n\nSo, the main points here are the history of abuse and the toxic family dynamics. The author isn't in contact with them, and they only reach out to scream. The question is whether not telling them about the pregnancy makes her wrong. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's often about intent and circumstances. The author's family has been abusive, so contacting them might put her and her child in a harmful situation. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone she's in a healthy relationship with; instead, it's about protecting herself and her child from people who have been abusive. \n\nThere's also the aspect of guilt she feels. She wonders if it's hiding, but if there's no contact, maybe it's not hiding. The family hasn't been supportive, and reaching out could lead to more conflict. The author's priority is her well-being and her child's, which is a valid reason. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family has the right to know about a grandchild. But given the context of abuse and the potential harm, it's a protective measure. The author isn't the one initiating contact; the family does, and their interactions are negative. \n\nSo considering all this, the answer is probably B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong given the abusive environment and her need to protect herself and her child. The decision not to tell is a form of self-preservation and child protection.\n"
