We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The author is 37 weeks pregnant, hasn't told her biological family, and they're not on speaking terms except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. She left home at 20 due to a controlling and abusive family environment. The family is described as controlling, religious, and abusive. The author is now in a stable relationship and is happy but feels conflicted about telling her family. She's scared they'll react negatively, criticize her for being unmarried, and potentially harm her child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the family dynamics. The author left due to abuse and control, so her decision to not reach out is understandable. The question is about whether not informing them about her pregnancy makes her at fault. The key points here are the history of abuse, the lack of a healthy relationship, and the potential harm if she does tell them. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, people have the right to protect themselves from abuse and control. If the author believes that informing her family could lead to harassment, criticism, or harm to her or her child, then not telling them isn't wrong. The fact that they haven't spoken in a long time and only contact her to scream at her suggests that the family isn't supportive. \n\nThe author is also considering the child's future, worried that the family might treat the child poorly. In this case, prioritizing the child's well-being by not exposing them to a toxic environment is a valid concern. The decision to not share the pregnancy is more about self-preservation and protecting her child rather than hiding information in a healthy relationship. \n\nHowever, some might argue that there's a moral obligation to inform family members about such a significant life event. But that obligation is typically present in a healthy, supportive relationship. In this case, the family isn't supportive, so the author isn't obligated. The guilt she feels is likely due to societal expectations rather than actual wrongdoing. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Her decision is based on self-protection and protecting her child from a harmful environment. The answer should be B.\n"
