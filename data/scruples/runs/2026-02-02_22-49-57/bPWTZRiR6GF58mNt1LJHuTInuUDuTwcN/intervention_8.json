We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for not telling their mom they're pregnant. Their family is described as controlling, abusive, and religious. They ran away at 20 because of the abuse. Now they're pregnant, have a stable life, and are with someone who makes them happy.\n\nThe main points here are the history of abuse and the current family dynamic. The family is only in contact through occasional texts that turn into yelling. The person is worried about the reaction if they tell them about the pregnancy, especially since the mom is narcissistic and the grandfather is controlling. They're also worried about their future child being affected by the family.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing. Well, if the family hasn't been involved in their life and has been abusive, it's not necessarily the author's responsibility to inform them. They have a right to protect themselves and their child from potential harm. The family's lack of contact and history of abuse justify the author's decision to keep it private. Plus, the author's safety and well-being are important. They might be feeling guilty because they think they should share, but given the circumstances, it's reasonable not to. So the answer is probably B.\n"
