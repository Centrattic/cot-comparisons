We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The author is 37 weeks along and hasn't told her biological family, who she hasn't been in touch with except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. The family is described as controlling and abusive, with a narcissistic mother and a grandfather who runs the family like a cult. The author left home at 20 because of the abuse.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for keeping her pregnancy a secret from her family. Let's break this down. On one hand, there's the idea that family should be informed about a grandchild. But on the other hand, the author has a history of severe abuse and control from her family. She's afraid of how they'll react\u2014maybe they'll blame her for being unmarried, which is common in some religious groups. Also, she's worried about her child being exposed to the same toxic environment she had.\n\nThe key points here are the safety and well-being of the author and her child. If the family is abusive and controlling, contacting them could put the author and her baby at risk. The author has already left such an environment to start a better life. She doesn't want her child to suffer the same treatment. Also, the fact that the family reaches out only to harass her suggests that maintaining contact isn't healthy.\n\nThere's also the aspect of guilt. The author feels guilty for hiding the pregnancy, but she's not hiding it in the traditional sense because there's no contact. The family hasn't been part of her life, so how can she be hiding it from them if they don't communicate? The guilt might be from societal expectations, but her personal circumstances are different.\n\nThe boyfriend hasn't pressured her, which supports her decision to wait or not tell. Her reasons are rooted in self-protection and her child's protection. The decision to not tell her family is about safeguarding her new life and her child's future. In this context, it's understandable and justified. The author is prioritizing her mental health and her child's safety over potential family obligations. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for making that choice.\n"
