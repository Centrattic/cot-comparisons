We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is that the author left her family two years ago because they were controlling and abusive. Now she's pregnant with her boyfriend's child and hasn't told her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family was abusive, controlling, and she had to run away. She's in a stable relationship now and the family hasn't been in regular contact. Her mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and the family is extremely religious and controlling. The author is scared of how they'll react, potential harassment, and the possible treatment of her child.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them. The options are A (yes) or B (no). From what I read, the author has valid reasons for not contacting her family. They weren't supportive, and their behavior was harmful. The family initiated contact only to scream at her, so she's not the one reaching out. The baby's well-being is also a concern.\n\nThe key factors here are the family's abusive behavior, the lack of communication from her side except for rare occasions, and the potential negative impact on both her and her child. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone who's been supportive; it's the estranged, abusive family. So, in this context, it's not her responsibility to inform them, especially if it's for her and her child's safety. The answer is probably B (no), she's not in the wrong.\n"
