We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for not telling their mom about being pregnant. The situation is complicated. The family isn't really in contact except for occasional hostile texts. The user ran away from home because of controlling and abusive family members, especially a narcissistic mom and a grandfather who runs the family like a cult. They've been living independently for a while, found a stable job, a partner, and now are pregnant.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the family was abusive and controlling. The user left because of this. The relationship with the family is minimal and hostile. The user hasn't told them about the pregnancy and is scared of their reaction. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them to do so. The user is feeling guilty but also afraid of the consequences if they tell.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong for not telling their mom. The user's reasoning is that since they don't communicate with the family, the pregnancy isn't \"hidden\" because they haven't been in contact. Also, they fear the family's response, which might be negative, especially about being unmarried and the potential treatment of the baby. They're worried the baby might be harmed by exposure to the family's behavior.\n\nFrom what I know about family dynamics and ethics, if the family is abusive and there's no healthy relationship, the responsibility to inform isn't necessarily there. The user isn't withholding the information from someone who has a positive relationship. The lack of communication isn't on the user\u2014they only receive hostile texts. The user is protecting themselves and their child from potential harm. In such cases, prioritizing one's well-being and the child's safety is reasonable. The guilt might come from societal expectations, but the reality of the situation is different. The user isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone they have a connection with; it's more about self-preservation. So, the answer would likely be B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
