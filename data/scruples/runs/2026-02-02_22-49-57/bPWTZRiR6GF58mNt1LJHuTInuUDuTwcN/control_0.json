We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the author left her family because they were controlling and abusive. She's been on her own for two years, found stability, and is now pregnant. The question is whether she's wrong for not informing her estranged family.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. The family hasn't been in touch except for occasional hostile texts. The author left due to abuse and is protecting both herself and her unborn child. The family's potential reaction could be harmful, given their controlling nature. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from active family members she's in contact with; she doesn't have any. \n\nThe boyfriend hasn't pressured her, so she's making her own decision. She's conflicted between guilt and fear. The main issue is whether she's obligated to inform family she's not in contact with. Legally, there's no requirement, but morally, some might argue she should. However, given the family's history, her decision to protect herself and her child seems justified. \n\nThe author isn't avoiding responsibility to family she's connected to; there's no contact. So, she's not in the wrong for prioritizing her well-being and her child's. The answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
