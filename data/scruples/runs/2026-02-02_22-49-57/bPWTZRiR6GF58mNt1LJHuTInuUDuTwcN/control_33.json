We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author left an abusive family two years ago because they were controlling and mentally abusive. Her mom is described as narcissistic, and her grandfather runs the family like a cult. They were extremely controlling, invading her privacy, monitoring her every move.\n\nNow she's pregnant with her boyfriend's child, and she hasn't told her family. She's scared of how they'll react\u2014probably angry, call her names, and maybe even affect the child. She wonders if it's hiding if they haven't talked in months. Also, she's worried about her baby not knowing her family and potential future issues.\n\nThe key points here are the family's history of abuse and control. If she told them, it's possible they'd react negatively, maybe even try to control the situation again. The author has a right to protect herself and her child from potential harm. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). From the description, the author isn't avoiding responsibility out of selfishness but because of genuine fear for her safety and her child's. The family isn't supportive; they were abusive. So, not telling them isn't a matter of hiding the truth in a bad way but protecting herself from a harmful situation. \n\nI think the answer is B. She's not in the wrong because the circumstances justify her decision. The family's behavior is the main issue here. There's no obligation to reconnect with family who have been abusive. Plus, she's prioritizing her child's well-being by keeping them away from a toxic environment. So, B makes sense.\n"
