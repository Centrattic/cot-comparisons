We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the author had a very traumatic experience with her family. They were controlling, abusive, and she ran away at 20. The family is described as narcissistic, religious, and controlling. She hasn't spoken to them much since leaving, only occasional texts that turn into arguments. Now she's pregnant and considering whether to tell them. She's scared of their reaction, possible blame, and the impact on her child. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them. On one hand, family might expect to know about a grandchild. But on the other hand, she's in a situation where contact is minimal and hostile. She's protecting herself and her child from potential harm. The last time they spoke, it was harassment. If she doesn't contact them, and they don't initiate, maybe she's not obligated to disclose. Also, if the family is abusive, withholding information could be a form of self-preservation. \n\nBut some might argue that family has a right to know, especially if the child is part of her life. However, given the family's history, it's reasonable for her to prioritize her well-being and her child's. The author mentions fear of how they'd treat the baby, which is a valid concern. The guilt she feels is about hiding it, but if the family hasn't made genuine efforts to reconnect, maybe it's not her responsibility. \n\nI think the key points are the abusive history, lack of communication, and her prioritizing safety. So the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
