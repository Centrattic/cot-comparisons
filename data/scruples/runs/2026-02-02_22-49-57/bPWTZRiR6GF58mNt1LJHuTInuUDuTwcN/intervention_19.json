I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. Let me start by reading through their situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told their biological family. They mention that the family isn't on speaking terms except for occasional texts where the parents end up screaming. The author doesn't contact them; the parents reach out. Two years ago, when they were 20, they ran away because the family was controlling and mentally abusive. The mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult, being extremely religious and controlling. The author left, found a job, home, and a partner, and now has a child. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them to tell the family, but the author feels conflicted. They're scared of the family's reaction, potential harassment, and the family's judgment about being unmarried. Also, they're worried about how the family might treat their baby. The author feels guilty for hiding it but questions if it's hiding if they haven't talked in months. They're considering not telling at all now and wonder if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the family's behavior. The family is described as abusive, controlling, and mentally harmful. The author left the family environment due to these reasons, which is a valid and important point. The fact that the family only contacts them to scream about their absence suggests that communication is toxic. The author is in a stable relationship and has a child, so their current life is separate from the family.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not informing their mom about the pregnancy. The key factors here are the history of abuse and the current state of the relationship. If the family is not part of the author's life and any contact is negative, the author might have a valid reason to avoid sharing personal news. The author is protecting themselves and their child from potential harm or judgment. \n\nHowever, some might argue that family has a right to know, especially about a grandchild. But given the circumstances, the author's safety and well-being, as well as the child's, are at stake. The family's potential reaction could be harmful, and the author is in a position to make decisions that protect their new family. \n\nThe author's guilt comes from the expectation that family should be informed, but in this case, the family isn't part of their life. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy in a deceptive way since they don't have contact. The fear of the family's reaction and the history of abuse support the author's decision to stay silent.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They are prioritizing their and their child's safety and well-being over a toxic family relationship. The answer should be B (No).\n"
