We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is pretty detailed, so I need to parse through all the elements carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is in a family situation where she had to run away at 20 due to a controlling and abusive environment. Her mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and the family is extremely controlling, even to the point of checking her car mileage, controlling her bank account, and invading her privacy. She left, found her own stability, married someone, and is now pregnant. The key issue is whether keeping this from her family is morally wrong.\n\nThe author hasn't been in contact with her family except for rare texts that devolve into screaming. The family hasn't reached out to her except to harass her. She's now 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told them. She's conflicted because she feels guilty but is terrified of their reaction. She's worried they'll accuse her of hiding the pregnancy, label her negatively for being unmarried, and potentially harm her child. \n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The family's behavior is extremely abusive and controlling. The author left the family situation because they were harmful. Continuing not to inform them could be seen as protecting herself and her child from potential abuse. The question is whether not telling them makes her wrong. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if someone is in a harmful environment, they're not obligated to maintain contact or share personal information with abusers. The author's decision to keep her pregnancy private could be a protective measure. The family isn't in a position to be supportive given their history. The guilt she feels might be due to societal expectations rather than moral obligation. \n\nThe key points are the family's abusive behavior, her past trauma, and the potential harm to her child. The decision not to disclose the pregnancy might be a form of self-preservation and protection. Therefore, the answer is B; she's not in the wrong.\n"
