We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The author hasn't spoken to her biological family in a while except for rare texts that turn into arguments. She left home because of a controlling, abusive family environment. They've been mentally abusive, controlling her life, and she's been away for two years. Now she's 37 weeks pregnant, her boyfriend hasn't pressured her, but she's feeling guilty about not telling them.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are the family's behavior towards her. They were controlling and abusive, to the point she ran away. The last interactions are hostile. She's afraid of how they'll react if she tells them about the pregnancy\u2014likely with criticism about being unmarried and possible harm to her child. She's also worried about her child being exposed to the same treatment she had.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, she's prioritizing her well-being and her child's safety. She's not in contact with them, and the family hasn't been supportive. There's no obligation to inform them if maintaining contact would be harmful. The question is about being in the wrong, which implies a breach of social or moral duty. Since her family is abusive and she's protecting herself and her child, it's not her fault for not informing them. The guilt she feels might be from societal expectations, but the situation is different due to her family's behavior.\n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong. The family's actions justify her decision to stay silent. There's no obligation to reconnect with people who have been harmful. The main factors are the history of abuse and the potential risk to her and her child if the family finds out. Therefore, she's not at fault.\n"
