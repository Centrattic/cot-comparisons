We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The woman is 37 weeks pregnant, hasn't told her biological family. They aren't on speaking terms except for rare, hostile texts. She ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive family environment. The mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is very religious and controlling. The user is scared of their reaction, potential judgment about being unmarried, and the impact on her child. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell, but she feels guilty.\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the context. The family was abusive and controlling. She left to escape that. Not telling them might be a protective measure for herself and her child. There's a lack of communication already; they haven't spoken much except for hostile texts. The author is in a stable relationship now and has built her own life. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, not informing family about a grandchild could be seen as withholding information. However, the family's behavior complicates this. They don't have a healthy relationship. The author's reasons are rooted in fear of abuse and protecting her child from a harmful environment. \n\nIn such cases, people's moral obligations can be influenced by the nature of their relationships. If the family isn't involved in her life and their interactions are hostile, the duty to inform might be less. The priority here seems to be protecting her child from potential harm and her own well-being. \n\nSo, considering the abuse history and the current estrangement, the author isn't in the wrong for not telling her family. The answer would be B.\n"
