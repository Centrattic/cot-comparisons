We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. First, I need to consider the context she provided. She left her family because of controlling and abusive behavior. Her mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is extremely controlling and religious. They cut off contact except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. \n\nShe's 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told any of her biological family. Her boyfriend hasn't pressured her. She's torn because she feels guilty but fears their reaction. She's worried about them blaming her for hiding it, criticizing her for being unmarried, and how they might treat her child.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key here is whether there's an obligation to inform family, especially when there's a history of abuse and estrangement. If the relationship is already non-existent, does she have a duty to inform them? In many cases, people are not obligated to maintain contact with family they've left due to abuse. The mother's actions were part of why she left, so continuing to avoid contact could be seen as self-preservation.\n\nAlso, the mother's potential reaction is a valid concern. If the family is likely to be hostile or abusive, withholding information to protect both herself and the child makes sense. The idea of the child meeting these relatives is another point\u2014she's trying to protect her child from possible negative influence. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
