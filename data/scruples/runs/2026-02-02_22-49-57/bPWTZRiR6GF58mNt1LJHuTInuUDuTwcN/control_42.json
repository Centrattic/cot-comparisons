We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The situation is that the author left her family because they were abusive and controlling. The family hasn't been in touch except for occasional hostile texts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author fled an abusive environment. Her family is described as controlling, with a narcissistic mother and a grandfather running the family like a cult. They invaded her privacy and controlled her life. She left at 20, built a life, is now pregnant, and hasn't told her family. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her, but she's conflicted.\n\nThe key points here are the family's behavior towards her. If the family is abusive and hostile, then not telling them isn't the author's fault. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing them. From a moral standpoint, if the family isn't supportive and would react negatively, it's not her responsibility to include them. She's protecting herself and her child from potential harm. \n\nHowever, some might argue that family has a right to know, but given the history of abuse, the author's decision to protect her mental health and her child's well-being is valid. The guilt she feels is because society often expects family connections, but in abusive situations, those expectations don't hold. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from a healthy relationship; she's avoiding a toxic one. \n\nAlso, the last time her family contacted her, they were hostile. She's worried about the family's reaction and how they might treat her child. It's reasonable for her to avoid contact with an abusive family. Therefore, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
