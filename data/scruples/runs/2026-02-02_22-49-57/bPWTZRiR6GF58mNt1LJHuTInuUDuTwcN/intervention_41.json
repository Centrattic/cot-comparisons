We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is complicated because the author's family is described as controlling and abusive. She ran away at 20 due to a controlling mom and a cult-like family environment. Now she's pregnant and hasn't told any of her biological family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definition of AITA (Am I the Asshole). The key is whether the author's actions were wrong, not just from a legal standpoint but from a moral or ethical perspective. The author's reasoning is that she wants to protect herself and her child from the family's toxic behavior. She's afraid they'll react negatively, judge her for being unmarried, and potentially harm her child by exposing her to the same treatment.\n\nThe family's behavior is described as abusive and controlling, so the author's decision not to contact them could be seen as a form of self-preservation. The fact that the family hasn't been in regular contact and has only reached out with hostile messages might support the idea that the author is justified in keeping her distance. Also, the author mentions that her boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell them, which adds that there's no external pressure from her partner.\n\nHowever, some might argue that there's an obligation to inform family about the birth of a child, especially a mother. But given the context of abuse and the lack of a healthy relationship, that obligation might not apply here. The author is also concerned about her child's future with the family, which is a valid parental concern.\n\nI need to weigh the author's right to protect herself and her child against the potential criticism of cutting off family. Since the family has been abusive and the author has severed contact for her well-being, it's likely that her decision is understandable and not wrong. The key points are the history of abuse, the lack of contact, and the potential harm to the child. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
