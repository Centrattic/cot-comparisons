I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for expecting the food deliverer not to knock. The situation is that the author, a new mom, had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to avoid disturbing her baby. The delivery people kept ignoring the signs, so she used a specific sign that worked for packages but then had an issue with a food delivery that was left outside, getting cold.\n\nFirst, the author's intention is understandable. As a new parent, she wants to minimize disturbances. She tried multiple ways to communicate her preference. The problem arises when the delivery person followed the sign's instruction to not knock, which led to the food being left outside and getting cold. \n\nThe key here is the difference between packages and food deliveries. Packages don't require immediate handling, but food does. The sign might have been effective for packages, but food deliveries need someone to be present to receive them. The author didn't consider that the sign might apply to both types of deliveries, leading to the problem. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests that maybe using the sign for food wasn't the best idea. The author might not have clearly specified which types of deliveries the sign applied to. However, she did use the sign in the context of delivery options for food as well. The delivery person followed instructions literally, but common sense might have required them to knock despite the sign for perishable items. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She did communicate her preferences, but perhaps didn't differentiate between package and food deliveries. However, the delivery person might have been expected to use judgment. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because she had a valid reason and communicated her needs, but maybe she could have been clearer. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. Considering the situation, the answer is B (No), because her intention was reasonable, and the delivery person's strict adherence caused the issue without considering the perishable nature of food.\n"
