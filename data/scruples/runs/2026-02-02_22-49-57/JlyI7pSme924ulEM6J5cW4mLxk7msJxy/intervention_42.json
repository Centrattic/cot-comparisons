I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who had a sign saying not to knock for packages. The delivery people kept knocking, so she got a new sign with corporate logos, which worked for packages\u2014no knocking. But when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door, and it got cold. The author is upset about the cold food and late delivery. Her husband says they were asking for it.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author wanted no knocking for packages and put up signs multiple times. The delivery drivers ignored the initial signs, so she used a different one with the courier logos. That worked for packages but now food was left outside, leading to a problem. She's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations of the delivery services. For packages, the sign worked; they didn't knock. But food delivery might be different. Some delivery services might have different protocols, or maybe the food delivery person saw the sign and assumed it applied to all deliveries, including food. The sign might not have been specific enough.\n\nThe author's intention was to stop knocking for packages, which she achieved. However, the sign might have been misinterpreted by the food delivery person. The problem here is that the sign probably didn't distinguish between package deliveries and food orders. So, the delivery person might have thought the same rule applied to food, hence leaving it at the door to avoid knocking, even if that meant the food would cool down.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she tried to communicate her preference clearly. The delivery person's misinterpretation might be on them. However, if the sign was too broad, maybe she should have specified that it's only for package deliveries and not for food. But she didn't have that opportunity here. The sign had corporate logos, which might have been a clear indication of the delivery company, but maybe the person assumed the same rule for all deliveries.\n\nThe husband's comment is that they were asking for it, implying that using the sign was the problem. But the author's intention was to stop the knocking, which was disruptive, especially as a new mom. She was following the delivery company's note sections to specify \"do not knock,\" but they ignored that. The sign was a more visible way to enforce that.\n\nThe food delivery person did follow the sign's instruction, but the outcome was negative. The question is whether the author's actions (using the sign) were reasonable. It seems she was within her rights to set expectations for deliveries. The sign worked for packages, but the unintended consequence for food might be a communication gap. The delivery person should have clarified if the sign applied to all deliveries, but in their job, they might just follow the sign's instruction without considering different types of deliveries.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She communicated her preference, and the delivery person followed the sign. The problem is the sign's ambiguity in specifying which deliveries it applied to. The author's reasonable request was to not be knocked on for packages, which she achieved. The food issue is a side effect, but not her fault. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
