I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who had been having packages knocked on the door even though she had clear signs saying \"Do not Knock.\" She tried different versions, including notes in delivery options, but they kept knocking. Then she got a sign with pictures of the courier logos, which worked for packages but caused a problem when a food delivery person left a cold meal at the door without knocking. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should prevail.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is the asshole here. The options are A for yes (she's wrong) and B for no (she's not). I need to determine if her sign was a reasonable request and if the delivery person's action was appropriate. \n\nFirst, the sign was effective for packages, which needed to be left unobtrusively, probably because she's a new mom and wants to avoid disturbing her baby. The sign with the courier logos likely made the delivery people understand that they should leave packages without knocking. But when it came to food delivery, which is time-sensitive, the same sign might not be as applicable. Food delivery usually requires a quick handoff and confirmation that the customer is present, so not knocking could lead to delays and issues like the meal getting cold. \n\nThe author's intention was to prevent noise, which is understandable, especially with a baby. However, food delivery isn't the same as regular packages. The delivery person might have followed the same procedure for all deliveries, thinking the sign applied to all types. But the author expected that for food, they would knock to ensure it's received hot, which is a different scenario. \n\nThe problem here is that the sign's instructions were for packages, not food. If the sign was specific to package deliveries, then the food delivery person wasn't at fault for not knocking when they thought the same rule applied. However, the author might not have considered that food delivery requires interaction. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did make an effort to communicate her needs, and perhaps the delivery person should have used their judgment. But the sign was about not knocking, not about handling food differently. The food delivery might have needed a knock because they need to check if someone is there to take it immediately. \n\nSo, the author's sign was clear and effective for its intended purpose\u2014packages. But when applied to food, it didn't work out. Her husband's argument is that the sign led to the problem, but she intended it to prevent disturbances. The answer depends on whether the sign was too broad or if the delivery person should have exercised common sense. The author's reasoning is that common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should have knocked for food despite the sign. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because her sign was specific to packages and regular deliveries. The food delivery situation is different and the delivery person should have realized that the meal needs to be handed over promptly and hot. The sign's effectiveness for packages doesn't necessarily apply to food. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
