I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who had multiple signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to prevent packages from being left at the door. Despite her efforts, delivery people kept knocking, which she didn't want. Then she put up a more prominent sign with the courier logos, which worked in that the delivery person didn't knock, but instead left the food at the door. The food was cold when they found it later, and her husband blamed them, but she thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wanted packages left at the door without knocking, so she took steps to make that clear. She used signs and notes in delivery options. When the food delivery person followed the sign and didn't knock, the food was left there, leading to it being cold. The question is whether she's wrong for expecting the delivery person to follow the sign, but also if the delivery person didn't use common sense to maybe check if someone was home before leaving the food.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the delivery person should have realized that not knocking might be a problem in certain situations, like food delivery, where timing is important. The husband thinks they asked for it, implying that the sign was too direct and maybe caused the issue. \n\nBut the author's intent was to have packages left without knocking, which she successfully achieved. The problem arose because the food required more immediate attention. The delivery person followed instructions literally but didn't consider the context. So, the author might not be in the wrong because she was trying to prevent constant knocking, which she didn't want. However, maybe the sign was too ambiguous for food deliveries. But she specified \"Do not knock\" in multiple ways, including the sign with logos. The delivery person might not have known it was food and just followed the sign. \n\nThe key points are: the author made her instructions clear, the delivery person followed them, but failed to use judgment in a situation where knocking might have been necessary (since food gets cold). The author might not be at fault because she communicated her request, and the delivery person didn't adapt to the context. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
