I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" for packages, which worked initially, but then when a food delivery person didn't knock, the food got left outside and was ice cold. Her husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author wanted to prevent delivery people from knocking because she's a new mom, maybe with a baby who gets disturbed by knocks. She put up signs, which the package deliverers ignored. Then she switched to a sign with corporate logos, which worked for packages but failed with the food delivery person. The food delivery person left it outside, leading to a cold meal.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks she's not in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nSo, from a fairness perspective, she's trying to set clear instructions to avoid disturbances. But when someone doesn't knock for food, it's reasonable to expect that the customer might want it handed over. However, the sign was clear about \"do not knock,\" so maybe the delivery person followed the instruction literally instead of using judgment.\n\nBut food is different from packages. Packages can be left at the door, but food is time-sensitive and needs to be warm. The delivery person might have followed the sign's instruction to not knock, hence leaving it at the door, but that led to a problem. So the author's instruction was followed, but it had an unintended consequence.\n\nIs she at fault? Well, she tried to communicate her needs clearly but didn't consider that food delivery might require a different handling. Maybe she should have made an exception for food, but the sign was general. However, as a new mom, her priority is her baby's sleep, so the instruction makes sense. The delivery person might have been following the sign without considering the context. So the problem is more on the delivery person for not using common sense, as the author said.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her wishes, and it's the deliverer's responsibility to assess the situation. The answer would be B (No).\n"
