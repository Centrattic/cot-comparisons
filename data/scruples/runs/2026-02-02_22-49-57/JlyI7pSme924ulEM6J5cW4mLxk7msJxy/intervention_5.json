I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're the asshole for expecting the delivery person to knock. They\u2019re a new mom with lots of packages. They had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" but people kept knocking. So they put up a sign with courier logos that said not to knock, which worked for packages. But then when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door, and it got cold. Now they're wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The main issue is whether the same sign that worked for packages should apply to food delivery. The user had specific instructions for packages, but maybe food is different. Food deliveries usually need to be handled differently because they're time-sensitive and might need to be kept warm. The delivery person probably followed the sign's instruction to leave it at the door, which is fine for packages but not ideal for food. \n\nThe user mentioned they wrote \"Do not knock\" in every note, but maybe they didn't specify that food should be handled differently. The sign might have been misinterpreted as a universal instruction for all deliveries. The husband says they were asking for it, which makes sense because the sign didn't differentiate between package and food deliveries. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, they tried to communicate their preference, but maybe they should have made an exception for food. However, the sign was specific to the courier's logo, so maybe the delivery person didn't realize it was a different type of delivery. The user might not be entirely at fault because the communication could have been clearer. On the other hand, expecting food to be left outside when it's supposed to be hot is a valid concern. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong. They communicated their wishes, but the situation is a bit of a mix-up. The delivery person followed the instructions, but the instructions might not have covered all scenarios. So the answer is B.\n"
