I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" for package deliveries. She had tried different methods to communicate this, but the delivery people kept knocking. Finally, she used a sign with company logos that said not to knock, and it worked for packages. However, when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it outside without knocking, and it got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions and actions of both parties. The author's main goal was to prevent delivery people from knocking, possibly to avoid disturbing a baby or because she was busy. She took several steps to communicate this, including handwritten signs and notes in delivery options. The sign with company logos was effective for packages, but not for food delivery. \n\nNow, the key points here are the different types of deliveries. Packages versus food. When ordering dinner, the delivery person might expect a different handling. Food is perishable and requires prompt delivery, so knocking to ensure it's received properly makes sense. The sign might have been misinterpreted. The author's sign was specific to packages, but maybe the food delivery person didn't realize it didn't apply to food orders. \n\nThe author's husband said they were asking for it, implying they should have known the sign's message might apply to all deliveries. However, the author argues that common sense should have prevailed. So, common sense here would be that food delivery needs to be handled differently. The delivery person should have knocked to avoid the food getting cold, even if the sign said not to knock for packages. \n\nBut was the sign too vague? If the sign didn't specify that it was only for packages, then the delivery person might have followed it regardless of the item. The author might be at fault for not being clear enough about the scope of the sign. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment to knock for food, even if the sign said not to for packages. \n\nThe outcome is that the food was left outside and got cold. The author's main issue is that she didn't want to be disturbed, but food delivery requires interaction. The husband's point is valid because they might have set a precedent that could lead to issues with all deliveries. However, the author's intention was to prevent knocking for packages, not food, so maybe the delivery person overstepped by not knocking in this case. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's sign might have been too broad, leading to unintended consequences. She might be partially at fault for not specifying the sign's application. However, the delivery person also should have used common sense to handle food differently. The answer isn't entirely clear, but leaning towards the author being at least partially in the wrong because the sign wasn't specific enough. But since the question is whether she is in the wrong, and the sign's effectiveness for food wasn't considered, the answer could be A (yes). However, some might argue that the delivery person should have knocked regardless. I need to check the AITA community's typical responses. Usually, if you set up a sign that has unintended consequences due to not being clear, you might be held responsible. So the answer is A.\n"
