I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new mom who had issues with delivery people knocking on her door despite her clear instructions. She put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" and used notes in the delivery options, but they were ignored. Then she found a sign with the courier logos that worked to prevent knocking, but it caused a problem when a food delivery person didn't knock, leading to a cold meal.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks she isn't, but wants my opinion. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the author had clear instructions not to knock. She tried multiple times to communicate this, but it wasn't respected. Then, she created a more effective sign with the logos, which worked for packages. However, when the food delivery came, the driver didn't knock, left the meal at the door, and it got cold. The author is upset because the food was supposed to be delivered hot, but it wasn't.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the key points are the communication of instructions and the outcome. The author's main intent was to prevent knocks, which she successfully did. However, the sign might have been too broad, applying to all deliveries, including food. The food delivery person followed the sign's instruction by not knocking, but that led to a problem because food delivery typically requires knocking to ensure someone is there to receive it, especially for hot meals.\n\nIs the author responsible? She wanted no knocking for packages, which is reasonable. But maybe she should have differentiated between package deliveries and food deliveries. The sign didn't specify, so the delivery person followed it as written. The husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests that the sign's effect was unintended. \n\nThe author's intent was good\u2014to avoid knocks for packages. The unintended consequence was a cold meal. The question is whether she should have anticipated that the sign might affect food deliveries differently. Since the sign had the courier logos, maybe it was clear it applied to all deliveries, including food. However, food delivery usually requires knocking to ensure the recipient is present. So, maybe the author didn't consider that different types of deliveries have different protocols. \n\nAlternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense. Even though the sign said not to knock, maybe they should have knocked anyway for a food delivery to ensure the meal is received hot. But the sign was explicit, so the delivery person might have felt bound by it. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author's intention was to prevent knocks for packages, which worked, but the sign's application was too broad. She might not be in the wrong because her instructions were clear and she had a valid reason. However, the outcome was a problem because of the sign's wording. The delivery person followed the instructions, leading to the cold meal. So, maybe the fault isn't on the author but on the delivery person not using judgment. But the question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because she had a valid reason and the delivery person should have used common sense. However, she might not have considered that the sign would affect food deliveries differently. But since she explicitly said not to knock in all cases, she's not in the wrong.\n"
