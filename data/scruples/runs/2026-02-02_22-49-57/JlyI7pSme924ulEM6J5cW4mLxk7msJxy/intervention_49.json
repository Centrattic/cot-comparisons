I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who has a sign saying \"Do not knock\" for deliveries because she doesn't want people knocking on her door. She tried various ways to communicate this, but the delivery people kept ignoring her. Then she put up a sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages, but when she ordered food, the delivery person left it outside, and it was ice cold. Now she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author tried multiple times to communicate that she didn't want knocking. She used written signs and notes in the checkout. The only time it worked was when she used the sign with the courier logos. But when she ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door, leading to a cold meal. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should prevail.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks she's not in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author's intention was to prevent people from knocking, which she managed with the sign. However, food delivery is different from packages. Packages can be left safely at a door, but food needs to be delivered hot. By having the sign that says \"Do not knock,\" maybe the courier assumed they could leave it outside, not realizing the temperature issue. The problem here is that the sign worked for packages but not for food, which requires a warmer delivery method.\n\nIs the author responsible for not specifying that the sign applies only to packages and not food? Maybe she didn't think about the difference between package deliveries and food deliveries. The sign might have been misinterpreted by the courier. The courier's job is to ensure the food is delivered hot, so perhaps they should have knocked to get the author's attention instead of just leaving it outside. But the author's sign said not to knock, so maybe they had no choice but to leave it there. However, the food being cold is an issue. The author might have expected the courier to use judgment and knock despite the sign if the item was perishable or needed immediate attention. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did communicate clearly through various means not to knock. The problem is that the courier followed the sign but didn't consider the nature of the item being delivered. The author might argue that her instructions were followed correctly, but the outcome was negative because of an oversight in the instructions. The husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests that using a sign that might lead to food being left outside was their fault. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author should have made an exception for food deliveries. If the sign didn't specify that it was only for packages, then the courier followed the instructions, but the author might have been careless in not considering different delivery types. However, if the sign was meant for all deliveries, then the courier did follow the instructions, but the result was unintended. In that case, the courier might be at fault for not using common sense regarding the food's temperature. \n\nBut the author might be in the wrong because she didn't clarify that the sign only applied to packages, not food. Since food delivery is a different scenario, maybe the author should have made that distinction clear. However, if the sign was general and applied to all deliveries, then the courier's action was in line with the instructions, and the author's expectations were too high regarding the delivery method for food. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a grey area. The author tried to communicate her preference, but didn't account for different types of deliveries. The courier followed the instructions but failed to consider the perishable nature of the food. Depending on whose responsibility it is to adapt the instructions based on the delivery type. If the courier is expected to use judgment, then the author isn't in the wrong. If the courier strictly follows signs without discretion, then the author's sign caused the problem. I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the courier should have used common sense to deliver the food properly despite the sign.\n"
