I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new mom who has signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for deliveries. She used various methods to communicate this, but the delivery people kept knocking. Then she put up a sign with the courier logos that worked for packages, but when they ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock, left it at the door, and the food was cold. The author is upset, and her husband says they asked for it. She thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points are her signs and the delivery person's actions. The signs were clear for packages, but food delivery might be different. The sign might have been too generalized, leading the delivery person to not knock even when it wasn't a package. The author expected the delivery person to use common sense, but maybe the sign wasn't specific enough. She might have assumed the delivery person would distinguish between packages and food, but the instruction was to not knock at all. So, the sign's wording could have been ambiguous. The delivery person followed the sign literally, leading to the cold food. The author's expectation was that the delivery person would knock for food but not for packages, but the sign didn't specify. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not making the instructions clear enough for different types of deliveries. The answer might be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because the sign was too vague and led to the problem. But maybe B if the delivery person should have known the difference. Hmm. The sign said \"Do not knock\" with the logos, which the food delivery person might have followed strictly. She didn't mention exceptions for food. So, perhaps she's at fault for not considering that different types of deliveries might need different handling. Therefore, A.\n"
