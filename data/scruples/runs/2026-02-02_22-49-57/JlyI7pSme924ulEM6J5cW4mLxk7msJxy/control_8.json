I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who has been getting packages delivered, and she's had issues with the delivery people knocking on her door even though she put up signs and notes saying \"Do not knock.\" Then she switched to a sign with the corporate logos, which worked for packages but when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door and it got cold. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author tried multiple times to communicate that she doesn't want to be knocked on the door. She used handwritten signs, notes in the checkout, but they were ignored. Then she found a different sign with company logos, which was effective for packages. However, when it came to food delivery, the same approach caused an issue because the food was left outside and got cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nSo, the key here is whether the sign was too broad. The sign with the corporate logos might have been intended for packages, but food delivery might require a different handling. Maybe the sign didn't specify that food should be brought in. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction by not knocking and leaving it at the door, which is correct for packages but not for food. \n\nThe author's intent was to prevent being disturbed, but in doing so, she might not have considered that food needs temperature control. She communicated clearly for packages, but perhaps the sign's message was too absolute. The delivery person did what was instructed, but the outcome was negative because the food was left outside. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she tried to communicate her needs, but maybe she should have made an exception for food. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used discretion. But the sign didn't specify exceptions. The author might not be in the wrong because she was trying to protect her privacy, but the result was unintended. However, she could be seen as overgeneralizing the instructions, leading to a problem. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nBut considering that she had multiple signs and the delivery person followed them literally, maybe the author should have made a note for food. But she might not have expected food delivery to be affected. The husband's comment that they were asking for it implies he thinks the sign was too broad. The author's frustration is about the delivery person not using common sense, but common sense might not always apply in such scenarios. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the author was trying to communicate her needs, and the delivery person followed the instructions, but the sign's message was too absolute. However, she could have anticipated that food delivery might need different handling and adjusted the sign accordingly. But since she didn't, is she in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment, but the sign said not to knock. It's a tough call. I think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong because she communicated her preferences, but she could have been more specific. Since it's a yes/no, and the question is whether she's the asshole, the answer is B.\n"
