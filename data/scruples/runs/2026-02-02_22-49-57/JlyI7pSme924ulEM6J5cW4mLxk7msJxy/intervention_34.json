I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on the door. The situation is that the author, a new mom, had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, which were ignored. So she created a sign with courier logos that worked, but then when a food delivery was left at the door, it got cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should prevail.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is whether the author's sign was reasonable. The author had previously had problems with people knocking despite clear instructions. The signs were ignored, so she used the logos of the couriers to make it clear. But food delivery is different from packages. Packages might be left at the door, but food is time-sensitive. The sign probably told couriers not to knock, so they just left it. But the food deliverer, seeing the sign, didn't knock and left it, leading to a problem.\n\nSo the question is, was the author wrong to have the sign? On one hand, she wanted to stop people from knocking, which she had a right to do. On the other, food delivery requires immediate attention. The sign didn't differentiate between packages and food. Maybe the author should have specified different instructions for different types of deliveries. But the sign was made to address the previous issue, and the food delivery wasn't part of the original problem. The deliverer followed the sign's instructions, but it caused an issue. So the author might not be in the wrong because she was trying to get her previous issue resolved. But maybe she could have adjusted the sign to handle food deliveries. However, she didn't, and the deliverer did what was asked. The husband's comment is justifiably pointing out that using the sign for all deliveries, including food, could lead to problems. The author's reasoning is that common sense should have prevailed, but maybe the deliverer was just following the sign strictly. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance. The author's signs were about packages, but the food delivery is a different service. She might not have considered that, but it's unclear if the sign was specific enough. Still, the main issue was the sign's application beyond the original problem. Since the sign worked for packages but failed for food, the author might not be entirely at fault.\n"
