I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has been using signs and notes to tell delivery people not to knock because she doesn't want them to wake her baby. She found a sign with courier logos that worked for packages, but when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left the food at the door without knocking, and it got cold. The husband thinks they \"asked for it,\" but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had clear instructions not to knock, which were followed for packages but not for food. The delivery person followed the sign's instructions literally, leading to a problem because food delivery typically requires timely handling. The user is asking if the author is at fault.\n\nThe key points are: the sign was effective for packages but caused an issue with food delivery. The author's intention was to prevent disturbance to the baby, but the method led to an unintended consequence. The delivery person followed the written instruction but didn't use judgment for a situation that might require it (like food that needs to be warm). \n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, the author set the rules, which the delivery person followed. However, the expectation might be that delivery people use common sense, especially for perishable items. But if the delivery person strictly followed the written instructions, they might not be at fault. The author's sign might have been too broad, not differentiating between packages and food. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not considering that different types of deliveries require different handling. However, the delivery person also might have used judgment. \n\nBut in the scenario, the sign was effective, so the author's method worked for her primary goal (no knocking). The food delivery issue is a trade-off. The husband's comment that they \"asked for it\" suggests that the author's rules led to the problem. But the author argues that common sense should have been used. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the general consensus often considers if the person's actions were reasonable. The author's signs were specific, and the delivery person followed them. However, the unintended consequence might mean the author didn't account for different delivery scenarios. But the delivery person's strict adherence to instructions could also be seen as following protocol. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the sign was clear and she had a valid reason (protecting the baby's sleep). However, there's a case that she should have anticipated that food delivery might need a different approach. But given the information, the delivery person followed the instructions, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
