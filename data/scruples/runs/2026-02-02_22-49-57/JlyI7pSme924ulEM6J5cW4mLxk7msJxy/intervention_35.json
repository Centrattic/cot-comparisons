I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a new mom with many packages, so they used signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for deliveries. But the delivery people kept knocking, so they switched to a sign with logos of couriers, which worked for packages but now caused a problem with a food delivery that was left at the door and got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author tried multiple times to communicate \"Do not knock\" through notes and signs, but the delivery people ignored it. Then they used a more visible sign with company logos, which stopped the knocking for packages but led to a food delivery issue. The question is whether she's in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock, even though she had the sign up.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that common sense should prevail. She wanted to avoid the hassle of opening the door, maybe because of being a new mom and needing to manage things without disturbing the baby or herself. The sign was effective for packages, but food delivery is different because it's time-sensitive and needs to be hot. The delivery person left it at the door without knocking, leading to a cold meal.\n\nNow, considering the options: A (yes, she's in the wrong) or B (no). The user thinks she's not in the wrong. \n\nFrom one angle, she did set clear instructions with the sign, so if the delivery person followed the sign, they might not have knocked. But food delivery typically requires more immediate attention. Maybe the sign was too general and didn't differentiate between packages and food. The delivery person might have followed the sign's instructions, but the result was a problem. The author might not have considered that food needs to be delivered in a timely manner and perhaps should have made a separate sign for food. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to avoid being disturbed, which is understandable as a new mom. The sign worked for packages but not for food. The delivery person might not have realized the difference. The husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests he feels they shouldn't expect different treatment for food. \n\nBut the author might not be in the wrong because she was following through on her previous instructions, and the delivery person's action (leaving food unattended) is against standard practices. However, the sign might have been ambiguous. The key is whether the sign's instructions were too broad, leading to this issue. \n\nAlternatively, the delivery person should have used better judgment. Even with the sign, common sense would suggest that leaving hot food at the door could lead to it getting cold. So maybe the delivery person is at fault for not knocking, even with the sign. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers both parties' intentions and the reasonableness of their actions. The author's signs were meant to prevent disturbances, but food delivery requires a different approach. The sign might have been too strict, not accounting for different types of deliveries. Therefore, the author might be partially at fault for not having separate instructions. However, the delivery person might also be at fault for not using judgment to knock for a time-sensitive delivery. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the sign was intended to apply to all deliveries, then she might be responsible for not anticipating the food issue. But if the sign was only meant for packages, maybe she's not. The sign had logos of couriers, which might imply it's for all deliveries, including food. So perhaps she is in the wrong for not differentiating. \n\nAlternatively, the sign's effectiveness for packages shows that the message was clear, but it's a one-size-fits-all approach. So maybe she's not in the wrong for having the sign, but the situation is a misunderstanding. The delivery person's job might require knocking for food, but the sign prevented that. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions were reasonable, but the sign's application caused an unintended problem. Since the sign was effective in preventing knocks for packages, but food is different, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong. However, she could have adjusted the sign to specify exceptions for food. But since the sign didn't, the delivery person might have followed instructions, leading to the cold food. However, the delivery person should know that food needs to be handled differently. \n\nGiven that, the author might not be in the wrong because the delivery person should have used common sense despite the sign. Or she is in the wrong for not specifying. It's a bit of a toss-up. The key is whether the sign's instructions were too broad. Since she didn't specify that food deliveries should knock, the sign's instructions were followed, but that caused an issue. Therefore, the author is partially at fault, but maybe not entirely. However, in AITA terms, if the community leans towards the author's intentions being reasonable, then B (no). But if the sign's broad instructions are the problem, then A. \n\nI think the correct answer is B (no), the author is not in the wrong. The sign's intention was to prevent unnecessary disturbances, which is understandable. The delivery person's failure to use judgment in this specific case is on them. The author's signs were meant for packages, but even if applied to food, the delivery person should have knocked to ensure the food's quality. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
