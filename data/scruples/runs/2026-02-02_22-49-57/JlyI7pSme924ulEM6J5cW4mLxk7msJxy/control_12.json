I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're a new mom with a lot of packages. They've been putting up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to avoid people knocking on the door, which they probably want to keep quiet for the baby. They even wrote that note in the delivery instructions every time, but no one listened. Then they found a new sign with the courier logos, which worked for the packages\u2014no more knocking. But then when they ordered food, the delivery person left the food at the door without knocking, and it got cold. The husband says they're asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should've made the delivery person understand not to leave food there.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The author set up signs to prevent knocking, which worked for packages. However, food delivery is different from packages. Packages can just sit outside, but food needs to be delivered hot, so the delivery person should probably knock to ensure it's received properly. The problem here is that the sign might have been too general\u2014maybe it didn't account for food vs. packages. The author might have assumed that all deliveries should leave things at the door, but food delivery is an exception. \n\nSo, the author's intention was good\u2014to avoid noise for the baby. But maybe they didn't consider that food delivery requires a different handling. The delivery person followed the sign's instructions literally, but that led to a bad outcome. The author might be in the wrong because the sign could be misinterpreted for food orders. However, the delivery person could have used common sense and knocked, even if the sign said not to. But the author might argue that the sign was clear. But food is different, so maybe the sign should have exceptions. \n\nAlternatively, the author could have made a distinction between packages and food in their signs. Since they didn't, maybe they're at fault. The husband's point is that they're asking for it by having the sign. But the author thinks the delivery person should use common sense. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the key point is whether the author's sign was reasonable. If the sign didn't differentiate between types of deliveries, then maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't account for the different needs of food delivery. So, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because the sign was too broad and didn't consider that food delivery requires a different approach. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the delivery person should have knocked regardless. But since the sign existed, they might have been following it. Hmm. I think the answer is A.\n"
