I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're a new mom with lots of packages, and they wanted delivery people not to knock. They put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" but people kept ignoring them. So they changed to a sign with company logos, which worked, but now the food delivery person left the dinner at the door, which was ice cold when they noticed.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break it down. The author clearly communicated their preference not to be knocked on via various methods\u2014handwritten signs and delivery notes. The new sign with the logos was effective for packages but caused an issue with the food delivery. The food was left outside and got cold. The husband thinks they \"asked for it,\" implying they're responsible for the sign leading to the problem.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to avoid interruptions, which is understandable, especially for a new mom. They tried multiple ways to communicate their wishes. The sign worked for packages, but the food delivery situation had different requirements. Food delivery usually needs a warm handoff, so maybe the sign didn't account for that nuance. The delivery person might not have realized that the \"no knock\" rule applies differently to food versus packages.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author's sign was broad, not specifying different types of deliveries. They expected the delivery person to use common sense, like bringing the food inside if knocking is prohibited. However, the delivery person might not have known that, especially if the sign was generic. The author might share some responsibility for not making the exception clear.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions directly caused the issue. They wanted to prevent knocks, which the sign did, but in doing so, they might have inadvertently prevented the delivery person from communicating the need for a warm handoff. The husband's point is that they created a situation where the delivery person couldn't properly deliver the food. The author argues that common sense should have been used, but maybe that's expecting more than what was communicated.\n\nIn the end, the author tried to solve a problem they had with packages, but the solution had unintended consequences for a different type of delivery. They might not be entirely wrong for trying to address their own needs, but perhaps the sign wasn't specific enough. However, given the circumstances, it's a tricky situation. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because their primary intent was valid, and the delivery person should have adapted. Alternatively, the author might share some blame for not considering the food delivery scenario. \n\nGiven that, the answer could be B (No), because the author's main issue was with interruptions from packages and they tried to mitigate that, but the food delivery situation was a different case where the delivery person needed to act differently. The author's sign was clear but perhaps not detailed enough for all scenarios. The delivery person should have recognized that food requires a different approach, so the fault isn't entirely on the author.\n"
