I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a new mom who's had a lot of package deliveries. She kept getting knocked on the door even though she had signs and notes saying \"Do not Knock.\" Frustrated, she put up a sign with courier logos that worked for packages but then backfired when a food delivery person left the food at the door in the cold, making it late and cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to prevent people from knocking, which she did for packages. But food delivery might be different because you usually want someone to interact, like checking the food or confirming delivery. The sign might have been misinterpreted or applied too broadly. The delivery person followed the sign literally, leading to the food being left outside, which was clearly not what the author wanted.\n\nThe author expects the delivery person to use common sense, but maybe the sign didn't account for different types of deliveries. The sign's effectiveness for packages worked because maybe packages don't require temperature control, but food does. So the author might have created a sign that's too strict for food deliveries. The husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests that the sign's instructions might have been too rigid without considering exceptions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is valid because she's a new mom dealing with a lot, and having people knock repeatedly could be stressful. She tried multiple times to communicate her preference. The food delivery person followed the instructions but didn't adapt, which is on them too. However, the author might not have considered that different delivery types need different handling. So, maybe she's partly at fault for not differentiating between package and food delivery instructions.\n\nI think the key here is whether the sign was too broad. The author wanted no knocking for packages, but food delivery requires interaction. If the sign didn't specify, the delivery person might not know to knock for food. So, the author might be in the wrong for not making that distinction. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense despite the sign. But the sign said \"Do not knock,\" so maybe they followed it too literally. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the author's sign was the cause of the problem, even if well-intentioned, she might share some responsibility. So the answer could be A (Yes, in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn. Maybe the delivery person is also at fault, but the question is about the author.\n"
