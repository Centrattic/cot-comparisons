I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who has been getting packages delivered. She had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" because she didn't want the delivery people to knock, maybe because she's a new mom and doesn't want to be disturbed. She tried various methods\u2014handwritten signs, notes in the checkout, even a new sign with logos that worked for packages. But then when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left the food at the door without knocking, it was ice cold, and she's upset.\n\nSo the question is whether she's at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, her intention was to prevent knocking for packages. She made clear instructions, but they weren't respected. Then she used a more effective sign with logos, which worked for packages. However, when a food delivery came, the same instruction applied, but in this case, it led to a problem because the food was left outside and got cold. The issue is whether expecting not to be knocked on for food delivery is unreasonable.\n\nFood delivery is different from packages. Packages can be left at the door, but food is time-sensitive and needs to be given directly to the customer or someone at the door. If the delivery person didn't knock, they might leave it outside where it could get cold. The author's instruction was for packages, but food is a different service. The problem is that she might have generalized the instruction to all deliveries, not just packages. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, thinking it applied to all deliveries, which led to the cold food.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she wanted to prevent knocking for packages, which is reasonable. But maybe she didn't specify that the instruction was only for packages and not for food deliveries. The sign had corporate logos, which might imply it's for all delivery services. So she might have been too broad in her instructions. The delivery person followed the sign as per her request, which worked for packages but not for food. She's upset because the food was left outside, but she also wanted no knocking. The husband says they asked for it, which is a point in favor of her being partly at fault.\n\nOn the other hand, common sense might suggest that food delivery needs a different handling. But if the sign didn't specify, the delivery person might not know. The author might not have considered that different types of deliveries require different handling. So maybe she's not entirely at fault, but she could have been more specific. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether her general instruction was reasonable. Since she wanted no knocking for packages and it worked, but food is different, maybe she's not at fault. But the fact that the sign applied to all deliveries might mean she's partly responsible for not clarifying. Hmm.\n\nI think the key is that she didn't specify that the \"do not knock\" instruction was only for packages, not food. So the delivery person followed it as written, leading to the problem. Therefore, she's not entirely in the wrong, but maybe she could have been clearer. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she acted to prevent being disturbed (as a new mom), but the consequence was a cold meal, it's a bit of a toss-up. The answer might be B (no) because her intention was valid, but maybe there's a nuance where she should have specified. Alternatively, maybe she's at fault for not making the instructions clear for different delivery types. I'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong, because her main issue was with packages and she had valid reasons. The food situation was an oversight, but not her fault entirely.\n"
