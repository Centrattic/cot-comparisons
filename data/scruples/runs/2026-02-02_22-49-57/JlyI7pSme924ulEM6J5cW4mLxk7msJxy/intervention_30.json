I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a new mom with a lot of packages. She's been trying to tell delivery people not to knock because maybe her baby is sleeping or she's busy. She put up signs and wrote \"Do not knock\" in delivery notes repeatedly, but they kept knocking. Then she found a sign with the courier logos that worked\u2014delivery people stopped knocking. But then, when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it got cold. She's upset about that, and her husband says they asked for it. She thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, she clearly communicated her preference not to be knocked on, and the sign worked for packages. But food delivery might be different. People usually expect their food to be handed to them, not left outside. Maybe the delivery person didn't knock because the sign said not to, but food is perishable and needs to be given promptly. However, the author had no way of knowing the delivery person would interpret the sign the same way for food. She tried to communicate her preferences, and the sign worked, but this time it backfired. The husband's comment that they \"asked for it\" is a bit harsh, but maybe he's right in that the sign applied to all deliveries. However, the author's intention was for packages, not food. She might not have considered that food delivery requires a different approach. But she didn't specify that the sign was only for packages. So maybe there's some ambiguity. The delivery person followed the instructions literally, which led to a problem. The author might be in the wrong if she didn't clarify the sign's scope. But she's a new mom with a lot on her plate, and the sign was generic with courier logos. It's possible the delivery person didn't realize food was an exception. So, is it her fault? Maybe not entirely. She tried to communicate her needs, and the system failed. The delivery person should use common sense, but maybe she should have made the sign clearer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the sign didn't specify \"except for food,\" she might be responsible for the misunderstanding. However, the core issue is that she wanted no knocks, and the delivery person followed that, leading to a cold meal. The author's frustration is valid, but so is the delivery person's following instructions. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she tried to set clear instructions, and the problem arose from the delivery person not applying common sense. The author's request was reasonable, but she didn't account for food delivery, which is a different scenario. However, she's not the one who left it at the door; the delivery person is. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. But the husband's point is that they asked for it by putting up the sign. But the sign wasn't specific. So, maybe she's partially at fault, but the main blame is on the delivery person for not using judgment. The answer might be B.\n"
