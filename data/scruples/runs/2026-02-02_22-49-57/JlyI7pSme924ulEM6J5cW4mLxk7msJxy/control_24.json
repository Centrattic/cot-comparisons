I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're a new mom who gets a lot of packages. They\u2019ve been putting up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" and also adding notes in delivery options, but the delivery people kept knocking. Then they found a sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages but when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, leading to it being cold when they realized.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to stop delivery people from knocking, which they did for packages. The sign worked, but when it came to a food delivery, the same approach caused an issue. The key question is whether they were right to expect the delivery person to use common sense here. The sign was meant to prevent knocking for packages, but food might require a different approach. Maybe the sign didn't specify that food deliveries need knocking. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction literally, which worked for packages but not for food. \n\nThe author might argue that packages and food are different; food needs to be handed over quickly to stay warm. However, the sign didn't make that distinction. The delivery person followed the instructions given, which were to not knock. The author's mistake could be not making it clear that the \"Do not Knock\" rule applies only to packages and not food. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment to knock for food, even if the sign said not to. But if the sign was so effective that it was followed to the letter, then maybe the author is at fault for not anticipating that the sign would apply to all deliveries, including food. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person might be expected to use common sense, recognizing that food needs to be handed over immediately. But the sign didn't say anything about exceptions. The author's husband said they were asking for it, which suggests that by creating such a strict rule, they might have caused the problem themselves. The author argues that common sense should have been applied, but the delivery person didn't do that. So is the author wrong for not making the sign more specific, or is the delivery person wrong for following the sign too literally?\n\nI think the main point is that the author's instructions were too broad. They wanted packages left at the door without knocking, which is reasonable, but food delivery typically requires a different handling. The sign didn't differentiate between package delivery and food delivery, leading to an unintended consequence. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not considering that different types of deliveries require different handling. However, the delivery person could also be expected to know that food needs to be handed over immediately. But since the sign explicitly said not to knock, and the delivery person followed it, the responsibility might lie with the author for not making their instructions clear enough. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
