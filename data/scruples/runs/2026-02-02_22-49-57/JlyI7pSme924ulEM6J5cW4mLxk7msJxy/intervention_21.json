I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who has been getting a lot of packages delivered. She put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" because she didn't want the delivery people to knock when leaving packages. She tried different ways to communicate this, but it didn't work until she used a sign with the courier logos. Then, when she ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it got cold. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points here are her intentions and actions. She wanted to avoid the noise for her baby, so she put up signs. Initially, the text-only signs didn't work, so she used a more visual sign with logos. The delivery person followed the sign's instructions, which led to the food being left outside and getting cold. The husband thinks they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nNow, considering the possible answers: A (they're wrong) or B (they're not). The question is whether expecting the delivery person not to knock is unreasonable. From the author's perspective, she had valid reasons (new baby, noise) and tried multiple times to communicate. The delivery person followed the instructions literally, which led to an unintended negative outcome. \n\nBut does that make the author in the wrong? The sign was meant for packages, not food. Maybe the author should have specified that the sign applies only to packages, not to food deliveries. However, the sign didn't mention that. The delivery person might not have realized the difference between a package and a food delivery. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person's job is to ensure the food is delivered hot. If they left it at the door without confirmation, that's a problem. The author might have communicated her needs for packages, but not for food. So, the mistake here could be on both sides. The delivery person didn't use common sense, but the author might not have clarified that the sign doesn't apply to food.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to prevent noise, which is understandable. The problem arose because the sign was too broad. The delivery person followed the instructions but didn't consider the context of food. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but she could have been clearer. The delivery person should have used common sense regardless of the sign. \n\nIn conclusion, since the author's main goal was to protect her baby from noise and she had a valid reason, she's not entirely at fault. The delivery person's actions led to the problem despite the sign, so the blame might not be solely on her. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
