I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a new mom, has been dealing with delivery people knocking on her door despite clear instructions not to. She put up signs and wrote notes in the delivery options, but they kept knocking. Then she put up a more visible sign with the courier logos, which worked in stopping the knocking. However, when a food delivery came, the person left the food at the door, which was ice cold because they didn't knock to let her in. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a legitimate reason to not want people knocking\u2014maybe she's a new mom, so constant interruptions are stressful. She tried multiple ways to communicate her request not to knock. The problem is that the delivery person followed the sign literally, but in doing so, caused the food to be cold. The question is whether the author is at fault for expecting the delivery person to use common sense instead of just following the sign.\n\nOn one hand, the delivery person's job is to deliver the food in a timely manner and ensure it's received properly. If the package can be left at the door without issue, maybe they could do that. But with food, especially if it's a hot meal, leaving it outside might compromise the temperature. The courier might not have considered that the author might need to come to the door to take the food immediately to keep it warm. The sign said not to knock, which the courier followed by not knocking, but maybe they should have used their judgment to check if the food needed to be handed over immediately.\n\nThe author's intention was to prevent the knocking, which she had been stressed about. However, by using a sign that's more explicit, maybe she didn't consider that some deliveries might require immediate attention. The husband's point is that by putting up the sign, they were asking for the consequence of the delivery being left outside. But the author argues that common sense should have made the delivery person realize that food needs to be handed over to avoid being cold.\n\nI think the key here is the balance between following instructions and applying common sense. The author made her request clear, but perhaps the delivery person should have assessed the situation. However, the sign was very direct, so maybe the delivery person wasn't at fault for following it literally. The author might be in the wrong if she expected the delivery to be handled in a way that contradicts the sign. On the other hand, if the sign was meant to prevent knocking but the delivery person could have used another method (like leaving it in a different spot or calling), maybe the author isn't at fault. It's a tricky situation, but I think the author isn't entirely wrong because the primary issue was the knocking, which the sign addressed. The delivery person's mistake was not considering that the food might need immediate handling. However, the author's sign focused on no knocking, so the delivery person might have followed that too strictly. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but there's a shared responsibility here.\n"
