I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who had a sign saying \"Do not Knock\" to avoid disturbing her baby during package deliveries. She had various signs and notes ignored until she used a sign with courier logos, which worked, but now the food delivery was left at the door and got cold. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's intention was to prevent knocks on the door to keep the baby from waking up. She tried multiple ways to communicate this, like handwritten signs and notes in checkout. When the new sign worked, it led to the food being left outside and getting cold. The delivery person didn't knock, just left it, which caused the problem.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nOn one hand, she made a reasonable effort to avoid disturbances for her baby. The sign was clear. But the consequence was that the food wasn't delivered properly, leading to being cold. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction but didn't check if it was appropriate for the current delivery (food vs. package). So maybe the author should have considered that food needs to be kept warm and thus knocking and delivering directly might be necessary. However, the sign didn't specify exceptions for food. \n\nHer husband's comment implies that using a sign they knew would lead to this outcome was asking for trouble. But the author might argue that the sign was just for packages, and the delivery person didn't use common sense to differentiate between a package and a perishable item like food. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the delivery person might have a duty to ensure the item is delivered in good condition. If the food needed to be kept warm, leaving it outside was a mistake. However, the author's sign was a clear instruction, and the delivery person followed it literally without considering the context. \n\nSo, the author's intent was reasonable, but the result was unintended. The delivery person might share some blame for not using judgment. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for the sign leading to this specific outcome. Since the sign was meant to prevent knocks for packages, not for food deliveries, maybe the author didn't anticipate the food delivery scenario. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong, as the sign was for a specific purpose. The delivery person should have recognized the food delivery and adjusted, but the author's sign didn't cover that. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
