I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has been putting up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages. But when she used a sign with pictures of the courier logos to get her packages delivered without knocking, it worked too well. Then, when ordering dinner, the delivery person left the food at the door without knocking, and it got ice cold. Her husband says they asked for it, and she's questioning if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a new mom, which might make her more sensitive to disturbances. She's been dealing with package deliveries where people ignored her \"Do not Knock\" signs, leading her to use a more visible sign with courier logos. That worked for packages, but now it backfired when the food delivery person followed the sign and left it outside in the cold.\n\nThe key points here are her intent and the consequences. She wanted to prevent people from knocking to avoid waking the baby, so she created a sign that was effective. However, the sign was generic enough that it might not differentiate between packages and food deliveries. The food delivery person followed the sign's instructions, leading to an unintended negative outcome.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, her intention wasn't malicious. She was trying to protect her baby's sleep and manage deliveries efficiently. The problem is that the sign didn't account for different types of deliveries (food vs. packages), which is a reasonable oversight given the context. The delivery person followed the sign correctly, so maybe she should have considered that the sign might be misinterpreted by others. However, expecting common sense to prevail is also a valid perspective. The author might need to adjust the sign to clarify its purpose for different types of deliveries, but the mistake here isn't necessarily her fault. She didn't intend to cause the food to be left out. So the answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
