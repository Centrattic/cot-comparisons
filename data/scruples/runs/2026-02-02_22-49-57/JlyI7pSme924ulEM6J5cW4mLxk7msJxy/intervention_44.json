I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a new mom, the author, has been getting packages delivered and kept asking that the deliverers not knock on the door. She put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" and also mentioned it in delivery notes, but they kept ignoring it. So she switched to a more visual sign with courier logos, which worked for packages. Then, when they ordered dinner, the deliverer didn't knock and just left it at the door, but the food got cold. The husband says they're asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nHmm. The key points here are whether the author's expectations were unreasonable. She made it clear not to knock for packages, but the food delivery was different. She might not have specified that the sign applies to food deliveries as well. The deliverer followed the sign's instructions literally, leading to the problem. The question is if she was wrong to expect the deliverer to use common sense in this case.\n\nWait, maybe the sign was intended for packages, not food. So she might have assumed that food deliveries would require knocking, but the deliverer followed the sign regardless. The author's mistake could be not clarifying that the sign was for packages only. Alternatively, the deliverer should have known that food requires immediate handoff. But the deliverer followed the written instructions. So maybe the author is partly at fault for not being specific enough. But then again, the sign's purpose was to prevent knocking for deliveries, so maybe the deliverer overstepped by not considering the nature of the delivery. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the sign was explicit about only applying to packages. If the sign didn't specify, the deliverer followed the instructions as written. So the author might be in the wrong for not making that distinction clear. However, if the sign was meant to be a general rule, but food is an exception that requires common sense, then the deliverer might be at fault. But the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nConsidering that the sign was about deliveries in general, maybe the author didn't consider that different types of deliveries require different handling. So the answer could be A (author is wrong) because she didn't specify the sign applied to packages only. Alternatively, B (not wrong) because the deliverer ignored previous instructions and the sign, leading to the problem. I'm a bit torn here. But I think the deliverer followed the sign, which was the author's own instruction. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering that food deliveries need a different approach. So answer A.\n"
