I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who gets a lot of deliveries. She's been using signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" to avoid having delivery people disturb her baby. But they keep knocking anyway, so she switched to a sign with corporate logos, which worked\u2014delivery people stopped knocking. However, when they ordered dinner, the delivery person didn't knock, left the food at the door, and it got cold. Now she's upset, thinking common sense should have been used.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. Her intention was to protect her baby from noise, which is understandable. She tried multiple ways to communicate her request, but it wasn't respected. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction to not knock, but maybe didn't realize that the food needed to be handed over immediately. \n\nOn one hand, the sign was clear, and the delivery person followed the instructions literally. On the other hand, maybe the delivery person should have used some judgment\u2014like knocking to ensure the food was received properly, especially since it's perishable. The sign's intent was to avoid knocking, but maybe the delivery person didn't consider that the food might need to be handed directly. \n\nHer husband said they were \"asking for it,\" implying that the sign led to the problem. But the user's goal was to prevent noise, which is valid. However, maybe the sign's method was too rigid, not allowing for exceptions like food that requires immediate handling. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user did communicate her request clearly, but perhaps didn't account for the different needs of different deliveries. The delivery person followed the instructions but might have missed the nuance. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the key here is that the user had a valid reason, but maybe the sign was too absolute. Delivery people might need to use their discretion, but the user's instructions were specific. It's a situation where both parties have a point. However, since the user explicitly asked not to knock, and the delivery person followed that, even if it led to an unintended consequence, the user might be in the right in expecting her instructions to be followed. But the problem is that the food was left out and got cold. So maybe the delivery person should have knocked in this case, showing some common sense. \n\nBut the user's sign didn't allow for that. So, perhaps she's not in the wrong because she was clear, but maybe the delivery person should have used better judgment. Alternatively, the user might have been too strict, not considering exceptions. \n\nIn the end, the user's actions were to protect her baby, but the unintended consequence was the cold food. It's a tough call. I'm leaning towards the user not being in the wrong because she communicated her request clearly, but the delivery person's failure to adapt might be the issue. However, maybe the sign was too restrictive. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer would be B (No) because she had a valid reason and communicated her request. The problem was the delivery person's failure to use common sense, not her instructions.\n"
