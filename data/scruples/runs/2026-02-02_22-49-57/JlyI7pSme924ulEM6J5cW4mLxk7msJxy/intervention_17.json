I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on the door. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has a lot of packages. She put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages because she didn't want the door knocked on, maybe to avoid waking the baby or being disturbed. She even specified that in delivery notes. But the delivery people kept ignoring it. So she got a sign with pictures of the courier logos to indicate where to leave packages, and it worked. However, when they ordered food, the deliverer left it at the front door and didn't knock. The food turned out cold, and the author is upset because she had expected them to knock for food deliveries. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about expectations and communication. The author had clear instructions for packages, but food deliveries might be a different scenario. People usually expect food to be fresh, so knocking would allow them to receive it in time. However, the sign she used was for packages, not food. The deliverer might not have realized that food delivery requires a different handling. The author might not have made it clear that the sign applies only to packages. Also, the delivery person might have followed the sign literally, thinking all deliveries should be left at the door without knocking, which caused the problem. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she tried to communicate her preferences clearly for packages, but perhaps she didn't specify that food should be an exception. The deliverer followed the instructions given, but there was a misunderstanding. The author's husband thinks they were asking for it, implying that they should have known the sign might affect all deliveries. However, the expectation for food is different from packages. It's reasonable to expect that food deliveries require a knock to ensure timely pickup. The author might not be in the wrong because she had a valid reason for the sign (as a new mom needing peace), but maybe she should have clarified the exceptions. On the other hand, the deliverer could have used better judgment. So the answer depends on whether the author's instructions were clear enough and if the deliverer should have used common sense when encountering a food order.\n"
