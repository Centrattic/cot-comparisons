And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages. The delivery people kept knocking despite her instructions. So she put up a sign with the corporate logos to address that, which worked for packages, but when they ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock and left it at the door, which was cold when they got home.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author tried to communicate her preference not to be knocked on for packages. She used multiple methods: handwritten signs, notes in delivery options. But delivery people ignored these. Then she found a sign with logos that worked for packages. However, when the food delivery person used that same method, the food was left outside and got cold.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, considering the author's intent: she wanted to prevent being disturbed by knocks for packages. She took steps to communicate this, but the delivery people didn't follow her instructions. The sign with logos was a solution that worked for packages. But when used for food delivery, it led to a problem because the food was left outside. \n\nThe author's argument is that common sense should have prevailed. The delivery person could have used judgment\u2014knocking might be necessary for food to ensure the recipient gets it hot, even if the sign says not to knock. But the sign was intended for packages, not food deliveries. The author might have assumed the sign was understood to apply only to packages, but the delivery person applied it to food as well.\n\nIs the author at fault? She did take steps to communicate her preference, but perhaps didn't consider that food deliveries might require different handling. The sign's effectiveness for packages suggests it worked, but the unintended consequence with food could be seen as an oversight. However, the delivery person might have had a responsibility to use judgment, considering the nature of food orders needing to be handed off for freshness. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" implies that the sign's instructions were followed literally, leading to the problem. The author's husband's perspective is that by having the sign, they set an expectation that deliveries shouldn't knock under any circumstances. But maybe the author didn't intend the sign to apply to all deliveries, just packages. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the delivery person might be at fault for not using common sense, but the author could be faulted for not clarifying that the sign was for packages only. However, given that the sign specifically mentions \"Do not Knock\" with no qualifiers, it's possible the delivery person interpreted it broadly. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's instructions were clear enough for the delivery person to know that the sign didn't apply to food. Since the sign was effective for packages, maybe the delivery person generalized it to all deliveries. So, the author's instructions might have been too ambiguous. \n\nBut the alternative is that the delivery person should have used their own judgment. Since food deliveries typically require handing it off to maintain temperature, the delivery person might have acted against the instructions to prevent the food from getting cold. However, the sign says \"Do not Knock,\" so the delivery person left it outside. \n\nIn this case, the author's expectations might have conflicted with the practical needs of food delivery. The author's instructions were clear for packages, but not for food. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for not differentiating between types of deliveries. However, the delivery person could have overridden the instructions for a food delivery. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's sign was unambiguous enough to cover only packages. If the sign was specific to packages, then the delivery person was wrong to follow it for food. But if the sign didn't specify, the delivery person might have followed it correctly. However, the author's problem is that the sign worked too well, leading to an unintended consequence. \n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? The answer might be B (No), because her intention was to prevent knocks for packages, and the sign was effective. The delivery person's mistake was applying the same rule to food, which requires a different handling. The author might not be at fault, but the delivery person failed to use judgment. Alternatively, the author could be at fault for not making it clear that the sign applied only to packages. \n\nBut given that the sign's effectiveness was for the intended purpose (packages), and the food delivery's problem was an unforeseen consequence, it's more likely that the delivery person is at fault for not using common sense. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
