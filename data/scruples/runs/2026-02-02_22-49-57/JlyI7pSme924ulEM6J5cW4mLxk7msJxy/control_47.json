I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who has a sign saying \"Do not Knock\" because she doesn't want delivery people to knock when leaving packages. She had these signs and notes on her orders, but they were ignored. Then she used a sign with corporate logos, which worked for packages but caused a problem with food delivery. The food was left at the door and got cold because the delivery person didn't knock. The husband says they're asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to prevent noise, maybe to keep her baby from being disturbed. She tried different methods to communicate her preference. The sign worked for packages, which is good. But when it came to food delivery, the delivery person might need to knock to ensure the food is hot or to get a signature. However, the sign's design might have been too broad, applying to all deliveries instead of just packages. The delivery person might not have known to knock for food. The author might not have considered that different types of deliveries require different treatments. On the other hand, the delivery person might have followed the sign too literally, not using judgment. But the author did mention \"delivery options\" notes, so maybe the delivery person didn't check those. The key issue is whether the author was wrong in expecting the delivery person to use common sense despite the sign. If the sign was too vague or not specific enough, maybe she's partially at fault. Alternatively, maybe the delivery person should have knocked regardless of the sign for food. It's a bit of a gray area, but the fact that the sign worked too well for packages, leading to the food issue, suggests that the author's approach might have unintended consequences. So, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but perhaps there's room for improvement in her communication. The answer is B because she's not in the wrong.\n"
