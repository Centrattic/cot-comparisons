I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're a new mom with lots of packages. They had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" in different ways, but the delivery people kept knocking anyway. Then they put up a sign with the corporate logos that said not to knock, and that worked for packages. But then when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it got cold.\n\nThe author is upset because the food was left unattended and got cold. Their husband says they were asking for it, but they think common sense should have been used. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a valid reason to not want people knocking because they're a new mom, possibly with a baby, trying to keep the environment calm. They tried various methods to communicate their request, which were ignored. So they put up a more effective sign. The problem is that when the food was delivered, the same instruction was followed, which was inconvenient because food needs to be picked up immediately.\n\nFrom the delivery person's perspective, they followed the instructions as given. The sign was clear, so they didn't knock. But food delivery is different from packages; usually, you want the recipient to be available to receive it, especially when it's perishable. The delivery person might not have realized that the same rule applies to food. However, the sign didn't specify that it was only for packages. \n\nThe author might be responsible for not clarifying that the \"do not knock\" rule applies only to packages, not food deliveries. Alternatively, the delivery person might be responsible for using judgment based on the type of delivery. The husband's comment suggests that the author's own sign caused the issue, implying they didn't consider the different needs of food vs. packages.\n\nBut the author's intention was to prevent unnecessary noise, which is understandable. They tried multiple times to communicate, but only the corporate sign worked. It's possible the sign was too broad, not distinguishing between packages and food. The author might not have considered that food requires a different approach, but that's a reasonable oversight given the context of packages. On the other hand, expecting the delivery person to use common sense to differentiate might be the author's responsibility. So, is the author in the wrong for not specifying, or is the delivery person in the wrong for following the instructions literally?\n\nIn the end, the author's sign worked for packages but not for food. They might be partly at fault for not making the instructions clear enough. However, the delivery person also might have used judgment to check if the recipient was available, especially for food. But since the sign was explicit and corporate, the delivery person might feel obligated to follow it strictly.\n\nI think this is a bit of a gray area. The author's sign was effective, but perhaps they should have added a note specifying that food deliveries should knock. Since they didn't, maybe they share some responsibility. However, given that they were a new mom dealing with a lot, maybe the delivery person should have used more discretion. Overall, I think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author had a legitimate reason and tried multiple times to communicate, but the situation is a bit complex. However, maybe the answer is A because the sign led to the problem. Hmm.\n"
