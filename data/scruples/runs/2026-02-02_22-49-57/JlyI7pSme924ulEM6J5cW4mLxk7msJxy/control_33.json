I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" to prevent delivery people from knocking on her door, which she did because she didn't want to risk her baby hearing it. She tried various signs until one with corporate logos worked, but then when a food delivery came, they left it at the door, and the food was cold. She's upset because she thought common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The main issue is whether her signs led to the delivery person not knocking and thus leaving the food at the door, causing it to be cold. The author expects that the delivery person should have used common sense and not left the food unattended, even if the sign said not to knock. \n\nOn one hand, the author had a legitimate reason for not wanting to be knocked on the door, especially as a new mom. She tried multiple times to communicate her preference, and the sign with the corporate logos was effective. However, the sign might have been too broad, applying to all deliveries, including food, which requires timely handling. The delivery person might have followed the sign's instruction literally without considering that food needs to be handed off immediately to keep it warm.\n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests that the sign caused the issue. The author argues that common sense should have been used. The problem here is the ambiguity in the sign. If the sign was specifically for package deliveries and not food, that would be different. But since it's a general \"Do not knock\" sign for all deliveries, the delivery person might not know that food is an exception. The delivery person might not have the means to keep the food warm while waiting, so leaving it at the door is their standard procedure when no one is present to receive it. \n\nThe author's responsibility here is in how the sign was worded. If she wanted food deliveries to be handled differently, she should have clarified that on the sign. The sign's effectiveness in preventing knocks for packages was good, but it didn't account for the difference between packages and perishable food. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because her sign didn't specify exceptions for food deliveries, leading to the cold food incident. However, the delivery person also has a responsibility to ensure the food is delivered properly, perhaps by calling or using another method to get the recipient's attention without knocking. \n\nBut the sign said not to knock, so the delivery person had to follow that. If the sign didn't allow for other communication methods, like calling, then the delivery person was left with no option but to leave the food. The author's request was clear, but the real-world application led to an unintended consequence. The author's intentions were good, but she might not have considered all scenarios. The delivery person followed the instructions, even if the outcome wasn't ideal. So maybe the author is not in the wrong because she was clear with her instructions, but the delivery person should have found an alternative to ensure the food's temperature. However, it's possible that the delivery person wasn't trained to handle such exceptions, so it's a shared responsibility. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is intent and whether the expectations were reasonable. The author's intent was to avoid knocks for packages, which is reasonable. However, applying the same rule to food might not be reasonable because food delivery requires immediate handling. The sign didn't differentiate, so the author might be at fault for not making that distinction clear. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because she didn't specify exceptions. Alternatively, if the sign was meant for all deliveries without exception, then the delivery person followed instructions, so the author's expectations were too broad. \n\nBut the user's husband said they were asking for it, implying that the sign caused the problem. The author might not have considered that her sign would lead to such an outcome. The answer hinges on whether the sign's instructions were too broad. Since the sign used corporate logos, maybe it was intended for package deliveries from those companies, and the food delivery was from a different service. But the image isn't visible, so we can't confirm. Assuming the sign applied to all deliveries, including food, then the author didn't account for that. Hence, the answer might be A. However, if the sign was only for package deliveries, then the delivery person was following the wrong instructions. But the user didn't specify, so we have to assume the sign was for all deliveries. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong for not considering that the sign could affect food deliveries and not specifying exceptions. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
