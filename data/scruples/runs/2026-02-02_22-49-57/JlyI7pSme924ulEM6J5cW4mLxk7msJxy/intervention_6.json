I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a new mom, who had packages delivered and kept getting knocked on the door despite her instructions not to. She put up signs with \"Do not Knock\" and also noted it in delivery options, but it didn't work. Then she found a sign with corporate logos that worked for packages, but when she ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door, and it was cold because they didn't knock.\n\nSo, the author is upset because the food was late and cold. The sign worked for packages but not for food. The key point is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock for food but not for packages. \n\nFirst, the author had specific instructions for packages, which the delivery people ignored. Then, the sign with the logos (which the user linked) probably includes a section for food delivery. The sign might say something like \"Knock for food, leave packages at door.\" But in this case, the food delivery person left it at the door as per the sign, but the food was cold. The author expected them to knock for food, but the sign might have been ambiguous. \n\nWait, the user says the sign worked too well. Maybe the sign was intended to differentiate between packages and food. But the delivery person might have misread it or assumed that since it's a food delivery, they should leave it at the door. However, food is time-sensitive, so knocking might be necessary to ensure it's fresh. The problem is that the sign didn't clearly indicate that food should be knocked. \n\nThe author's intention was to stop people from knocking for packages, but maybe the sign didn't specify that food should require knocking. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction to leave at the door, but that led to a cold meal. The author is upset because they expected common sense\u2014knowing that food needs to be handed over. The husband said they were asking for it, implying that the sign was too broad. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The sign was meant for packages, but maybe the author didn't consider that food delivery requires a different instruction. By putting up a sign that didn't specify, she might have been unclear. However, she had previous issues with people ignoring her \"Do not Knock\" signs for packages, so she tried a different approach. But in the case of food, the delivery person followed the sign's instruction literally, leading to a problem. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the sign clearly differentiated between package and food delivery. If the sign only said \"Do not Knock\" and didn't specify that food should be knocked, then the delivery person acted correctly based on the sign. However, the author's expectation was that food should be knocked, which the sign didn't explicitly state. So, the author might be in the wrong for not making the instructions clearer for food. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense for food delivery. \n\nBut the sign included corporate logos, which might have been for specific services. If the sign had separate sections, like \"Leave packages at door. Knock for food,\" then the delivery person might have followed that. But if the sign was a single instruction, it's ambiguous. \n\nIn the AITA context, the author's mistake might be that she didn't clarify that food is an exception. The delivery person followed the sign as written, but the author didn't consider that food requires a different approach. So, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) for not being clear. But if the sign was meant to apply only to packages, but the delivery person applied it to food, then the delivery person is at fault. \n\nThe user says the sign worked too well, implying that maybe the sign was too broad. The husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests that the author's solution had unintended consequences. So, the author's responsibility was to make the instructions clear for different types of deliveries. Since she didn't specify, the delivery person acted on the sign's instruction. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not differentiating between package and food delivery instructions.\n"
