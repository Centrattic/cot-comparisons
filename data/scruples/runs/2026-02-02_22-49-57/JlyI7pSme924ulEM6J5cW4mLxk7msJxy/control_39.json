I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who has been dealing with delivery people knocking on her door despite her clear instructions not to. She put up signs and wrote notes, but they kept knocking until she used a sign with the company logos, which worked. But now, when a food delivery came, the person left it at the door without knocking, leading to the food being cold. The author is upset about that and is questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nHmm. So the main points here are about the author's attempts to stop deliveries from knocking, which were successful, but now the consequence is that the food wasn't warmed up. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a valid reason to not want people knocking\u2014maybe because she's a new mom and wants to avoid disturbing the baby or being interrupted. She tried multiple ways to communicate her preference, and the sign with the company logos worked. That implies that the delivery people were following the instructions given on the sign. So when the food delivery person saw the sign, they left the package at the door, which is what was requested. However, food delivery usually expects the person to knock or call to ensure the food is received hot. So the problem here is that the sign, which was effective for packages, didn't account for food deliveries, which have different handling requirements.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she set up the sign to prevent knocking, which was for packages, but maybe didn't realize that food delivery requires a different approach. The delivery person followed the sign's instructions to not knock, leading to a cold meal. The author's intention was to stop the knocking, which she succeeded in, but the unintended consequence was the food being left unattended. The question is whether she should have foreseen that the same sign would apply to all deliveries, including food, which typically needs immediate handoff.\n\nOn one hand, she communicated her instructions clearly, and the delivery person followed them. On the other hand, food deliveries are different from regular packages, so maybe the sign should have specified. The author might have assumed that the sign was for non-food items, but the delivery person didn't make that distinction. The husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests that by using the sign, they invited that outcome. The author argues that common sense should have been used, but the delivery person just followed the written instruction without considering the type of delivery.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was not differentiating between package and food delivery instructions. The sign was effective for its original purpose (stopping knocks for packages), but it inadvertently affected food deliveries, which require a different handling. Therefore, the author is not entirely in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to follow the sign's instructions, but maybe she should have realized that food deliveries need a different approach. However, since the sign was clear and the delivery person adhered to it, the responsibility might lie with the delivery person for not using judgment in this specific case. Alternatively, the author might be in the wrong for not anticipating the different needs of food versus package deliveries. But since the sign was about \"Do not knock,\" which was a general instruction, the delivery person followed it literally. The answer might be B (No), as the author had a valid reason and communicated clearly, but maybe the delivery person should have used common sense. However, the delivery person's job is to follow instructions, so perhaps the author is not in the wrong.\n"
