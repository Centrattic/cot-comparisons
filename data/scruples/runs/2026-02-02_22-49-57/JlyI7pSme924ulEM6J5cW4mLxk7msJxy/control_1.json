I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's a new mom and gets a lot of packages. She's been putting up signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" because she didn't want the delivery people to knock on the door. But they kept knocking, so she got a sign with corporate logos that worked. However, when she ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it was cold when they found out. She's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to stop the delivery people from knocking, which she found annoying. She tried multiple ways\u2014handwritten signs, notes in checkout. When the visual sign worked, it led to this issue with the food delivery. The problem is that leaving a perishable item at the door without knocking might have caused it to get cold if it was left too long. The delivery person might have left it there because they saw the \"Do not knock\" sign, so they followed it, but maybe the food was supposed to be handed off directly.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, she clearly communicated her request not to knock, which is her right. On the other hand, maybe she should have considered that some deliveries, like food, require a different approach. For example, maybe she should have specified in the delivery notes for food that she wanted the delivery person to knock or call the doorbell. Alternatively, she might have known that the sign applied to packages but not to food deliveries. But she mentioned that the sign had corporate logos, which might be aimed at all deliveries, not just packages. The delivery person might not have distinguished between a package and a food order, so they just left it at the door as per the sign.\n\nIs she at fault for not making an exception for food? Or is the delivery person responsible for using common sense, even if a sign says not to knock? The sign might have been a bit too broad. If she wanted to avoid knocking for packages but still wanted food delivered to her, maybe she should have made that distinction clear on the sign. But the sign was effective for stopping knocks, so she might not have anticipated this issue. The husband says they were asking for it, implying that they should have known the sign would apply to all deliveries, including food. The author argues that common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should have recognized that food needs to be handed over, not left at the door.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sign was a clear instruction. The delivery person followed it, leading to the problem. However, the sign might not have been specific enough. The author could be in the wrong if she didn't consider that some deliveries require interaction. But the delivery person should also use judgment, especially with perishable items. The question is whether the author's request was reasonable. Since she explicitly asked not to knock, and the delivery person followed it, but the outcome was negative, maybe the author is partially at fault for not specifying exceptions. However, the sign's effectiveness in stopping knocks was the main goal, and the unintended consequence was a cold meal. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on whether the sign's instructions were too broad. If the author wanted to avoid knocking but still get hot food, she should have clarified for food deliveries. Since she didn't, the sign might have caused the issue. So, the answer could be A (yes, in the wrong) because she didn't account for the different nature of food deliveries. Alternatively, if the delivery person should have used common sense despite the sign, then B (not in the wrong). But the sign was a direct instruction, so maybe the delivery person just followed it. The author might be in the wrong for not anticipating that.\n"
