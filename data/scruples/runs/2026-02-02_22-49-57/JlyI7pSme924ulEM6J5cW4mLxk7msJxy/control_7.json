I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" for deliveries. The signs worked for packages but then a food delivery left it at the door, which got cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should've been used.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author had specific instructions to not knock, which were ignored previously. So they created a sign with the courier logos to address that. It worked for packages, but now with food, the delivery person left it at the door. The food was late and cold. \n\nSo the main points here are: Did the author's actions lead to the problem? The author's intention was to prevent knocking, which they did. The sign worked as intended for packages, but food delivery might require different handling. Food is time-sensitive, so the delivery person should maybe bring it inside even if the sign says not to knock. But the sign didn't specify that. \n\nThe author's instructions were clear for packages, but maybe they didn't consider that food delivery needs a different approach. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction to not knock, so left it at the door. The author might have expected the delivery person to use judgment despite the sign. But the sign was explicit, so the delivery person might not have been at fault. \n\nIs the author at fault? They set clear instructions, but perhaps didn't account for varying delivery types. The husband's point is that they should have known the sign would cause issues with food. However, the author's primary concern was packages, and they might not have anticipated the food delivery problem. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's sign was to prevent knocking, which worked. The delivery person followed the instructions, leading to the cold food. So maybe the author is not in the wrong because they followed the platform's options for delivery notes and created a sign to enforce it. The delivery person might have over-followed the instructions without using common sense. The author's sign was effective, but maybe they should have added a note for food. However, the sign didn't mention that, so it's unclear. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author tried to follow the proper channels and the sign was effective. The delivery person's strict adherence caused an issue, but that's on the delivery person's judgment. The author's intent was to prevent knocking, which they achieved. The food issue is a side effect, but not necessarily their fault.\n"
