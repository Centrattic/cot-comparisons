I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who gets a lot of packages. She's tried multiple times to tell delivery people not to knock, using notes both handwritten and on the checkout forms. But they kept knocking anyway. Frustrated, she made a sign with the courier logos that says \"Do not knock\" and it worked for packages. But then when they ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock and left it at the door, which was left there for too long, making the food cold.\n\nThe user is asking if she's in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock. She thinks common sense should have prevailed. The husband says they were asking for it. \n\nSo, first, the author's intention was to prevent knocking for packages, which she tried to communicate clearly. The sign worked for packages but not for the food delivery. The food delivery person saw the sign and didn't knock, leading to the problem. \n\nNow, the key points: Did the author's sign apply to food deliveries? The sign had courier logos, so maybe the food delivery service wasn't covered. But the sign was up in a visible place, so the delivery person might have assumed it applied to all deliveries. However, the author had previously specified \"Do not knock\" in the delivery notes for packages. For food, maybe she didn't specify, but the sign was a general instruction. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the sign was meant for all deliveries, then maybe she didn't consider that food deliveries require immediate attention, so knocking might be necessary. But she thought the sign covered all cases. Her intention was to prevent knocking, but the delivery person followed the sign literally and didn't knock, leading to the food being cold. \n\nThe user argues that common sense should have been used. The delivery person might have known that food needs to be delivered immediately, so even with the sign, they should have knocked. On the other hand, the sign was clear, so the delivery person might have thought not to knock. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author tried to communicate her preferences multiple times but was ignored. She adjusted by using a sign. However, the sign might have been too broad or not specific to food. The food delivery person followed the sign but didn't use discretion. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not, because she made her preferences clear through multiple methods. The delivery person's failure to use judgment could be their fault. However, the sign might have been misleading. \n\nAlternatively, the author might have assumed the sign would only apply to packages, not food. But the sign didn't specify, so the delivery person had no way to know. The husband's point is that they were asking for it, implying that the sign's instructions were too absolute. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer hinges on whether the sign's instructions were too broad. If the author intended to exclude food, she might have been unclear. But since she tried different methods and the sign worked for packages, maybe the delivery person's mistake was not using common sense for the food delivery. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
