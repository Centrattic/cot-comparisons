I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock instead of leaving the package at the door. The situation involves a new mom who's been dealing with delivery people knocking a lot, which she doesn't want because of the baby. She had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" but they were ignored. So she put up a new sign with specific courier logos, which worked in preventing knocks, but now the food was left at the door and got cold.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to stop deliveries from knocking, which they did successfully. The problem arises when the food delivery person follows the sign and leaves the package at the door, leading to the food being cold. The key points here are the author's responsibility versus the delivery person's judgment. \n\nThe author set clear instructions (written in the checkout notes and on signs), but the delivery person didn't consider the context of food delivery, which might require different handling than packages. The author might argue that the sign was meant for packages, not food. However, the sign with the courier logos could be interpreted as applying to all deliveries, including food. \n\nThe husband's comment suggests he thinks they were asking for this outcome. The author believes common sense should have been used. The delivery person might not have realized the food needed to be kept warm, so left it at the door as per the sign. \n\nIs the author at fault for having conflicting outcomes? She wanted to stop knocks, which the sign did, but didn't anticipate the side effect with food. It's a bit of a dilemma. The signs were to prevent noise, so the main issue isn't with her, but maybe she should have made it clearer that food deliveries should still be knocked. However, the delivery person's job is to follow the instructions given, even if there's an unintended consequence. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for setting up the signs as per her needs, but maybe she should have considered adding an exception for food. However, the delivery person's adherence to the sign led to the problem. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
