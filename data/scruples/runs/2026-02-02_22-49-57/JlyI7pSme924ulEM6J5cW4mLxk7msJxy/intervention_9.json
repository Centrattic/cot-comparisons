I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The situation involves a new mom who's had issues with packages being left at the door despite her instructions. She put up a sign saying not to knock, and then when she ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock, left it outside, and it got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to prevent packages from being left outside, which she had a reason for\u2014maybe she's a new mom who's not always there to answer the door or can't have strangers approaching. She took steps to communicate her preferences clearly with signs and notes. However, when it came to a food delivery, the result wasn't what she wanted because the food was left outside and got cold. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. She communicated \"Do not knock\" clearly, but maybe the delivery person interpreted that as not needing to knock at all, even for food. The sign might have been more effective for packages but not appropriate for food deliveries where promptness and temperature are crucial. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If she instructed no knocking, the delivery person followed that instruction, which worked for packages but not for food. The problem arises because the food's quality was affected. However, the author might not have considered that the instructions might apply to packages but not to food orders. Or maybe the delivery person should have used common sense to knock despite the sign for food, which is time-sensitive. \n\nThe husband's comment \"we were asking for it\" suggests he thinks they should have anticipated the problem. But the author argues that common sense should prevail, implying that the delivery person should have made a judgment call. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the instructions were clear and followed, the delivery person isn't at fault, but the author might be in the wrong for not considering that the same instructions might not apply to food. However, the author's intent was to ensure packages were left safely, not to risk food quality. So maybe the conflict is between following instructions literally versus applying contextual judgment. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's instructions were too broad. If she didn't specify that the no-knocking rule applies only to packages and not to food, the delivery person isn't wrong for following the general instruction. But she should have realized that food requires a different approach. Therefore, she might share some responsibility, making her possibly in the wrong. However, if the sign was more about package delivery and the food delivery was a different context, maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nBut the main issue is that she expected the delivery person to knock for food, even though the sign said not to. The delivery person did as instructed, so the author's expectation wasn't met because she didn't differentiate between package and food deliveries in her instructions. Hence, she might be at fault for not clarifying the instructions.\n"
