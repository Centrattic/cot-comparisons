I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom dealing with packages and deliveries. She's had issues where delivery people knock despite her clear instructions not to. She put up a sign with pictures of courier logos that worked for packages, but now it backfired when a food delivery person left a cold meal at the door. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, she tried multiple times to communicate her preference not to be knocked on, using both handwritten signs and notes in delivery options. The food delivery person might have followed the sign's instruction literally, not realizing that food needs to be handed over promptly. Her intention was to avoid people knocking, but food delivery usually requires interaction to ensure the meal is hot and properly received. \n\nThe key here is whether her sign was too broad. If the sign didn't differentiate between package deliveries and food deliveries, the person might not have known to make an exception. However, the sign used pictures of the corporate logos, which might have been intended for package deliveries, not food. The delivery person might have misinterpreted the sign's purpose, thinking it applied to all deliveries. \n\nThe user's husband says they were asking for it, implying that the sign's effectiveness for packages led to this unintended consequence. The user argues that common sense should prevail. But common sense might not be universal; the delivery person might not have considered that food delivery requires a different approach. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? She tried to communicate clearly but maybe didn't specify enough. However, the delivery person also didn't use common sense to adjust for food delivery needs. The responsibility isn't entirely on her. The sign worked for her intended purpose (no knocking for packages), but this was a different scenario. Therefore, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
