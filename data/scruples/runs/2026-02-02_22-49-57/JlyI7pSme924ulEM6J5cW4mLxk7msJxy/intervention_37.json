I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who had a sign saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, which worked initially, but then caused an issue when a food delivery person left a cold meal at the door.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author wanted to avoid being disturbed by delivery people, so they put up signs. The signs were effective in preventing knocks, but when a food delivery happened, the driver left the food without knocking, leading to a cold meal. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nNow, considering the rules of the AITA format. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The main question is whether the author's actions were reasonable.\n\nThe sign was specific to packages, not food deliveries. The author might have assumed that food delivery would still not require knocking, but maybe food deliveries need immediate attention to keep the food warm. The author's intent was to avoid being disturbed, but they might not have considered the different needs between package and food delivery. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction but it led to an unintended negative outcome.\n\nIs the author at fault? They tried to communicate their preference, but perhaps didn't consider that food deliveries require a different approach. The sign might have been too broad. However, the author did try to specify \"Do not Knock\" in multiple places. The delivery person might have exercised better judgment instead of strictly following the sign. The husband's comment suggests that the sign was the cause, but the author believes the delivery person should have used common sense.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and whether the action was reasonable. The author's intent was to avoid being disturbed, which is understandable, especially as a new mom. However, the sign's application to food deliveries might have been an oversight. But the delivery person's responsibility is to ensure the food is delivered properly. Maybe the author is partially at fault for not differentiating between package and food deliveries in the sign, but the delivery person should have known not to leave a perishable item without checking. So, is it a shared fault? But the question is about the author being in the wrong. The author's actions were intended to prevent disturbance, so maybe not in the wrong. The delivery person failed to use judgment. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
