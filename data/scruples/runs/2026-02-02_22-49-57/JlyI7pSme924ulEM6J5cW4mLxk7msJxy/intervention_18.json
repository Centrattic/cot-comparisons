I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a new mom who's had packages knocked on her door despite clear instructions to not knock. She put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" and also used delivery notes, but people kept ignoring them. Then she put up a sign with courier logos that effectively stopped the knocking. But when she ordered dinner, the delivery person left it outside, and it got cold.\n\nThe key points here are: the author tried multiple ways to communicate her preference not to be knocked on, which was being ignored. The sign with the logos worked for packages, but when it came to food delivery, the same approach led to the food being left outside and getting cold. The author is questioning if she's the asshole for expecting the delivery person to use common sense in this case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's expectations are reasonable. She had a legitimate reason to not want to be disturbed\u2014being a new mom, maybe with a baby inside. She made her preferences clear through written notes and signs. However, food delivery is different from packages. Packages can be left outside, but food is time-sensitive and requires immediate attention. The sign was meant to stop knocking for packages, but the delivery person might not have realized that the same rule applies to food. The sign didn't specify different treatments for different types of deliveries. So maybe the sign was too broad, leading to confusion. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction literally, resulting in the food being left outside. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? She had a consistent instruction, but perhaps didn't consider that different delivery types might need different handling. However, she did expect the delivery person to use common sense, which might not be fair if the instructions were explicit. On the other hand, expecting someone to read between the lines or apply judgment in a rule-based situation could be unreasonable. The sign says \"Do not knock,\" which is a clear instruction, but maybe the solution was to have separate instructions for packages versus food. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests he thinks the sign caused the problem. The author's frustration is understandable because the food was left cold. However, the sign's effectiveness for packages might have been a trade-off she wasn't expecting. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the delivery person followed the sign's instructions literally, but the author might have been responsible for ensuring that the sign didn't misapply to food deliveries. The core issue is whether the sign was too broad. If the author wanted food to be brought in, she should have specified that. Alternatively, maybe the sign should have exceptions. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because she had a valid need to avoid being disturbed and tried to communicate it. However, the solution might have been flawed in not differentiating between package and food deliveries. So while her intentions are reasonable, the outcome wasn't what she wanted. The main question is whether she's the asshole. Since she tried to communicate her needs and the sign worked as intended (for packages), but the food situation was an oversight, she's not in the wrong. The problem is a misunderstanding of instructions that were clear for one purpose but not the other. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
