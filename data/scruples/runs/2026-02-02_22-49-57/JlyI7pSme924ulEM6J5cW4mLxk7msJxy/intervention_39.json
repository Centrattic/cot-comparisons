I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking even though she had \"Do not Knock\" signs. She tried various methods to communicate this, but the deliveries kept knocking. Then she used a sign with the corporate logos, which worked but caused a problem when the food delivery was left at the door and got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions and actions of the author. The main goal here is to prevent the door from being knocked on, especially since she's a new mom, which might mean she's dealing with a baby and not wanting to be disturbed. She made clear signs and notes, but they were ignored. So she found a more effective sign, which worked for packages. But when a food delivery came, the person left it at the door without knocking, leading to it being cold. The question is whether she's in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to handle this situation differently.\n\nThe key points are: 1) She made repeated efforts to communicate \"do not knock,\" which were ignored. 2) She used a more effective sign that works for packages but not for food. 3) The delivery person followed the sign's instruction but caused an inconvenience.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, she wanted to avoid being knocked on, which is reasonable. However, the sign might not have been specific enough to differentiate between packages and food deliveries. The delivery person might not have realized that the \"do not knock\" applies to packages but not to food, especially if the sign is general. The author might not have considered that food deliveries might require a different handling (like leaving it out might not be suitable). But on the other hand, she can't be expected to know that the delivery person would misinterpret the sign. The sign worked for packages, so maybe the delivery person didn't check if it was food.\n\nThe husband's comment suggests he thinks they asked for it, implying that their own sign caused the problem. But the author's intention was to prevent disturbance, which is understandable. The delivery person might have acted correctly based on the sign, but the outcome was a cold meal. The question is whether the author's method was reasonable. \n\nIn such situations, the onus is on the delivery person to use common sense. If the item is food, leaving it at the door might not be appropriate. However, the author might not have considered that the sign's instructions are too broad. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she was trying to protect her environment, but the sign's clarity could be an issue. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment about the food. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be B (No), because the author's intention was to avoid disturbance, which is valid, and the delivery person might have misapplied the instructions. However, the sign's lack of specificity could be a factor. But since the author took reasonable steps to communicate her preference, and the delivery person's action, while following the sign, led to an unintended consequence, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem arises from the sign's ambiguity, not her intent.\n"
