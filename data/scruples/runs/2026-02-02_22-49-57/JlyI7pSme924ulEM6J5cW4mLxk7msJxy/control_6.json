I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door despite her repeated instructions to not do so. She put up signs and wrote notes, but they were ignored. Finally, a visual sign with courier logos worked, but now there's a problem. She ordered dinner, and the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, leading to it being cold. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, the key points: She tried multiple times to communicate \"do not knock,\" which was ignored. The sign with logos worked for packages, but food delivery required interaction. The delivery person didn't knock, left it outside, causing the food to be cold. Her husband thinks they asked for it, but she thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nNow, considering the situation. The user's main issue is with the knocking for packages, which she found annoying, especially as a new mom. She took steps to prevent it. When she ordered food, she probably expected the same \"no knock\" policy, but food usually requires someone to answer the door. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, not realizing that food delivery needs a different approach. The user didn't specify \"do not knock\" for food orders, maybe assuming the sign applied to all deliveries. The delivery person might have been following the sign strictly without considering the context. The user might be at fault for not making exceptions or clarifying that the sign was for packages only. However, the sign's effectiveness for packages suggests it's a solution she needed. The delivery person's mistake was in not using judgment, but the user's sign didn't account for food deliveries. It's a bit of a gray area. The user's intention was to avoid disturbances, but the consequence was a cold meal. The husband's comment about asking for it implies that the user's sign led to the outcome. However, the user might not be entirely wrong because the delivery person should recognize that food needs a different handling. But since she didn't specify, maybe she's partly responsible. So, the answer could lean towards her not being in the wrong entirely, but there's some nuance. The main issue is communication breakdown\u2014she didn't clarify exceptions, and the delivery person followed the sign without adapting. Given the context, the answer might be B, not in the wrong, but with a note about clearer communication.\n"
