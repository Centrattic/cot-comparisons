I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has been getting packages delivered and has repeatedly asked not to knock, both with signs and in delivery notes. When she put up a sign that worked for packages but caused a problem with food delivery, the deliverer left the food at the door even though it was cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. She's a new mom, which implies she might be dealing with a baby who gets easily disturbed. She's taken multiple steps to communicate her preference not to be knocked on, which suggests she values peace and quiet, especially important for a baby's sleep. The signs and notes were effective for packages, so she likely thought they were clear. However, when ordering food, the deliverer followed the same instructions, leading to a problem because the food was left outside and got cold.\n\nNow, the key issue is whether expecting the deliverer to knock despite the sign is unreasonable. The author didn't specify different instructions for food versus packages, so the deliverer might have followed the same rule. The problem arises because food delivery typically requires more immediate attention than packages. The deliverer might not have considered that the \"do not knock\" rule applies differently to perishable items. \n\nOn the other hand, the deliverer's job is to follow customer instructions as given. If the author didn't specify different handling for food, the deliverer was just following the existing guidelines. The husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests he believes the author's own signs caused the issue. The author argues that common sense should have prevailed, meaning the deliverer should have realized that not knocking for food might lead to spoilage.\n\nBut is the deliverer expected to use common sense beyond the written instructions? In many delivery scenarios, especially in busy areas, couriers rely strictly on written instructions to manage their routes efficiently. They might not have the time or ability to assess each delivery's urgency. However, the author's sign was somewhat ambiguous if it didn't differentiate between package types. The sign might have been intended for packages, not food, but since it was visible, the deliverer followed it without clarification.\n\nThe author's mistake was not specifying different instructions for different types of deliveries. By using a general \"do not knock\" sign, she created a situation where the deliverer applied the same rule to all deliveries, including food, which should have been exceptions. Therefore, the author is partially responsible for not clarifying that exceptions exist for food. However, the deliverer could also be in the wrong for not recognizing the exception, but in logistics, strict adherence to written instructions is often necessary.\n\nIn conclusion, while the deliverer followed the given instructions, the author didn't provide clear exceptions for food deliveries, leading to an unintended consequence. So, the answer is that the author is partially at fault for not specifying different handling for food, making her the asshole in this scenario. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
