I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is the asshole (AITA) for expecting the food deliverer to knock on their door. \n\nSo the situation: She's a new mom with lots of packages. She had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" which were ignored. She wrote it in delivery notes too. Then she put up a new sign with courier logos, and it worked. But then when they ordered dinner, it was late, and the delivery person left it at the door. The food was ice cold, and she's upset. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nHmm, first, her initial issue was that people kept knocking despite her instructions. She tried multiple times to communicate \"Do not knock,\" but it didn't work. So she took a more visual approach with the sign. The sign worked for packages, but when a food delivery came, they followed the sign's instruction and left it at the door, which led to a problem because hot food left unattended can get cold and maybe not safe.\n\nNow the question is, is she in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock? Well, she had the sign up, which was meant to prevent knocking. But food delivery might be different from packages because food is time-sensitive and needs to be handed over to ensure it's still hot or safe. The delivery person followed the written instruction (the sign) but didn't use judgment for the specific case of food delivery. \n\nSo, considering the scenario, she wanted to stop the knocking, which makes sense, especially as a new mom who might need quiet. However, using a delivery method that's unsuitable for perishable items like food might be an oversight. The sign was effective but perhaps not comprehensive enough. Maybe she should have specified exceptions for food or used a different method to indicate when to knock. \n\nThe delivery person's job is to follow instructions, but there's also an expectation of common sense. Since the food was delivered late and left unattended, leading to it being cold, the delivery person might not have used discretion. But the author's sign didn't mention food specifically. Her husband's comment that they were asking for it is a bit harsh; she didn't know the sign would affect food deliveries. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she should have considered that food delivery requires a different approach. The sign might be a bit too broad. So the author's intention was to prevent noise, which is understandable, but the execution didn't account for the specific needs of food delivery. Therefore, she might share some responsibility for not making the instructions clear enough. However, the delivery person could have also used their judgment to knock and ensure the food was received properly. \n\nI think the main point here is that the sign was clearly effective, but maybe it's too general. The author's mistake was not tailoring the sign to exclude food deliveries. However, the delivery person's mistake was taking the instructions too literally without considering the context. But since the user is asking if she's in the wrong, the answer would depend on whether the sign's instructions were reasonable. If the sign just said \"Do not Knock\" for all deliveries, including food, then she might be in the wrong for not specifying. However, the sign in the image (which I can't see, but from the description, it's a sign with courier logos that says not to knock) might have been meant for packages, not food. \n\nWait, the user mentioned that the sign with corporate logos worked too well. So maybe the sign was intended to stop only the couriers from knocking, not the food delivery. But the sign didn't differentiate. So the problem is the sign's ambiguity. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction but didn't realize it was for packages. The author might be in the wrong for not making the sign clearer. But she did try to communicate \"Do not knock\" in the cart notes as well. However, the fact that the sign was more effective but caused this issue suggests that maybe she should have considered the implications for food. \n\nIn that case, she might not be entirely in the wrong, but her instructions could have been more specific. The delivery person also should use common sense. So the answer is probably B (No), she's not in the wrong, but it's a bit of a shared issue. But according to the AITA framework, if the delivery person took the instruction to not knock literally, then the fault is on them. However, if the sign was unclear, the author might share some blame. Since she's a new mom and wants quiet, her intention is valid, but the method could be improved. The delivery person should have known that food requires handing over. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
