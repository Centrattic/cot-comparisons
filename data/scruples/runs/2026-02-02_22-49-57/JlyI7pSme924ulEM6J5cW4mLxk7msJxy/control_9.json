I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's dealing with a lot of packages. She's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door despite her clear instructions not to. She put up signs and notes in the delivery options, but they were ignored. Then she found a sign with the courier logos that worked\u2014so well that when they delivered food, they just left it at the door. The food got cold, and now she's upset. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, the problem is that she wanted to avoid knocks, maybe because she's a new mom and doesn't want to be disturbed. So she tried different methods to communicate that. The sign with the logos was effective, but led to unintended consequences. The food delivery person didn't knock and left the meal outside, which was then cold. \n\nShe argues that common sense should have prevailed. But the delivery person might have followed the sign literally, not considering that food needs to be handled differently. However, the sign didn't specify different handling for packages versus food. The user's main issue was knocking, but the delivery person addressed that by not knocking, which is what the sign said. However, the food delivery isn't a package, so maybe the sign's application here was a bit off. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? She tried to communicate her request clearly. The delivery person followed the instructions but didn't use judgment for the different situation. The sign might have been too broad. The user might have assumed that delivery people would understand the context, but the instructions were explicit. So maybe the responsibility is on the delivery person for not adapting. But the user's setup led to the problem. She might be at fault for not considering that food delivery requires a different approach. Alternatively, she's not at fault because she followed proper channels to communicate her requests. \n\nThe husband says they asked for it. But the user's goal was to avoid knocks, not to have food left cold. The delivery person's strict adherence caused the issue. So it's a bit of a gray area. However, the sign was a solution to a problem, and the unintended consequence is on the delivery person for not using common sense. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
