I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" for packages. The delivery people kept knocking, so she got a sign with courier logos that worked, but then when she ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door and it got cold. She's wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had clear instructions not to knock, which were ignored. She then used a more effective sign with courier logos, which worked for packages. But when she ordered dinner, the delivery person followed the same sign and left it at the door, leading to a cold meal. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nSo, the main question is whether her expectations were reasonable. She wanted packages delivered without knocking, which she had communicated multiple times. When the delivery person saw the sign, they followed it, which led to the food being cold. The problem here is the conflict between the sign's purpose (for packages) and the food delivery situation. The sign might be generic, not distinguishing between packages and food. The delivery person didn't realize the sign was only for packages, so they followed it literally.\n\nFrom a common sense perspective, maybe the delivery person should have used judgment. Food delivery typically requires more care, like knocking to ensure someone is there to take it. However, the author might have misunderstood that the sign's instructions were for packages only. So the issue is about communication clarity. If the sign was ambiguous and led to misinterpretation, the author might be partially at fault for not specifying that the no-knocking rule was only for packages, not food. On the other hand, the delivery person should have used common sense, especially since food needs to be handled differently.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. The author took steps to communicate her preferences, but perhaps the method wasn't specific enough. The delivery person might be too literal, not considering the context. However, the author might not be at fault if the sign was the standard one used by the courier, and she followed their instructions. Alternatively, if the sign was ambiguous, then maybe she should have specified. But given that she had issues with packages, maybe the sign was intended for that purpose only. The food delivery is a different service, so the delivery person might not have known. In that case, the author might not be entirely at fault, but there's a communication gap. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer could be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she communicated her preferences, and the issue arose from a misinterpretation of the sign's scope. However, there's a nuance where the sign might not have been clear enough for different types of deliveries. But the core problem is the delivery person not using common sense for food. The author's husband might be right in a way, but the main fault is on the delivery person for not adjusting based on the situation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
