I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has been getting packages and has been telling people not to knock, using signs and notes. The delivery people kept ignoring that and knocking. So she put up a sign with the courier logos that said not to knock. It worked for packages, but then when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it got cold.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the conflicting expectations. The author wanted no knocking for packages, which she communicated clearly through various methods. The delivery people didn't comply, so she took stronger measures with a visual sign. The sign worked for packages, but when it came to food, which is time-sensitive and needs to be handed off, the delivery person followed the same method, leading to a problem.\n\nThe user's husband says they were asking for it, implying that maybe the author's sign was too broad and didn't differentiate between packages and food. The author argues that common sense should prevail, meaning the delivery person should know that food isn't a package and needs to be handled differently.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the sign was too general. The author might not be in the wrong because she had a specific need (not to be disturbed with packages) and communicated it, but perhaps didn't account for different types of deliveries. However, the delivery person also had a responsibility to use judgment. Food delivery typically requires handing over the item, so not knocking in that case is problematic. The sign might have been misinterpreted or applied in a way the author didn't anticipate. \n\nBut considering that the author's intent was to prevent knocking, and the delivery person followed the sign literally, the fault might lie with the communication method. Maybe the sign wasn't clear enough about exceptions, like food deliveries. However, common sense would suggest that food needs to be handed over, so the delivery person should have knocked. Therefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's a gap in communication. The answer here is B (No), because the author's intent was to avoid disturbances for packages, not food, which requires different handling.\n"
