I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on their door. The situation is that the author, a new mom, was getting a lot of packages and had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to prevent disturbances, especially since they have a baby. However, when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, leading to the food being cold. The author is upset because she expected the delivery person to knock despite the signs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had multiple signs and notes in the checkout to prevent knocking. The initial intent was to avoid disturbances for the baby. The sign that worked for packages had pictures of the courier logos, which now caused the food delivery person to leave the food at the door. The result was a cold meal.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the signs were meant for package deliveries, not food. Maybe the delivery person confused the sign's purpose. The author might not have realized that the sign could apply to food deliveries too. However, the delivery person followed the sign's instructions, which was to not knock, leading to the problem. The husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests that the sign's presence caused the issue. \n\nThe key points are: the author's intention was to prevent disturbances, but the sign was applied more broadly than intended. The delivery person followed the sign, which wasn't their fault. The author's expectation might not have been communicated clearly. However, the author also expected the delivery person to use common sense, which is a bit conflicting. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author set up the sign to avoid being disturbed, but in doing so, didn't account for food deliveries needing immediate attention. The delivery person followed the instructions given, so they aren't at fault. The author might be in the wrong because the sign's instructions led to the cold food. However, the alternative is that the delivery person should have used discretion, which the author expects. \n\nBut the signs specifically said not to knock, so the delivery person did as instructed. The author's problem is that the sign was too broad. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not specifying that the sign was for packages only. Alternatively, the delivery person should have knocked despite the sign if they thought the food needed attention. But the scenario says the delivery person left it at the door because of the sign, which was the correct action based on the instructions given. \n\nTherefore, the author's mistake was not clarifying the sign's scope. The delivery person followed the instructions, so the author is in the wrong because their own instructions caused the problem. So answer A.\n"
