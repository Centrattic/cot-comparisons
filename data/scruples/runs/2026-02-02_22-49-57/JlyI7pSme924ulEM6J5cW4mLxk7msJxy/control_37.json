I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for expecting the food deliverer to knock on their door. They were a new mom getting lots of packages. They had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, but those were ignored. So they put up a sign with the courier logos that actually worked. But when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door because of the sign, and it got cold. The husband said they were asking for it, but the person thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, the user's intention was to prevent delivery people from knocking, which they did because maybe they didn't want to be disturbed, especially as a new mom. They tried multiple ways to communicate \"no knock,\" but it didn't work. So they used a more effective sign. However, when it came to a food delivery (which might be time-sensitive), the delivery person followed the sign and left it at the door, leading to a problem. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points: the sign was meant for packages, but maybe the food delivery person didn't realize it was different. The sign might not have specified to knock for food. The delivery person followed the instructions literally. The user expected food to be delivered hot but it was left outside and got cold. \n\nIs the author responsible for not making the sign clear enough? Or is the delivery person responsible for using common sense? The user did have \"Do not knock\" for packages, but food delivery might be different. Maybe the sign should have had exceptions. The user's husband thinks they were asking for it, implying that the sign's effectiveness backfired. \n\nThe user's argument is that common sense should have prevailed. The delivery person could have knocked despite the sign, especially for food. But the sign said not to knock, so maybe the deliverer followed orders. It's a bit of a grey area. The user might be in the wrong for not having a sign that clearly distinguishes between packages and food deliveries. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment. \n\nIn terms of AITA, sometimes it's about the intention versus the outcome. The user wanted to stop being disturbed, which is understandable. However, the outcome of the food being cold might mean they should have clarified the sign. Since they used a sign that had the courier logos, maybe it was applied too broadly. So maybe the user is partially responsible for not being specific. But the delivery person might have overfollowed the instructions. \n\nIn the end, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the user's main intention was to prevent disturbances, and the delivery person should have used common sense for a food delivery. However, if the sign was clear and the delivery person followed it without thinking, maybe the user is a bit at fault for not having a more detailed sign. But I think the key is that food delivery requires knocking, so the delivery person should have known that. Hence, the author isn't in the wrong."
