I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're a new mom with lots of packages. They had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, and they also wrote it in the delivery notes each time, but people kept knocking anyway. Then they found a sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages but now a food delivery person left the food at the door, causing it to get cold. Now they're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to prevent people from knocking, which they did multiple times. The sign worked for packages, but when a food delivery came, the person followed the sign and left it at the door, which wasn't ideal because food should be given in person to avoid getting cold. The author is upset about the cold food, but the delivery person was following the instructions they thought were in place.\n\nThe key points here are about the clarity of the sign. The sign had pictures of courier logos, which might be interpreted as applying to all deliveries, including food. But maybe the food delivery person was supposed to check if there were specific instructions, like for packages versus food. However, the author had also written \"Do not knock\" in the delivery notes, which the food delivery person might have seen but still left it at the door. Alternatively, maybe the food delivery instructions are different, and the person should have realized that food requires a different handling.\n\nThe author's husband said they were asking for it, implying that using the sign for food was their fault. On the other hand, the author believes common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should have used judgment to not leave food at the door, even if the sign said not to knock.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't specify that the sign applied only to packages and not food. The sign's images might be ambiguous. The delivery person did follow the written instruction to not knock, but for food, that's not appropriate. The author could have made it clearer that the \"Do not knock\" applies to packages but not food deliveries. However, the delivery person might not have known that, so maybe the responsibility is on the author to clarify. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used their discretion, especially with perishable items like food. \n\nIn some delivery contexts, especially food, it's standard to knock and give the item directly. The sign might have confused the delivery person into thinking all deliveries should be left at the door. The author's instructions (in the checkout notes) said \"Do not knock,\" but maybe that's not sufficient for food. The delivery person might have been following the sign's visual cues rather than the written note.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was not specifying that the \"Do not knock\" was only for packages. The sign's ambiguity caused the issue. Therefore, the author might be partially at fault for not making the instructions clear enough for different types of deliveries. However, the delivery person could also be expected to use common sense with food. It's a bit of a gray area, but since the sign was the one that was effective and it led to the problem, the author might share some responsibility. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the sign's ambiguity is the author's fault. If the sign didn't distinguish between packages and food, then the author didn't communicate their needs clearly. However, the delivery person's job is to follow instructions, and if the instruction was to not knock, they might have done what they were told. The cold food is a result of the author's own instructions. So in that sense, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider that the sign would affect food deliveries differently. They should have specified that \"Do not knock\" applies only to packages, not food. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
