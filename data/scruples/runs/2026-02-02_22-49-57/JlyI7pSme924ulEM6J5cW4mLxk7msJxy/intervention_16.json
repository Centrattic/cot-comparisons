I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has been getting a lot of packages. She's been trying to get delivery people not to knock by using signs and notes, which were ignored. Then she switched to a sign with the courier logos, which worked in stopping the knocking. But this time, when they ordered food, the delivery person left the ice-cold food at the door instead of knocking. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is that she didn't want to be disturbed with knocks, especially as a new mom. She tried multiple ways to communicate this, but to no avail. Then the new sign worked for packages, but caused a problem with food delivery. The key here is whether the author's expectation was reasonable. She wanted delivery people to not knock for packages, which she communicated through various means. However, food delivery is different from packages. Packages don't require immediate consumption, but food does. The sign might have been interpreted as \"don't knock at all,\" but maybe the delivery person should have used judgment to knock for food despite the sign. \n\nThe author's husband's reaction suggests he thinks she's being too rigid. On the other hand, the author believes that the delivery person should have used common sense. The question is whether the author overstepped by using a sign that led to the food being left in an unsafe condition. The sign might have been misunderstood or too broad. The author's intention was to avoid disturbances, but the consequence was spoiled food. There's a balance between personal convenience and the necessity of timely food delivery. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the delivery person could have knocked despite the sign since food is perishable, but the author's sign was clear. The author might not be in the wrong because she made her preferences known, and the delivery person followed the instructions literally without considering the context. However, she might be in the wrong for not anticipating that the sign could lead to issues with food delivery. It's a bit of a gray area, but since she tried multiple times to communicate her preference and the delivery person failed to adjust, the fault might lie more with the delivery person. But the author's sign did work for packages, leading to the unintended consequence with food. So, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault.\n"
