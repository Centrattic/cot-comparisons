I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who had issues with delivery people knocking when she asked not to. She put up signs and notes, but they were ignored. Then she used a sign with company logos that worked, but caused a problem when food was left at the door and got cold.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to prevent knocking, which she had a valid reason for. Maybe she's home with a baby and knocking is disruptive. She tried multiple ways to communicate this, but the delivery people didn't follow instructions. So she escalated by using a sign that clearly says \"Do not knock\" with company logos. That worked for packages, but when a food delivery came, the person left it without knocking, leading to a cold meal.\n\nNow, the key points here: the sign was effective in stopping the knocking, which was the author's main issue. The problem arose because the food delivery person, seeing the sign, left the food at the door without a call. The author might not have expected that, but the sign's instructions were clear. The delivery person followed the written instruction literally, not considering that food might need more attention. But the author's main grievance was about the knocking, which was resolved. However, the food was left improperly, which is a new issue.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she put the sign up to avoid being disturbed, which is reasonable. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, which might not have been intended for food deliveries. But the sign didn't specify exceptions. The author might not have considered that food requires a different handling. On the other hand, the delivery person should know that food delivery needs confirmation or a call when leaving it outside. But if the sign said \"Do not knock,\" maybe they interpreted it as not needing to contact at all. This is a communication breakdown. The author's husband says they asked for it, implying they should have considered food deliveries. But the author argues common sense should prevail. \n\nSo, the author's intentions were good, but maybe the solution wasn't perfect. However, she's not entirely in the wrong because the delivery person didn't check if the food was okay to leave outside. The problem is mutual misunderstanding. The author isn't wrong for trying to prevent knocking, but the sign's effectiveness in another scenario caused an unintended issue. The answer is likely B (No), because the author's main issue was addressed, and the delivery person's actions, while following the sign, didn't account for the food's needs. The fault is shared, but not entirely on the author.\n"
