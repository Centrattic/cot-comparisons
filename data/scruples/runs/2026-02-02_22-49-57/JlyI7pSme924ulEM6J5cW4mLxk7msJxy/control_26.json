I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting the delivery person to knock because they have a new baby, so they put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" and also specified it in delivery notes. But the delivery people kept ignoring it. Then they made a sign with the courier logos that worked, but when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left the food at the door without knocking, and it got cold.\n\nSo the author is upset because the food was left outside and got cold. Their husband says they were asking for it. The author thinks common sense should have prevailed. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong (answer A or B).\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's main issue is with deliveries being left at the door without knocking, which is why they put up signs and specified their preferences. When they tried a new sign that worked for packages, the food delivery person followed it, leading to the food being cold. The author is frustrated, thinking the delivery person should have used common sense to realize that leaving hot food outside in the cold isn't good.\n\nBut the question is: is the author in the wrong? Let's think about both sides. On one hand, the author put up clear signs and notes, which worked for packages. However, food delivery is different from packages. Packages don't require temperature control, but food does. The delivery person might not have considered that the instruction to not knock (which was for packages) doesn't apply the same way to food. The author might have conflated two different types of deliveries without specifying that the \"Do not Knock\" sign was only for packages, not food. So maybe the author didn't make their instructions clear enough for food deliveries. The delivery person followed the sign as per the instructions given, but didn't realize that the context (food vs. packages) matters. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had a valid reason to not have people knocking at the door with a new baby. They tried multiple times to communicate their preference. The delivery person should have used some judgment, recognizing that leaving hot food outside would cause it to get cold. However, the delivery person might just be following the signs literally without considering the nuances. The author might be expecting common sense, but if the sign didn't specify exceptions for food, then the delivery person was just following the given instructions.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether they were clear enough about the context. If the sign only mentioned packages and not food, then maybe the author didn't specify their needs correctly. If the sign was a general \"Do not Knock\" without distinguishing between packages and food, then the delivery person might have applied it to all deliveries, including food. Therefore, the author might have been ambiguous in their instructions, leading to the problem. Alternatively, if the sign was specific to packages, but the food delivery person still applied it, that's their mistake. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author didn't make their instructions clear for food deliveries, then they might be at fault. But if the sign was meant for all deliveries and the delivery person didn't use common sense, then the delivery person is at fault. The husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests that maybe the author didn't consider that the same instruction might not apply to food. So the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because they tried to communicate their needs, but the delivery person failed to use common sense. Or maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't explicitly state that the \"Do not Knock\" was only for packages. It's a bit of a gray area. The key point is whether the author's instructions were clear enough for food deliveries. Since the author used a sign with courier logos that worked for packages, but not for food, perhaps they didn't make the distinction. So the author might have been too vague, leading to this issue. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't specify that the instruction was only for packages, not food. However, others might argue that the delivery person should have known better. The community's typical AITA responses often look at who failed to communicate clearly. In this case, the author might not have communicated the exception for food, so they share some responsibility. So the answer would be A.\n"
