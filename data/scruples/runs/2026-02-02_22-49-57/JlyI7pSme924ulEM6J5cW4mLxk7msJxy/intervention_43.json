I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door despite her clear instructions not to. She put up signs and wrote notes, but it didn't work. Then she used a more prominent sign with logos, which worked for packages but backfired when a food delivery person left a cold meal at the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. As a new mom, she might be stressed and dealing with the baby, making it inconvenient to answer the door. Her efforts to communicate \"Don't knock\" were persistent: handwritten signs, notes on packages, and even using a sign with corporate logos. The fact that the food delivery person followed the sign's instruction and left the meal outside is what caused the problem. The author feels frustrated that the delivery person didn't use common sense to check if the meal would be okay left outside, especially since food needs to be warm.\n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person might have been following the explicit instruction given by the sign, which said not to knock. Since the sign didn't mention anything about the method of delivery, they might not have realized that leaving a cold meal was an issue. Also, the sign was created to prevent knocking for packages, not necessarily for food deliveries. The delivery person might not have known that this sign applied to food orders too, especially since the sign's focus was on packages.\n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests that maybe the solution wasn't thought through. The key here is whether the author's instructions were clear enough for different types of deliveries. The sign might have been effective in stopping the knocking for packages but didn't account for varying delivery needs, like food which requires timely and temperature-controlled handling.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If she didn't specify that the sign applied to food deliveries, the delivery person might not have known to handle it differently. However, expecting a delivery person to use common sense in such situations is reasonable. The author's intention was to avoid the hassle of someone knocking, but she might not have considered the implications for different types of packages. There's a balance between clear communication and flexibility. The sign was too broad, leading to an unintended consequence.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because she was trying to manage her situation as a new mom. However, she could have been more specific about the type of deliveries the instructions applied to. Since the sign didn't differentiate between packages and food, the delivery person followed the given instruction literally. The responsibility might be shared, but the main issue is the ambiguity in the instructions. Therefore, the answer is B for No.\n"
