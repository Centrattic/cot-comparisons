I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a new mom who gets a lot of packages. She put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" because she didn't want people knocking, maybe to avoid disturbing her baby or causing noise. But the delivery people kept knocking despite her notes. Then she put up a new sign with company logos, and it worked for packages\u2014no knocking. But then when they ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock, left it at the door, and it was late and cold. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the sign's purpose and its unintended consequences. The original intent was to prevent knocking for packages, which is understandable, especially for a new mom needing quiet. But the sign might have been interpreted too broadly, including food deliveries. The delivery person followed the sign literally, leading to the food being left unattended and getting cold. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, she tried to communicate her preference clearly for packages, but maybe the sign was too generic and didn't differentiate between package deliveries and food. Food delivery might require different handling, like not leaving it outside in the cold, whereas packages are okay. The problem is that the sign didn't specify that food should be handled differently. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" might be valid if the sign was too broad. The author might have assumed that common sense would prevail, but in reality, the delivery person just followed the written instructions without considering the context. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's main concern was to avoid disturbances, which is reasonable. She might not have anticipated that food delivery would be affected. The sign's effectiveness for packages suggests it was clear, but maybe she should have made a separate note for food. \n\nSo, the answer could be that she's not entirely at fault, but there's a misunderstanding in how the sign was applied. However, since the sign led to a negative outcome for the food order, she might share some responsibility for not clarifying the exception. But the main issue is the sign's ambiguity. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often consider both intent and outcome. The intent was good (avoiding noise), but the outcome was a cold meal. Since the sign was meant for packages and not food, maybe the author didn't account for that, but it's not entirely her fault. The delivery person also should have used common sense, but the sign was clear. \n\nI think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. The sign worked as intended for packages, and the food situation was an oversight. The delivery person should have used judgment, but the sign's presence might have led them to follow it too literally. So the author isn't entirely at fault.\n"
