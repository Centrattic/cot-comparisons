I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put up a sign saying \"Do not Knock\" to avoid disturbing her baby during deliveries, but when she used a sign with courier logos, the food delivery person didn't knock and left the ice cold food at the door.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author had previous issues with delivery people knocking, so she tried different signs. The first signs were ignored, but the one with corporate logos worked. However, the food was left unattended, leading to it getting cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author feels common sense should have been applied.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault. The sign was effective in preventing the knock, but the delivery person didn't follow up by calling or texting. The author's intent was to stop knocking, not to prevent the delivery person from ensuring the food was properly received. The problem is that the delivery person might not have known how to handle the situation when the customer wasn't answering the door. \n\nIn some delivery scenarios, especially with food, it's important for the delivery person to confirm that the customer is present to avoid issues like cold food. The author's sign might have communicated \"no knock,\" but maybe didn't specify other ways to contact her. So, maybe the delivery person did follow the instructions but didn't realize they needed to use another method. Alternatively, the sign might have been too ambiguous, leading the delivery person to just leave it and not check if the customer was home.\n\nThe author expects that the delivery person would use common sense, like calling or texting if they can't knock. However, the sign didn't include those instructions. So, perhaps the author is being a bit unreasonable by not providing alternative communication methods. On the other hand, the delivery person's job is to deliver the food, and if the customer's instructions are to not knock, they might not know what to do next. \n\nThe husband's comment suggests that using a sign that stops the delivery person from knocking might lead to situations where the customer isn't present. The author's husband is right in a way that if the customer wasn't there, the food would be left, but the author's intention was to avoid the knock, not to have the delivery person leave it without confirmation. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't consider that the delivery person needs a way to communicate if the customer isn't at home. The sign should have included alternative instructions, like using a phone call or text. Without that, the delivery person followed the instruction to not knock but didn't know to contact her another way. \n\nBut then again, the delivery person should know the standard procedures for handling such situations. Maybe the author's sign was too strict and didn't account for the need to confirm the customer's presence. The food being left cold could be a result of the delivery person not following up properly. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a mixed situation. The author's intent was good, but the execution might have been flawed. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because she didn't provide clear alternative instructions, leading to the problem. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) since she was trying to protect her baby and the delivery person should have handled it better. \n\nBut most delivery services, especially for food, usually have a way to check if the customer is present. If the customer isn't there and the food is time-sensitive, they might not leave it. However, in this case, the delivery person did leave it but didn't notify the customer. The author's sign might have inadvertently caused that by not allowing any communication. So maybe the author is at fault for not considering that the delivery person needs to communicate in another way if the customer is not at home. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
