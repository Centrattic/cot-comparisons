I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who has a lot of packages delivered. She's been using signs that say \"Do not Knock\" to avoid the doorbell waking her baby. But the delivery people kept knocking anyway. So she made a new sign with the corporate logos to get the attention of the food delivery person, which worked in the sense that they left the package without knocking. But the problem is, the food was left outside and got cold.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are her intent to protect her baby from being disturbed by delivery knocks and her use of the sign to communicate that. However, when it came to a food delivery that required immediate attention to stay warm, the same sign caused the delivery person to leave it outside, leading to a cold meal. \n\nShe did try multiple times to specify \"Do not knock\" in delivery notes, but they were ignored. So she escalated by using a more visible sign. The delivery person followed the instruction literally, but not in the way she intended. The husband thinks they're asking for trouble by not allowing knocking for food. The user argues common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should have realized that food needs to be kept warm and thus shouldn't have left it outside.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, she's trying to protect her baby and followed the company's note sections, but the delivery people didn't comply. Her solution worked for packages but failed for food. The delivery person might not have considered that food delivery has different needs. However, she should have realized that a sign saying not to knock might lead to unintended consequences for perishable items. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? The answer depends on whether her sign's instructions were too broad. If the sign didn't differentiate between packages and food, then maybe she didn't consider that. Alternatively, maybe the delivery person should have used judgment. But since she's the one who created the sign, perhaps she's responsible for not clarifying that it's only for packages, not food. So, maybe she's at least partially at fault for not making the distinction clear. But since she tried multiple times to communicate \"do not knock\" and the delivery people ignored it, her solution was a reasonable attempt to enforce her request, even if it backfired. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because her primary concern was her baby's well-being, and she followed the correct procedures. The delivery person's literal adherence to the sign led to an unintended consequence, but the fault isn't entirely hers. However, maybe she should have considered the food aspect. Hmm. It's a bit of a grey area. But given the context, the user is trying to protect her child and followed the right steps, so the answer might lean towards B. The delivery person should have used common sense, as the user mentioned. So B.\n"
