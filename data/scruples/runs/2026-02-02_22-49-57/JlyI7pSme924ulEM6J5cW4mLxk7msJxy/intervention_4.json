I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a new mom, had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for package deliveries because they were causing issues, probably disturbing her or the baby. The delivery people kept knocking despite the instructions. Then she put up a sign with company logos, and it worked\u2014delivery people left packages without knocking. But when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door in the cold, and it was late. The author is wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points are: She tried multiple times to communicate not to knock, and the food delivery person followed the same instructions but didn't realize the food needed to be kept warm. The husband says they asked for it, but she thinks common sense should prevail.\n\nHmm. Is the author in the wrong? Well, she clearly communicated her preference not to be knocked on, which the delivery people followed. The problem here is that the sign might have been too broad. Food deliveries are different from packages because they need to be handled differently, like keeping hot food hot. The author didn't specify a different instruction for food, just a general \"Do not knock.\" So maybe she didn't consider that some deliveries require immediate attention. But on the other hand, she had a valid reason not to be disturbed, especially as a new mom. The delivery person followed the instructions literally but didn't use common sense, which the author is pointing out. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. She didn't explicitly say \"leave food at the door,\" so the delivery person might not have known. However, the sign with company logos might have been too general. Maybe she should have made separate instructions for food. But she's a new mom dealing with a lot, and maybe the delivery person should have checked if the package was food and handled it accordingly. \n\nIt's a tricky situation. The author's intention was to prevent disturbances, which is understandable. The delivery person followed the instructions but didn't take into account the food's temperature. So maybe she's not in the wrong because she was following through on her previous instructions. Alternatively, the delivery person might have been at fault for not using common sense. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer could be no because she communicated her preferences and the delivery person didn't adapt. So answer B.\n"
