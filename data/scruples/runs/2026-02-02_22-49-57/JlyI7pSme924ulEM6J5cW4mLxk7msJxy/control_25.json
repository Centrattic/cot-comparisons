I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is wrong here. So the situation is that she's a new mom with lots of packages. She had signs saying \"Do not knock\" because she didn't want delivery people to knock and disturb her, maybe because she's busy with the baby. But the delivery people kept knocking anyway. Then she put up a more visible sign with company logos, and that worked\u2014until she ordered dinner and the delivery person left it at the door. The food was cold by the time she noticed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wanted to avoid noise, so she put up signs. She tried different methods, and they worked for packages. But when it came to a food delivery, which is different from a package, maybe the delivery person didn't realize the food needed to be handled differently. The sign didn't specify that food should be knocked on the door. So maybe the delivery person followed the sign's instruction literally, not considering the perishable nature of food.\n\nThe author expected the delivery person to use common sense and not just follow the sign blindly. But the delivery person might have been trained to follow instructions as written. The sign didn't mention food, so they treated it like a regular package. The husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests he thinks the sign was a bit too strict. But the author believes that common sense should override the written instruction, especially when the food's temperature matters.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She had a valid reason for the sign, but maybe she should have specified that food deliveries are an exception. The delivery person followed the rules as given, which the author provided. However, the problem is that food is different from packages. The author might be responsible for not making her instructions clear enough for different types of deliveries. Alternatively, the delivery person should have known that food needs to be handed directly to the recipient. \n\nI think the key here is whether the delivery person is expected to use judgment. If the instructions are clear and specific, they should follow them. But if they're supposed to adapt based on the situation (like food vs. packages), maybe the author didn't communicate that well. However, the sign didn't mention food, so the delivery person did what was instructed. The author's expectation that common sense applies even when not stated might be a bit much. So maybe the author is partly at fault for not specifying exceptions, but the delivery person is also responsible for handling food properly. But since the system relies on the recipient's instructions, the delivery person might not be wrong. The author's sign was clear, but she might not have considered the different needs of food. So perhaps the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because her instructions were too broad and didn't account for perishable items.\n"
