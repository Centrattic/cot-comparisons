I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has been putting up signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" for package deliveries. She did this because she didn't want the delivery people to knock, maybe to avoid disturbing her baby or for privacy. The signs worked for packages but then she ordered dinner, and the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, resulting in the food being cold. She's upset, and her husband says they were asking for it. She's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. As a new mom, she might have legitimate reasons not to want people knocking, like the baby's nap time or avoiding noise. She took steps to communicate her preference through signs and notes, which worked for packages. But when it came to food delivery, the same approach was used, leading to an issue because food delivery typically requires a different handling\u2014like someone being home to receive it. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. She made her wishes clear for packages, but food delivery services might have different protocols. The delivery person following the \"Do not knock\" instruction strictly might have left the food outside, which isn't ideal when the recipient isn't home to take it immediately. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she didn't specify that the sign was for packages only. The sign included different logos, but maybe it wasn't clear which services were covered. If the sign was a general instruction for all deliveries, then she might have a point in not wanting to be disturbed. However, food delivery usually requires someone to be present to take the food hot. By not making an exception for food, she might have created a problem for herself. \n\nHer husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests that using the same sign for food deliveries was a mistake. The author argues common sense should prevail, but maybe she didn't consider that food delivery isn't the same as packages. The delivery person followed the instructions literally, which worked for packages but not for food. \n\nSo, the author's mistake could be not differentiating between package delivery and food delivery. She might have expected the delivery person to use judgment, but the sign was a clear instruction. Alternatively, the delivery person should have realized that food needs to be handed over immediately. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, she set the instruction, and the delivery person followed it. But maybe she should have realized that food deliveries are different and adjusted her instructions accordingly. However, the husband's comment could be a bit harsh. It's possible that the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but she could have been more specific with her instructions. \n\nLooking at the AITA context, usually, if someone's instructions are clear but lead to an unintended consequence, the onus is on them. So maybe she's not the asshole, but she's responsible for not considering the different types of deliveries. But the answer options are A for yes (she's wrong) and B for no. \n\nGiven that she made the instructions and the delivery person followed them, but the outcome was negative because of not differentiating service types, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, the main issue is that she expected the delivery person to not knock, which caused the food to be left outside. Since she didn't specify that the sign only applied to package deliveries, she might be at fault for not considering the different needs of food delivery. So the answer might be A. But if the delivery person should have used common sense, then B.\n"
