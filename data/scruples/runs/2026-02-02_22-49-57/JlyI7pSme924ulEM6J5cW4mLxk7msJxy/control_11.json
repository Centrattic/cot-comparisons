I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock on the door. The author is a new mom who gets many packages and has been trying to prevent deliveries from being left at the door. They put up signs and notes saying \"Do not knock,\" but it didn't work. Then they used a sign with corporate logos, which worked for packages but caused an issue with a food delivery that was left outside and got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intent. They wanted to ensure packages are delivered properly, which makes sense, especially for a new mom who might be busy. However, the sign they used was specifically for packages, but the food delivery person also followed it, leading to a problem. The key point is whether the sign was intended to apply to all deliveries, including food, or just packages. The author might not have considered that the sign could be interpreted more broadly, but they did mention in their post that the sign was for the corporate courier logos, implying it's for package deliveries. \n\nNext, the delivery person's action: they left the food at the door because the sign said not to knock. The food was supposed to be delivered to the door, but it got cold. The husband thinks they \"asked for it,\" but the author argues that common sense should have prevailed. The question is whether the author is wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock, even if they had the sign up.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the author is within their right to request that delivery people not knock, especially if they have valid reasons like being a new mom. However, when using a sign that's associated with package delivery (like the corporate logos mentioned), it's possible that the sign was meant for packages, not food. Food deliveries might be expected to be left at the door if no one is there, regardless of any signs. The delivery person might not have known the sign was only for packages, leading to a misunderstanding.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if the sign was ambiguous and the delivery person reasonably followed it, leading to the cold food. However, if the sign was intended for packages and the delivery person misinterpreted it for food, then the responsibility isn't entirely on the author. The husband's comment that they \"asked for it\" might be valid if the sign was a direct instruction, but the author's intention was for packages, not food deliveries. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because the sign was intended for packages, but there's a gray area. The delivery person should have used some common sense, but the sign's ambiguity could be an issue. Since the author took steps to communicate their preference and the delivery person misinterpreted the sign, it's a shared misunderstanding. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the context, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the sign was for packages, and the delivery person should have exercised judgment for a food delivery.\n"
