I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a new mom who gets a lot of packages. They've been using signs saying \"Do not Knock\" but the delivery people keep knocking anyway. So they made a sign with the courier logos that says not to knock, and that worked for packages. But then when they ordered dinner, the delivery person saw the sign, left the food at the door without knocking, and it got cold. The author is upset because they thought the food should have been brought inside. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the sign and how it was interpreted. The sign was intended for packages, not food delivery. The author probably didn't consider that food might be delivered differently. The delivery person followed the sign literally, which worked for packages but not for food. The author is upset because the food was left outside and got cold, which makes sense because food needs to be kept warm. \n\nThe author's intention was to prevent noise for the baby, which is a valid concern for a new mom. But maybe the sign wasn't specific enough. The delivery person didn't knock for the package before, but the food delivery required a different approach. The problem is that the sign was generalized to all deliveries, but food delivery is time-sensitive and needs to be handled differently. \n\nThe author might have been in a hurry to get the food in, but the sign's instructions were followed as written. However, the situation wasn't clearly communicated. The author didn't specify that food should be brought inside, only that packages shouldn't be knocked on the door. So the delivery person might not have known the difference. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because their intention was clear for packages, and they had tried multiple times to communicate that. But maybe they should have made a distinction between packages and food deliveries. On the other hand, the delivery person should have used some judgment here, considering that food needs to be kept warm. Common sense might dictate that food shouldn't be left outside, even if the sign says not to knock. \n\nSo, the author's husband says they were asking for it, which makes me think he's on the side that they are partly to blame. But the author argues that common sense should have prevailed. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because their intention was valid, and the delivery person should have used judgment for the food. The sign was ambiguous in this context, and the delivery person's strict adherence without considering the food's condition might be the issue here. The author tried multiple times to communicate the package instructions, but food delivery is a different scenario. So the author isn't entirely at fault.\n"
