I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has been getting packages delivered and has been using various signs and notes to indicate not to knock. The food delivery person saw the sign with logos, left the food at the door without knocking, resulting in it being ice cold. The husband thinks they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to prevent people from knocking, which they did through multiple methods. The sign worked for packages, but the food delivery person didn't knock, leading to the food being cold. The key points here are whether the author's instructions were clear enough, if the delivery person should have overridden them for common sense, and if the author is responsible for the outcome.\n\nThe author provided explicit instructions in multiple places, so the delivery person did follow the sign. However, the sign was specific to the corporate courier mentioned, and the food delivery person might be from a different service. The sign with logos might have caused confusion, leading the delivery person to follow it even though it wasn't intended for food. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's intention was to avoid knocking, which they did successfully. The unintended consequence was the food being left out. However, the delivery person should have used judgment\u2014maybe knocking is necessary for food to ensure it's received promptly. But the instructions were clear, so the delivery person followed them strictly. The author might not be in the wrong because the instructions were followed, but there's a gray area regarding common sense in food deliveries versus packages.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the instructions were followed as given, even if the outcome was unintended.\n"
