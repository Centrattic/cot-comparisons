I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a new mom who has been dealing with delivery people knocking on her door despite her multiple attempts to specify \"Do not knock.\" She even put up signs and used the delivery notes, but they were ignored. Then she found a more effective sign with the company logos, which worked in stopping the knocking but led to a food delivery being left outside in the cold.\n\nSo the main points here are: the author tried various methods to communicate her preference not to be knocked on, the sign worked but caused a problem with the food delivery. The food delivery person left the ice-cold food at the door. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to prevent knocking, which she had a legitimate reason for. Maybe she's a new mom with a baby, so knocking might be disruptive. She tried multiple times to communicate this. The delivery person, however, followed the sign literally, leading to the food being left outside. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key factors here are communication and common sense. The sign was effective in stopping the knocking, but the delivery person might have misinterpreted it or followed it too literally. The author's instruction was clear, but the consequence was unintended. \n\nWas the author wrong in expecting the delivery person to use common sense? Maybe not. It's reasonable to expect that a food delivery should be brought to the door, especially when the sign was about packages versus food. The sign might have confused the delivery person, treating food like a package. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sign was too broad or not specific enough. The author might have overgeneralized her instructions, leading to the mishap. However, given that she was a new mom dealing with frequent deliveries, her frustration is understandable. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the delivery person had a duty to ensure the food was delivered properly. Even if the sign said not to knock, they should still bring the food to the door as per standard practice for food delivery. The author's sign might have been misinterpreted, but the delivery person should have used judgment. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author tried to communicate her needs but the outcome was a misunderstanding. The delivery person's action was perhaps too literal, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting up the sign based on her previous experiences. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
