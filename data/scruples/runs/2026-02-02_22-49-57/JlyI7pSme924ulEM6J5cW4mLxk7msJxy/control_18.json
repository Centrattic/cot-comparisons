I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole in this situation. The context is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages. She had multiple instances where delivery people ignored her instructions. Then she used a sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages but when they ordered dinner, the delivery person didn't knock and left it at the door in the cold. The food was cold when they found it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is wrong. So, the key points here are her repeated requests not to knock, the ineffective communication leading her to use a more visible sign, and the consequence of that sign working too well with the dinner delivery.\n\nHer intention was to prevent the delivery people from knocking, maybe because she's a new mom and doesn't want the noise or to be disturbed. She tried multiple times to communicate this with notes, but they were ignored. Then she used a sign with the courier logos to make her request clear. It worked for packages, but when a food delivery (not a package) came, the person followed the sign and left it outside, leading to a cold meal.\n\nIs she at fault? Well, maybe she made a mistake in using the same sign for different types of deliveries. Food delivery might require a different handling than packages. Packages can be left at the door, but food is time-sensitive and needs to be handed over to ensure it's warm. The sign might have been intended for packages, but she didn't specify that. The delivery person might not have made the distinction between a package and a food order. Also, maybe she should have considered that food delivery requires a different approach. Alternatively, the delivery person should have checked if the recipient wanted the food handed over even if the sign was there. However, the delivery person followed the instructions given, which were to not knock. But in this case, not knocking led to a worse outcome. So, perhaps the author didn't consider that food delivery is different and her sign might have conflicting implications. Therefore, the husband's comment that they were asking for it might have some validity here. But the author's reasoning is that common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should have used judgment. But maybe the sign was too generic and didn't account for different delivery types. So, she might be partially at fault for not clarifying. But then again, the delivery person could have used common sense as well. The question is whether her sign was unreasonable. The sign was effective for packages, but food is different. Maybe she should have made a separate note for food orders. Alternatively, the delivery person should have knocked to ensure the food was received properly. It's a bit of a gray area. But in terms of right and wrong, maybe she's not entirely wrong because she was trying to communicate her needs, but perhaps she didn't specify enough. However, the delivery person also didn't use judgment. So the answer might depend on whose responsibility it is. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). From the description, the author had a legitimate reason to avoid being knocked on, but perhaps the sign's application was too broad. So maybe she's not in the wrong entirely. The answer might be B.\n"
