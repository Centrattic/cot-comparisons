I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a new mom with lots of packages. They tried multiple times to tell delivery people not to knock, using notes on the door and in delivery options, but it didn't work. Then they got a sign with company logos that worked for packages but caused a problem with food delivery. The food was left at the door, got cold, and now they're upset. The husband says they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author overstepped by using a sign that might mislead food deliverers. The sign is for packages, not food. Food deliveries typically require knocking because the food needs to be received promptly to stay warm. The author tried to communicate \"no knock\" for packages but maybe didn't specify that food deliveries should be an exception. The deliverer followed the sign's instruction literally, leading to a cold meal.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they had a valid reason (not wanting to be disturbed as a new mom) and tried to address the problem. However, the solution they chose might not have considered different delivery types. The sign's effectiveness for packages worked too well, but it didn't account for the different handling needs of food. So maybe the author didn't intend for food to be left, but the sign's instructions were too broad. They could have added a note specifying that food should still be knocked on. But without that, the deliverer followed the given instructions. The author might not be entirely at fault, but they could have been more specific. However, the deliverer also should use some judgment, as leaving hot food outside isn't standard practice. But since the sign was clear, maybe the deliverer is responsible. The husband's point is valid too. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the author isn't in the wrong because their intention was reasonable, but maybe they could have been clearer. So the answer would be B.\n"
