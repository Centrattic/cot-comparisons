I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who's had a lot of package deliveries. She's been putting up signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" to avoid the noise, especially with a baby. But the delivery people kept knocking anyway. So she made a new sign with the courier logos that worked for packages, but when she used it for food delivery, the person left the food at the door instead of bringing it in, and it got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's intention was to prevent knocking, which she had a valid reason for\u2014being a new mom needing quiet. She tried multiple ways to communicate this, but it didn't work until the new sign. The problem came when the sign was used for food delivery. The delivery person interpreted the sign as a no-knock instruction, so they didn't come in, even though food delivery usually requires handing it over to avoid it getting cold. \n\nIs she at fault? Well, she wanted to avoid knocking, but food is different from packages. Packages can be left at the door, but food needs to be handed over. Maybe she should have considered that the sign might apply differently to food deliveries. But she didn't have a way to specify that the sign was only for packages. So maybe she didn't anticipate how the sign would be used in other contexts. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person should have used common sense. Even if the sign said not to knock, the purpose of food delivery is to hand it over to prevent it from getting cold. So maybe the delivery person is at fault for not using judgment. The author's husband says they were asking for it, but she argues that common sense should have prevailed. \n\nThe key points are intent vs. outcome. The author's intent was reasonable\u2014to avoid noise. Her actions were a response to prior issues. However, the outcome was unintended. She might not be in the wrong because the sign worked as intended for packages but didn't account for food. The delivery person should have recognized the difference between a package and food delivery. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong. The delivery person misapplied the sign's instructions without using common sense. The author's actions were a reasonable effort to address her specific need, even if it led to an unintended consequence in this case.\n"
