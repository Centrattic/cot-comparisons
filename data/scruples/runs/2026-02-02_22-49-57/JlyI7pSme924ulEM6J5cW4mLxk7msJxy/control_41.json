I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is the asshole for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The person is a new mom who's been getting many packages. She had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" which were ignored by package deliverers. Then she made a new sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages but failed for a food delivery, leading to a late and cold meal.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the intent behind the sign and the outcome. The sign was created to prevent package deliverers from knocking, which she found annoying. But when a food delivery person saw the same sign and didn't knock, the food got left at the door and was cold. She's upset about the food being late and cold, but her husband says they were asking for it. She thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The sign was meant for package deliverers, not food delivery. Maybe the food deliverer misread the sign's purpose. The problem is that the sign's wording or design wasn't clear enough to distinguish between package and food deliveries. She might have not considered that different services (package vs. food) have different delivery protocols. Food delivery usually requires a knock or call to ensure the food is handed over hot, which is part of their service. The package deliverers were ignoring her \"Do not Knock\" notes, so she made a more noticeable sign, but it caught the food deliverer's attention as well. The food deliverer followed the sign's instruction, leading to the cold meal. \n\nSo, the author's intention was to avoid disturbances from package deliveries, but the sign's design was too broad. The food deliverer might not have known it was specific to packages. She didn't specify that the sign was only for packages, so the deliverer might have assumed it applied to all deliveries. Therefore, the author might be at fault because she didn't make the sign specific enough, leading to unintended consequences. However, some might argue that she's not at fault because the deliverer should have recognized the difference between a food delivery and a package. But given that the sign was about not knocking and didn't mention food, it's possible the deliverer followed the instruction without realizing the food's condition. The husband's comment suggests that the sign's effects were predictable, which adds to the consideration. The author might have been negligent in not specifying the sign's scope, making her the asshole.\n"
