I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a new mom who had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to avoid disturbing her baby when packages are delivered. She had these signs both as handwritten and through delivery notes, but they were ignored. Then she used a sign with corporate logos that worked for packages, but when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it on the door, which got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The mom's intention was to protect her baby from loud knocks, so she took measures to prevent that. The problem is that when the measure worked for packages, it also applied to food delivery, leading to the food being left outside and getting cold. She argues that common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should have realized that food needs to be delivered in a timely way and not just follow the sign literally.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To decide, I need to analyze if her expectations were unreasonable.\n\nOn one hand, she had clear instructions to not knock, which she provided through signs and notes. The delivery person followed those instructions as given, leading to an unintended consequence. The sign was meant for packages, not food, but the delivery person didn't differentiate. The mom might not have considered that food delivery might require a different approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the sign's effectiveness in stopping loud knocks is understandable for a new mom. However, expecting the delivery person to use their judgment to distinguish between a package and a time-sensitive food order might be reasonable. The delivery person could have knocked quietly or left a note instead of just leaving the food outside, especially when it's a regular customer. The mom's husband says they were asking for it, implying that the sign's instructions were too rigid.\n\nBut the sign was specific to packages, not food. The mom may not have intended it to apply to food deliveries. The delivery person might not have realized there's a difference. However, the delivery person's job includes ensuring the food is delivered properly, so maybe they should have used their discretion. The cold food is a problem, but maybe the mom should have communicated differently for food orders, like specifying in the delivery notes for food deliveries to knock or contact her.\n\nIn the end, the mom's primary concern is valid, but the method might have been too broad. The delivery person followed the instructions literally but didn't use common sense. However, the mom could have adjusted her signs or notes to clarify that they apply only to packages, not food. Since the sign included corporate logos, maybe the delivery person generalized it to all deliveries. The mom might not be in the wrong because her intent was to protect her baby, but she could have handled it differently. The delivery person's failure to adapt is on them. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
