I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're a new mom with a lot of packages. They had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to avoid the noise, especially since they have a baby. They tried various ways to communicate this, like notes on the sign and in delivery instructions, but people kept knocking. Then they found a sign with the courier logos that worked, but now the food delivery person left the meal at the door and it got cold.\n\nHmm. The key points are about communication and expectations. The author wanted to prevent knocking, so the sign was effective. But when applied to food delivery, the result was that the food wasn't delivered properly. The question is whether the author is at fault for expecting the delivery person to not knock, even for food.\n\nThe author's intention was to reduce noise for their baby, which is understandable. They tried multiple ways to make their wishes known. The sign worked for packages, but maybe food delivery is different. Food deliveries usually require more immediate attention to keep the food warm. The sign might have been too generic, applying to all deliveries, not just packages. The delivery person might have followed the sign's instruction to not knock, but then couldn't get in, so left it at the door, leading to a cold meal.\n\nIs the author responsible for not considering that food delivery might need a different approach? Maybe they should have specified that the \"do not knock\" rule applies to packages only. Alternatively, maybe the delivery person should have used common sense and tried another method to get in, like calling or leaving a note. But the author's husband says they were \"asking for it,\" implying that the sign caused the problem. \n\nSo, the author's intention was good, but perhaps the implementation wasn't specific enough. They might have failed to distinguish between package deliveries and food, which have different requirements. Therefore, they might share some responsibility. However, the delivery person also had a duty to ensure the food was delivered properly, so maybe both sides have some fault. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer is probably B (No), because the author was trying to communicate their needs and the issue might be on the delivery person's side for not handling it appropriately. However, there's a counterpoint that the author's sign was too broad. It's a bit of a toss-up. But given that the sign specifically had the courier logos, maybe it was intended for all deliveries, including food. The author might not be in the wrong for expecting the sign to be followed, even if it led to an unintended consequence. So the answer could be B.\n"
