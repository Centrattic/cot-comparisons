I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who's dealing with a lot of package deliveries. She kept getting knocked on the door despite her instructions saying \"Do not knock,\" so she put up a sign with pictures of the courier logos that said not to knock. That worked for packages, but when they ordered food delivery using the same sign, the delivery person didn't knock and left it at the door, which was ice cold when they got home.\n\nSo the question is, is she the asshole for expecting the food deliverer to knock? Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, she's a new mom, so maybe she's stressed and dealing with a lot. She had clear instructions for packages not to knock, which she repeated in various ways\u2014handwritten signs and checkout notes. The problem came when the food delivery person followed the same sign but didn't knock, leading to the food being cold.\n\nNow, food delivery is different from packages. Packages can be left at the door, but food is time-sensitive. The sign probably wasn't specific enough to differentiate between packages and food. The delivery person might have assumed the same rule applied, not realizing that food needs to be handed over promptly. \n\nShe did mention that the sign worked \"too well,\" leading to the late delivery. So maybe the sign's instructions were too broad. Her husband thinks they asked for it, which suggests that maybe the sign's message was too absolute. \n\nOn the other hand, she had a valid reason for not wanting people to knock\u2014maybe she was busy with the baby and couldn't answer the door. She tried multiple times to communicate her preference. The delivery person followed the sign correctly for packages, but food isn't a package. \n\nThe key point here is whether the sign's instructions were clear enough. If the sign didn't specify that packages should be left but food should be handed over, then the delivery person followed the rules as presented. However, if the sign's instructions were too vague, then maybe the author is responsible for not clarifying that the \"do not knock\" rule applies only to packages, not food deliveries.\n\nIn terms of common sense, she might expect that food needs to be handed over immediately, but the delivery person followed the sign literally. So the author might be at fault for not making the distinction clear, leading to the problem. Alternatively, the delivery person should use common sense and realize that food isn't a package, hence knock. But the author argued that common sense should've prevailed, implying she expects the delivery person to use judgment despite the sign. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. She tried to communicate her preferences, but maybe not effectively for different types of deliveries. The delivery person followed instructions, but maybe should have used judgment. However, the author might be asking for the delivery person to ignore explicit instructions in favor of common sense, which could be seen as the wrong approach. \n\nGiven that, the author might be in the wrong for not specifying that the \"do not knock\" applies only to packages, not food. The delivery person followed the sign as intended for packages, leading to the cold food. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
