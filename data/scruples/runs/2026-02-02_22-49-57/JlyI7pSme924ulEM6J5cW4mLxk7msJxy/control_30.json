I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food delivery person to knock. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a new mom with a lot of packages. She had signs and notes saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, but those were ignored. So she got a sign with courier logos to make it clear. When they ordered dinner, the delivery person didn't knock and left it outside, which got cold. The food was late, and now she's upset. Her husband says they asked for it, but she thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nSo the main points are: she had clear instructions not to knock for packages, but food is different. The sign probably only applied to packages, not food orders. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, leading to the problem. The question is whether she's in the wrong for expecting them to knock for food.\n\nI think the key here is the specificity of the sign. If the sign said \"Do not knock for packages\" but didn't cover food deliveries, then the delivery person might have acted correctly based on the sign. However, the author assumes that the delivery person should know the difference between a package and food. But from the delivery person's perspective, if the sign only mentioned packages and not food, maybe they didn't realize the rule applied to food. Alternatively, the sign was too vague, leading to confusion. \n\nThe author did try to communicate her wishes, but maybe the sign wasn't specific enough. However, the delivery person followed the sign's instruction, which the author had put up. So is the author responsible for making it clear that the sign only applies to packages? If the sign didn't specify, maybe the delivery person is not at fault. But the author expected them to knock, which they didn't because of the sign. So the author might be in the wrong for not making the instructions clearer, or maybe the delivery person didn't use common sense. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. The author's intention was to prevent knocking for packages, but the sign was interpreted to include food. The delivery person might not have realized that food is a different scenario. So maybe the author should have made the sign more specific. On the other hand, common sense would suggest that food needs to be handed over to stay hot, so the delivery person should have knocked despite the sign. But the sign was pretty explicit, so maybe the delivery person followed it correctly. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because her instructions were too broad and didn't differentiate between packages and food. She expected the delivery person to use common sense, but if the sign didn't specify, the delivery person had a right to follow the given instructions. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
