I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who has a lot of packages delivered. She tried multiple times to tell the delivery people not to knock by using signs and notes, but they kept knocking. Then she put up a sign with the company logos, which worked for the packages but backfired when they ordered food. The delivery person left the ice-cold food at the door, and now she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to prevent unnecessary noise, which makes sense, especially for a new mom who might need quiet. She made multiple attempts to communicate her request, but they were ignored. Then she created a more effective sign, which worked for packages. The problem came when the food delivery person followed the same instruction and left the food outside, leading to it being cold and possibly ruined.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and expectations. The sign was specific to packages, right? But the food delivery person might have interpreted it the same way. However, the author might not have intended for food deliveries to be left outside, especially since food is time-sensitive and requires immediate attention. She might have expected delivery people to use their judgment, but maybe the sign was too broad. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person followed the instructions as given. If the sign said not to knock, then leaving it at the door is the logical response if they can't knock to get a response. The problem is that the author's needs changed between packages and food deliveries. The sign didn't differentiate between the two types of deliveries, leading to an unintended consequence.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She tried to communicate her request clearly but perhaps didn't consider that different types of deliveries require different handling. By creating a sign that applies to all deliveries, she might have put the onus on the delivery person to discern between a package and food, which they might not be able to do from a distance. The husband's point is that they were asking for it if the sign applied to all deliveries, including time-sensitive ones like food.\n\nHowever, the author's intent was to stop knocking, which is reasonable. She might not have realized that the solution could have unintended effects. But in the end, the sign worked for packages but failed for food. So, maybe the problem is that the sign's instructions were too broad. The author might be at fault for not specifying different handling for food deliveries, but given that she's a new mom and the situation is a bit chaotic, it's understandable. \n\nAlternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense and recognized that food needs to be delivered to the door, even if the instructions say not to knock. But if the sign explicitly says not to knock, and the delivery person can't get a response, they have to follow the instruction, leading to the food being left outside.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because her intention was to reduce noise, which is valid. However, the sign's effectiveness for food deliveries wasn't considered, leading to an unintended problem. The delivery person might also share some responsibility for not making an exception. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer would be B (No) because she tried to communicate her needs and the issue was an unforeseen consequence of the sign's broad application.\n"
