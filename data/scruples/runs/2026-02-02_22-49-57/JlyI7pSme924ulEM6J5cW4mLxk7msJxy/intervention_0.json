I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a new mom who has been dealing with delivery people knocking on her door despite clear instructions not to. She created a sign with corporate logos and the message \"Do Not Knock,\" which worked for packages but caused an issue with a food delivery that was left outside and got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. She's a new mom, so she might have a valid reason for not wanting to be disturbed, maybe because she's nursing, the baby is sleeping, or she's dealing with postpartum stress. She tried multiple times to communicate her request through written notes and delivery options, but it didn't work. Creating a sign with the logos was her solution to finally get compliance. The delivery person followed the sign and left the food outside, which ended up being cold because the author hadn't expected them to do that for a food order.\n\nNow, the main question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are communication, intent, and whether the solution was reasonable. The author made every effort to communicate her request, both through written notes and using the delivery options. The sign was perhaps a bit more noticeable, but the problem arose because the sign's instructions were applied to all deliveries, including food, which is time-sensitive. The delivery person followed the instructions to the letter, but that led to a negative consequence for the author.\n\nFrom a common sense standpoint, maybe the delivery person should have used discretion, recognizing that food requires different handling. However, the author explicitly stated her request not to knock, and the delivery person adhered to that. The issue is that the author didn't consider that the same instruction might not apply to all types of deliveries. But she had no way of knowing the delivery person would follow the sign for food. The husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests he believes they should have anticipated this, but the author might not have realized the sign's broad application.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the delivery person had a duty to deliver the food in a timely and safe manner. If the sign's instructions conflicted with that, maybe the delivery person should have checked or used judgment. However, the sign was explicit, and the delivery person might not have been in a position to question it. The author might not be in the wrong because she made her request clear, but she might need to adjust her sign to specify which types of deliveries should follow the instructions. The problem here is the sign's ambiguity in categorizing different delivery types. The author's intent was to prevent disturbances, which is reasonable, but the outcome was an unintended consequence.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she made her wishes clear through multiple channels. The delivery person followed instructions, but the situation's outcome was due to a lack of specificity in the sign. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
