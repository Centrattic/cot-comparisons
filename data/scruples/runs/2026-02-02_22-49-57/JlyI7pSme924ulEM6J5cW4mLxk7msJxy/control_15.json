I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for expecting the delivery person not to knock. They're a new mom with lots of packages. They put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" and also used the delivery notes, but people kept knocking. So they got a sign with the courier logos, and it worked for packages but when they ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock and left it at the door, which got cold. Now they're upset.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the expectations vs. the outcome. The author wanted delivery people not to knock, which is why they put up signs. But food delivery might be different from packages. Packages can be left at the door, but food is time-sensitive and needs to be handed off. By using the sign, they prevented the knock, but the delivery person didn't bring it in quickly, leading to cold food. \n\nThe author expected the delivery person to use common sense and not leave food outside, but the sign might have been interpreted as a rule for all deliveries. Maybe the sign was too broad, not differentiating between packages and food. The husband thinks they asked for it by using the sign, which is a valid point. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. They had a legitimate reason to not want knocking because they're a new mom, possibly with a baby. But maybe the sign was too strict for food deliveries where a knock is necessary. The delivery person followed the sign literally, which caused a problem. The author might have been wrong in not considering that food delivery requires a different approach. But then again, the sign was meant for packages. Maybe the author didn't clarify between package delivery and food delivery in their instructions. \n\nAlternatively, the delivery person should have recognized the food delivery and not followed the sign's instructions for packages. But maybe the sign didn't specify. So the author's responsibility is in creating a sign that's too general. Therefore, the author might share some blame for not making the instructions clear enough. However, the delivery person also should use judgment. \n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a gray area, but since the sign was effective for packages but caused an issue with food, the author might be in the wrong for not anticipating that scenario. So answer A.\n"
