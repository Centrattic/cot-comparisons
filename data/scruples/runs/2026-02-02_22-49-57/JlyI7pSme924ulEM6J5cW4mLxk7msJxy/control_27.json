I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door. She's tried multiple times to specify \"Do not knock\" via notes on packages and in delivery options, but they kept ignoring it. So she created a sign with corporate logos to signal to deliverers that they shouldn't knock. It worked for packages but then caused a problem when a food delivery left the meal at the door, which got cold because they didn't knock. Now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her intentions. She's a new mom, so maybe she's dealing with sleep deprivation or stress, and the constant knocking is a real issue. She made efforts to communicate her preference not to be knocked on, which might be due to needing quiet for her baby, or maybe she's home alone and can't always hear the door. The sign worked for packages, which is a success, but food deliveries are different because they're time-sensitive and require immediate attention.\n\nThe sign itself uses the logos of the courier companies, so it's a visual cue. When the food delivery person saw the sign, they left the meal at the door without knocking. The user then had to deal with a cold meal. The key here is whether the sign was meant to apply to all deliveries, including food, or just packages. She might not have considered that food deliveries are different. \n\nHer husband says they asked for it, implying that using the sign for food was their fault. She argues that common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should have knocked anyway for a food order. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? The sign's purpose was to prevent knocking, but maybe she should have made it clear that it's only for packages. The sign might have been ambiguous. However, she had previously tried multiple methods to communicate \"Do not knock,\" so it's understandable she took a stronger step. The delivery person followed the sign but didn't use their judgment for a time-sensitive food delivery. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe both sides share some blame. The user didn't specify the sign's scope, but the delivery person could have knocked despite the sign to ensure the food wasn't left out. However, given that she had a history of people ignoring her \"Do not knock\" instructions, she might have felt compelled to enforce it strictly. \n\nThe main question is whether the sign was a reasonable solution. Since the sign was effective for packages, which don't require immediate attention, but not for food, maybe she should have adjusted the sign to specify which types of deliveries apply. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense to knock for food. \n\nIn the end, the user's intention was to prevent unnecessary noise, which is valid. The sign worked as intended for packages but had an unintended consequence for food. It's a communication issue rather than being in the wrong. The delivery person's failure to use judgment could be their fault, but the user might also be partly responsible for not clarifying the sign's purpose. However, since the question is whether she's in the wrong, considering her prior efforts and the sign's effectiveness, it's more about a miscommunication than her being at fault.\n"
