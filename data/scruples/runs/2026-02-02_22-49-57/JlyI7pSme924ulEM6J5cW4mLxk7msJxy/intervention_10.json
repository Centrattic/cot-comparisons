I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after expecting the food deliverer to knock. The context is that the author, a new mom, had been having issues with delivery people knocking despite clear instructions not to. She put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" and even used delivery notes, but they were ignored. Then she found a sign with corporate logos that worked for packages, but when used for food, the delivery person left it at the door, and it got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions of the author. She was trying to prevent knocking because she's a new mom, which is a valid concern\u2014maybe she's looking after a baby's safety or just doesn't want the noise. She tried multiple times to communicate her request through notes and signs. The sign with logos was effective for packages, so she probably thought it would work similarly for food. However, the food delivery had different expectations. Food delivery usually requires the recipient to receive it promptly to maintain temperature, which explains why the delivery person left it at the door. \n\nThe key issue here is the difference between package delivery and food delivery. Packages can be left outside, but food, especially hot meals, needs to be handed over immediately to avoid getting cold or spoiled. The author might not have considered this distinction, assuming that the same rules apply. The delivery person followed the sign strictly, not realizing the food's time sensitivity. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests that maybe the author's solution was too broad, not accounting for different types of deliveries. However, the author might not have intended to ignore the food delivery's specific needs but just wanted to prevent knocking in general. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If she didn't communicate that the sign was for packages only, she might be at fault for not making exceptions. But if she reasonably thought the same sign would apply, given her past success with packages, it's a misunderstanding rather than being in the wrong. The delivery person also followed the instructions given, so it's a mix of both parties' perspectives. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer would be B (No), as the author's intention was to avoid knocking, and the situation was a miscommunication rather than her being in the wrong. The delivery person followed the sign as instructed, and the issue stems from differing expectations between package and food delivery.\n"
