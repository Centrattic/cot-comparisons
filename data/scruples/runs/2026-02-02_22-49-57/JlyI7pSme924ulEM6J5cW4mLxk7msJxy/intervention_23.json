I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a new mom who gets a lot of packages. She's been telling the delivery people not to knock by putting signs on her door and also writing it in the delivery notes. But they keep knocking anyway. Then she found a sign with the courier logos, which worked in stopping the knocking. However, when they ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock and left the food at the door, where it got cold. The author is upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main goal was to stop people from knocking because she's a new mom, maybe with a baby sleeping, and the noise is a problem. She tried multiple ways to communicate her request, but it wasn't working. Then she used a more specific sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages, but not for food delivery. The problem is that the food delivery person didn't knock, so they left the food outside where it got cold. The author is upset because the food was supposed to be hot but ended up cold.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about communication and expectations. The author clearly communicated \"Do not knock\" in multiple ways, but maybe the food delivery service isn't covered by the same rules as the package services. The sign she used might have been intended for package couriers, not food delivery. The food delivery person might not have seen the sign, or maybe they didn't follow the same rules. Alternatively, maybe the food delivery person should have knocked regardless of the sign because food is time-sensitive and needs to be handed directly to the recipient.\n\nBut wait, the author's main point is that she expected the delivery person to use common sense. However, the delivery person followed the sign and left the food at the door. The author is upset because the food was cold. The delivery person might have thought that following the instructions is correct, but in this case, it led to a bad outcome. \n\nIs there a misunderstanding here? The author wanted no knocking for packages, but perhaps food delivery is different. Maybe the author should have made a distinction between packages and food orders. But she didn't, and the sign was general. The delivery person might have followed the sign literally, not considering that food needs to be delivered hot. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person might not have known that the food was for the author, especially if the sign is for packages. But the sign includes courier logos, which food delivery services might also use. So, maybe the delivery person was following the same rules for food as for packages. \n\nThe author's husband said they were asking for it, implying that the sign's instructions led to the problem. The author thinks common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should have knocked even if the sign said not to. But the sign explicitly said not to knock, so the delivery person followed the instruction, which is the opposite of common sense in this scenario.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the sign's instructions were applicable to all delivery services, including food. If the sign was meant only for packages, then the delivery person who delivered food shouldn't have followed it. But if the sign was all-encompassing, then the delivery person did as instructed, leading to the cold food. The author might not be in the wrong because she was trying to prevent noise, but the sign might not have been clear enough to differentiate between package and food delivery. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment, but following the sign as written. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intention was valid, but the sign's application might have been too broad. The delivery person followed the instructions, leading to an unintended consequence. However, the author's request for not being knocked on is reasonable, especially as a new mom. The delivery person should perhaps consider the nature of the delivery (food vs. package) but might not have known that. So, the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe the situation requires a better solution, like separate signs for different services or a way to communicate differently for food orders.\n"
