I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a new mom, had signs saying \"Do not knock\" for packages, but people kept knocking. She then used a sign with courier logos which worked for packages but caused a problem when a food delivery left the food at the door instead of waiting, leading to it being cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intentions. She had a valid reason for not wanting to be disturbed\u2014being a new mom, so she needs rest and managing deliveries might be stressful. She tried multiple ways to communicate her preference, including both signs and notes on checkout. The sign worked for packages, but food delivery had different expectations.\n\nNow, the food delivery scenario is different from package deliveries. Food delivery usually requires immediate attention to keep it hot, whereas packages can be left safely. The courier might not have realized that the \"Do not knock\" sign applied to food as well. The sign with logos might have been intended for package deliveries specifically, and the courier didn't distinguish between the two.\n\nThe author expected the delivery person to use common sense, but maybe the sign didn't clearly specify that it applied to all deliveries. The delivery person might not have known that waiting to hand over hot food was necessary. The husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" might be a bit harsh, considering the author tried multiple times to communicate her needs.\n\nHowever, the author might have not considered that different types of deliveries have different handling requirements. Maybe the sign should have specified \"Do not knock for packages only\" or included a note for food. But given that she had to use such a visible sign because previous efforts failed, it's understandable she wanted to keep the door clear.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She intended to stop knocking for packages, which she did successfully. The unintended consequence with food delivery was a miscommunication. The delivery person might have followed the sign literally without considering the context. The author's mistake could be not clarifying that the sign didn't apply to food deliveries, but given the context of being a new mom overwhelmed with deliveries, it's a reasonable oversight. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
