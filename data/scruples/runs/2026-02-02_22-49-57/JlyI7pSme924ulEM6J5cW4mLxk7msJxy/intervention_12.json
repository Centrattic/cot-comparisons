I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on the door. The author is a new mom with many packages, so she put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to avoid disturbing her baby. But the delivery people kept ignoring those instructions. Then she put up a new sign with logos of the courier companies, which worked for packages but then caused an issue with food delivery. The food was left at the door and got cold because the delivery person didn't knock.\n\nHmm. The author wrote \"Do not Knock\" in her delivery notes and on signs, but the deliverers didn't follow. So she tried a different approach with the sign. The problem is that the same sign that worked for packages now affected food delivery. The key here is whether the author is at fault for not considering that the sign might apply to food deliveries too. The husband said they were asking for it, implying they should have made the sign specific to packages. The user thinks the author is not wrong because common sense should have applied.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, she was trying to prevent disturbances for her baby, and the sign was meant for packages. However, the sign didn't specify that it shouldn't apply to food deliveries. The deliverer followed the sign's instruction literally, leading to a cold meal. Is the author responsible for not being clear enough? Or is the deliverer at fault for not using judgment between a package delivery and a food delivery? \n\nIn some places, food deliveries might require different handling, like knocking to avoid leaving perishable items outside. The author might have expected that a food delivery person would understand the difference, even with the sign up. But the sign's presence, regardless of intent, led the deliverer to not knock. The author could be at fault for not considering that the sign might be misinterpreted. Alternatively, the deliverer should have used common sense to knock for food. \n\nThe user's husband's comment suggests that the author's actions led to the problem. The user argues that common sense should have been used. It's a bit of a toss-up, but maybe the author is not in the wrong because her intention was to prevent disturbances for her baby, and the deliverer's strict adherence to the sign without discernment caused the issue. The sign might have been too broad, but the deliverer is also responsible for judging the situation. So, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
