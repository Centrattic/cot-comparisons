I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a new mom who has a lot of deliveries. She tried several times to tell the delivery people not to knock by using signs and notes, but they didn't listen. So she made a sign with the courier logos to make them leave packages without knocking. It worked for packages, but when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left the food at the door. The food was cold when they realized it, and the husband says they asked for it. The author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's main issue is that delivery people kept knocking despite her instructions. She used various methods to prevent this, which worked for packages. However, when it came to a food delivery, the same method was used, leading to a cold meal. The key points are: the sign was intended to stop knocking for deliveries, but food delivery might not be considered a \"package\" in the same way. \n\nThe author's intent was to avoid the disturbance of being knocked each time, especially as a new mom. She tried multiple times to communicate \"do not knock,\" but the delivery people didn't follow through. Creating the sign with the courier logos was a solution that worked for packages, which she probably wanted because she didn't want to deal with the noise or interruption. However, food delivery is different because it's time-sensitive. The delivery person left the food at the door, which led to it being cold. \n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: she wanted to prevent knocking, so the sign was effective. But she didn't anticipate that the same method would apply to food deliveries where prompt delivery is important. The problem here is that the sign might have been misinterpreted. Maybe the sign was meant for standard packages, not food, but the delivery person didn't know that. The author didn't specify that the sign applies only to packages. So, in that case, the delivery person followed the sign's instruction, which wasn't their fault. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests that using such a sign might have been an overreach. The author might have not considered the consequences for other types of deliveries. However, the author's intention was to avoid being disturbed, which is understandable, especially as a new mom. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the sign was meant to apply to all deliveries, then the delivery person was following the instructions. However, the sign might not have been specific enough. The author could have added a note indicating that the sign applies to packages only. But she didn't, so the delivery person might not have known to distinguish between package and food deliveries. \n\nIn terms of responsibility: the author intended to prevent knocking, but the method she used had unintended consequences. She didn't consider that food delivery requires a different handling. So, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but perhaps she should have made the instructions clearer. However, the delivery person also had to use common sense. If the food was meant to be handed over, maybe they should have knocked even if the sign said not to. But the sign was explicit, so they followed it. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were to prevent interruptions, which is reasonable. The delivery person followed the given instructions, leading to an unintended outcome. The author might not be in the wrong because her intent was to avoid knocking, and the sign was effective for its purpose. However, the lack of clarity about different delivery types could be a point. But overall, the mistake was on the delivery person for following the sign without considering the nature of the delivery. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
