I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's a new mom with lots of packages. She kept getting people knocking on her door even though she had signs and notes saying \"Do not knock.\" The problem was that the delivery people kept ignoring her instructions. So she made a sign with the courier logos to stop them from knocking, which worked for packages but then when she ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock, left the food at the door, and it got cold. Now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. She had a legitimate reason for not wanting to be disturbed when there are packages\u2014maybe she's busy with the baby. She tried multiple times to communicate \"Do not knock,\" but it wasn't effective. The sign with the logos was intended to prevent that, but it backfired when applied to a food delivery. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction and didn't knock, leading to the food being left outside and getting cold.\n\nThe key issue is whether her solution was reasonable. She was trying to solve a problem caused by the delivery people ignoring her previous instructions. However, the sign was for packages, not for food deliveries. The food delivery person might not have realized the sign applied to their service. But the sign had the courier logos, so maybe the food delivery person was under the impression that all deliveries should not knock. \n\nOn one hand, she had a right to want to avoid disturbances, especially as a new mom. But on the other hand, the sign might have been too broad, leading to unintended consequences. The delivery person might have thought they were following the correct procedure by not knocking. She could have specified on the sign that it's only for package deliveries, but maybe she didn't think of that. The husband said they were asking for it, implying that they should have considered the consequences of a generic \"do not knock\" sign. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were reasonable. If the sign was meant for packages, but the delivery person applied it to food, maybe the misunderstanding is on the delivery person. However, the author could have made the sign clearer. But given that she was a new mom with a lot going on, maybe the solution was a bit of a quick fix. The food being cold is a problem on the delivery person's side for not ensuring it was delivered properly. Common sense might suggest that even if a sign says not to knock, the delivery person should check if it's appropriate for the type of delivery. \n\nSo, is she the asshole? If the sign was ambiguous, maybe she's partially at fault for not clarifying. But the main issue is the delivery person not using common sense. The author's intention was to prevent disturbances, but the outcome was a failed delivery. However, the question is if she's in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether her sign was reasonable. If the sign clearly applied to packages, then the food delivery person made a mistake. But if the sign was too broad, then she's partly responsible. Since the sign had the courier logos, it's possible the delivery person thought it applied to all deliveries. So maybe she's not in the wrong because she was trying to solve a problem others weren't respecting. The delivery person should have used common sense to realize that food needs to be delivered promptly. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
