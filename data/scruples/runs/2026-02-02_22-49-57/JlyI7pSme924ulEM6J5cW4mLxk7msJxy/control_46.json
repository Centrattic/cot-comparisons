And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who has signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages. She's had issues with people not following it, so she put up a sign with courier logos. It worked for packages, but when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door, which was ice cold. Now she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's intention was to prevent people from knocking, probably to avoid disturbing a baby or to keep noise down. She tried multiple times to communicate this through notes and signs. When the food delivery person followed the sign and left the food outside, the food was cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nSo the key points are: she communicated her request clearly through signs and notes. The delivery person followed the instructions exactly, but that led to a negative outcome. The question is whether she's in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock despite the sign.\n\nI need to consider if the delivery person was wrong for not knocking when it was food. Food delivery typically requires the person to check if the recipient is available or to ensure the food is delivered properly. Leaving food at the door without checking could result in it getting cold, which is a valid concern. However, the author's sign was specific to packages, not food. The delivery person might not have realized that the sign applies only to packages and not to food deliveries. The sign includes courier logos, which might be for package delivery services, not food delivery apps like DoorDash or Uber Eats. So maybe the confusion comes from the sign being intended for packages but applied to food deliveries as well.\n\nIs the author at fault for not specifying that the \"Do not Knock\" rule applies to packages only? Or is the delivery person at fault for not using common sense, as the author mentioned? The author argues that common sense would dictate that leaving food outside would make it cold, but the delivery person followed the sign literally. The sign's effectiveness in stopping knocking for packages was a success, but it didn't account for different types of deliveries. \n\nFrom a perspective of clear communication, maybe the author should have included a note specifying that the \"Do not Knock\" rule is only for packages, not for food. However, she did use both written notes and the sign, and the food delivery person might have assumed it applied to all deliveries. On the other hand, the delivery person's job is to ensure the food is delivered correctly, so not knocking when delivering food could be seen as not fulfilling their duty.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author set up the sign to prevent disturbances, but it's possible that she didn't consider the different needs of food vs. package deliveries. The delivery person followed the instructions given, but perhaps failed to use judgment in a situation where knocking would be necessary. However, the sign didn't specify exceptions. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If she didn't make it clear that the rule was for packages only, she might share some responsibility. But if the sign was ambiguous, maybe the delivery person should have exercised better judgment. The husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests he thinks they caused the problem by having the sign. The author thinks common sense should have prevailed, but maybe the sign didn't leave room for common sense.\n\nThis is a bit of a tricky case. The answer might depend on whether the sign was too broad. If the sign was intended for packages and the food delivery person misinterpreted it, then the author might not be in the wrong. But if the sign could be reasonably understood to apply to all deliveries, including food, then maybe she's partially responsible for not clarifying. However, the main issue is that the delivery person followed the instructions without considering the nature of the delivery (food needing to be hot). So perhaps the delivery person is at fault for not using judgment, and the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe the author should have anticipated that the sign might be used for food and adjusted it. \n\nI think the key here is that the author's sign was intended for packages, and the food delivery person incorrectly applied it. The author didn't specify exceptions, but the delivery person should have known that food needs to be handed over to avoid issues. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong for expecting the sign to prevent knocking, but the delivery person made a mistake by not using judgment. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
