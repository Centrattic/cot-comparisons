I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is a new mom with a lot of packages. She's had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" in different forms, but they were ignored. So she put up a sign with specific courier logos to prevent knocking, which worked. But then when they ordered food, the delivery person left it on the doorstep, and it got cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to stop people from knocking, which she had tried multiple times. The new sign was effective for packages, but food delivery is different. Food needs to be handed off to avoid getting cold. The sign might have been too broad, including food delivery services. The delivery person followed the sign literally, but didn't use judgment to differentiate between a package and a meal needing immediate attention.\n\nThe key points here: the author's signs were ignored before, so she took action. However, the food delivery situation wasn't covered by her intent. She might not have considered that food delivery requires a different handling. The delivery person did follow the instructions, but maybe the instruction was too absolute. The author might be at fault for not specifying exceptions, but the delivery person could also be expected to use common sense. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering that the sign was meant to prevent noise, but food delivery needs a different approach, maybe the author didn't anticipate that. The husband's point is they were asking for it, but the author believes common sense should have been used. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the main issue is that the sign was effective for packages but caused a problem with food. The author might not be in the wrong because her primary need was to stop knocking, and the delivery person should have recognized that food needs to be handed over. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
