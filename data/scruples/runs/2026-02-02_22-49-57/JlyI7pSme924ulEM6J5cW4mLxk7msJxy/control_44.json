I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a new mom, is dealing with package deliveries. She had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to prevent delivery people from knocking and waking her baby. Despite writing this in notes, the couriers kept knocking. Then she used a sign with company logos that worked, but a food delivery left the food at the door, which ended up cold. The husband thinks they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nSo, I need to decide if she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, her intention was to protect her baby from being woken up, which is reasonable. She tried multiple ways to communicate the no-knocking instruction. The sign she used later was more effective, but it also led to the food being left outside, which was a problem. The key point is whether it's reasonable to expect delivery people to follow the no-knocking instruction even when it's clearly stated, especially for food which might be time-sensitive and require immediate attention.\n\nOn one hand, she made her preferences clear through signs and notes. On the other hand, leaving food at the door and not calling or texting to check if the recipient is available could be seen as the delivery person's negligence. The problem here might not be her, but the delivery person not using common sense to ensure the food is properly received, especially when it's a perishable item. However, the sign might have been too broad, instructing all couriers not to knock, which could lead to such situations. Maybe she should have specified different instructions for different types of deliveries, but that's probably too much to expect. So, considering all that, the author's main goal was to protect her baby, and the unintended consequence was the delivery mishap. The delivery person should have checked if someone was home before leaving the food. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
