I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages to avoid disturbing her baby. She had various signs and notes in the delivery options, but they were ignored. Then she got a more prominent sign with courier logos, which worked for packages but caused an issue when a food delivery person left the dinner at the door, which got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's intention was to prevent delivery people from knocking, which could startle the baby. She tried multiple methods, and the last sign was effective. However, when the food delivery came, the person didn't knock but just left it, leading to a cold meal. The husband thinks they were asking for it, but she feels it's common sense to wait or call.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe author's signs were meant to prevent knocking, which she has a valid reason for as a new mom. However, the sign might be interpreted as instructions not to knock at all, even when necessary. The food delivery person followed the sign literally, which caused the problem. But the author's main issue is with the packages, not food deliveries. Maybe she should have specified different instructions for different types of deliveries? But she didn't, so the delivery person followed the same rule. \n\nIs she at fault for not clarifying? Or is the delivery person just following orders too literally? The sign was ambiguous\u2014it said not to knock, but maybe the author should have considered that food needs to be handed over. Alternatively, maybe the delivery person should have used judgment. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is often about reasonable expectations. The author had a valid need, but maybe the solution was too broad. If the sign applied to all deliveries, including food, then she might be partially at fault for not making exceptions. However, the delivery person could have called to confirm. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong because her intent was to protect her baby, and the delivery person followed the sign. But maybe she should have had different signs. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), as her intentions were reasonable, and the delivery person's strict adherence caused the problem. The husband's comment is harsh, but the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
