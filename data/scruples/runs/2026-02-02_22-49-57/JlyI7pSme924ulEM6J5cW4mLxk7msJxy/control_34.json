I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to prevent people from knocking when delivering packages. Initially, the signs were ignored, so she got a more prominent sign with logos, which worked. But when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, leading to cold food. The author is upset about that, and her husband says they were asking for it. She questions if common sense should have prevailed.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is at fault. The key points are: she wanted to avoid being disturbed, especially as a new mom, so she put up signs. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction and didn't knock, leading to the food being left outside where it got cold. The author is upset because she expected the delivery person to use common sense and maybe check if the house was secure before leaving the food, even though the sign said not to knock.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent behind the sign. The sign's primary purpose was to stop people from knocking, which was successful. However, delivery of food typically requires some level of interaction. Leaving it at the door without knocking could be risky, especially if the house isn't secure. The author might not have considered the implications of the sign beyond just not knocking. The delivery person followed the instruction literally but didn't account for the necessity of ensuring the food is safely received.\n\nThe author's husband's comment suggests that by putting up the sign, they were responsible for the outcome. But the sign didn't say \"Please leave it at the door regardless of the circumstances.\" It just said not to knock. The delivery person might have assumed that not knocking meant to leave it at the door, but the author expected them to knock to ensure the package is safe. However, the sign explicitly said not to knock, so the delivery person had no reason to do so.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have expected that in the case of food delivery, which is time-sensitive, the delivery person would use judgment even if the sign said not to knock. Common sense might imply that for perishable items, they should check if someone is present. But the sign didn't specify that. The delivery person followed the given instruction, leading to an unintended consequence.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person acted unreasonably. The author's intent was reasonable\u2014to avoid being disturbed. The sign was a reasonable way to communicate that. The problem arose because the consequence wasn't anticipated. The delivery person did follow the instruction, but the instruction didn't account for the specific needs of food delivery. However, the author might be in the wrong because she set up the instructions that led to the situation. Alternatively, the delivery person might be at fault for not using judgment in a situation where food safety is a concern.\n\nBut in most delivery situations, following the customer's instructions is expected. If the customer said not to knock, the delivery person is supposed to follow that. The author's failure was not considering that for food, which requires different handling. So maybe the author is in the wrong because she didn't account for the different types of deliveries. However, the sign was generic, not specific to food. The delivery person might not have known to handle it differently. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong. The sign was clear, and the delivery person followed it. The unexpected consequence wasn't the author's fault because she was trying to manage the situation based on her needs as a new mom. The delivery person should have used some judgment, even if the sign said not to knock, especially with food. So the answer is B.\n"
