I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a new mom who gets lots of deliveries. They used signs saying \"Do not Knock\" but people kept knocking. Then they put up a sign with courier logos that said not to knock, which worked for packages but when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door and it got cold. Now they're upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author's intention was to prevent people from knocking, which they were doing for some reason. Maybe they have a baby and don't want to be disturbed? As a new mom, that makes sense; they might need quiet. They tried multiple ways to communicate not to knock, but it wasn't working. So they put up a more prominent sign with the logos, which worked for packages. But when they ordered dinner, the delivery person followed the sign and left it outside, leading to a cold meal.\n\nThe key points are: the sign was effective in preventing knocks for packages, but it also led to an unintended consequence with the food delivery. The author expects the delivery person to use common sense, like bringing the food inside even if the sign says not to knock. The husband thinks they \"asked for it,\" implying that the sign's effectiveness caused the problem.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they tried to communicate their needs clearly, and the sign worked as intended. However, maybe they should have considered that different types of deliveries (food vs. packages) might require different handling. The sign was specific to packages, but the food delivery person might not have realized the exception. The author's expectation was that the delivery person would knock or use judgment despite the sign. \n\nBut the sign said \"Do not Knock\" which is a direct instruction. If the delivery person followed it literally, they left the food outside. The author might be in the wrong for expecting the sign to be followed in all cases without exceptions. However, the husband's comment suggests they're being blamed for their own setup. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author's intent was good, to avoid disturbances, but the consequence was a cold meal. The delivery person probably followed the sign as instructed, not considering the food's perishability. The author might not be in the wrong because they couldn't predict the delivery person's literal compliance. Alternatively, they might be in the wrong for not making the sign clear that exceptions exist. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the sign was misinterpreted. If the sign was specific to packages, maybe the food delivery person should have known. But since the sign was general \"Do not Knock,\" it's a strict instruction. The author might not be in the wrong; the delivery person should have used better judgment. Common sense would suggest that food needs to be handed over, not left outside. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
