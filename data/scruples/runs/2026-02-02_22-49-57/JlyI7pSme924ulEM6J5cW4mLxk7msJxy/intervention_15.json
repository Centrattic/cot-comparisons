I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on the door. The situation involves a new mom who had previous issues with delivery people knocking, so she put up a sign saying \"Do not knock,\" which worked for packages. However, when ordering dinner, the delivery person left the food without knocking, leading to it being cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a valid reason\u2014being a new mom, which implies she might be dealing with a baby, so knocking could disturb the child. She tried multiple times to communicate \"Do not knock\" for packages, and only when she used a sign with the correct courier logos did it work. This suggests that delivery people were not following her instructions before, so she adapted by making a more effective sign.\n\nNow, the problem arises with the food delivery. The sign that worked for packages also affected food deliveries. The delivery person followed the sign's instructions to not knock, so they left the food at the door. The author was upset because the food was cold. The key issue here is whether the sign was meant for packages or all deliveries. The sign includes courier logos, which might be ambiguous. If the sign doesn't specify \"packages only,\" then the delivery person might reasonably follow it for all deliveries, including food.\n\nThe author's expectation is that the food deliverer should use common sense and knock despite the sign. However, the delivery person followed the sign literally. The husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" implies that the sign's presence led to the outcome, which is true. The author's intent was to prevent knocking for packages, but the sign's design might have been unclear. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. She had a legitimate concern and communicated her preferences, but the sign's ambiguity led to unintended consequences. She might be at fault for not clarifying the sign's scope. On the other hand, the delivery person should have used discretion, especially with perishable food. The author's frustration is understandable, but perhaps she didn't consider that the sign might apply to all deliveries, not just packages. \n\nIn the end, the author's intentions were good, but the execution had a flaw. So, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because the sign's lack of clarity led to the issue. However, some might argue that the delivery person should have used common sense. But since the sign was specific and the delivery person followed it, the responsibility might lie with the author for not making the sign more precise. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
