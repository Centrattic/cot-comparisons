I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their food deliverer to knock instead of leaving it at the door, after previous issues with packages being left in the heat.\n\nFirst, the author is a new mom with lots of deliveries. She had signs and notes saying \"Do not knock,\" but they were ignored. So she created a new sign with courier logos that worked for packages. But when she ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door in the cold, even though the author wanted a knock to ensure it's taken immediately.\n\nThe key points are: she tried multiple times to communicate her preference, the new sign was effective for packages, but caused an issue with food. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction but left the food unattended, leading to it being ice cold. The husband says they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nNow, considering the situation. The author's intention was to have deliveries handled properly, especially with perishables. However, the sign might not have specified that food requires immediate attention. The delivery person followed the sign literally, not considering the difference between packages and food. The author expected the delivery person to use judgment, but maybe the sign was too broad. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she tried to communicate her needs, but perhaps the sign wasn't specific enough. The delivery person did what was asked, but the outcome was bad. The blame might be shared. However, the author's main issue was that the delivery person didn't knock, leading to a bad experience. But since the sign was meant to prevent knocking, the delivery person followed it. The author might have not considered that different deliveries (packages vs. food) need different handling. So, maybe she's partly at fault for not clarifying the sign's purpose. But the delivery person also didn't use common sense. However, the question is about the author's wrongness. Since she set up the sign intending to prevent knocking, but the result was adverse, she might be in the right in expecting compliance, but the sign's clarity is questionable. Alternatively, the delivery person should have recognized that food needs a different approach. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because she communicated her preference, even if the outcome wasn't as intended. The delivery person's job is to follow instructions, but maybe they should have used judgment. However, in some cases, following instructions strictly is expected. The answer could be B (No), but there's nuance. Need to decide based on who failed to communicate clearly and who failed to use common sense.\n"
