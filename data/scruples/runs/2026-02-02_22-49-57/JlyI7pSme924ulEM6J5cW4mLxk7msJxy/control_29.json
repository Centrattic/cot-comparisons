I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a new mom who has been getting packages delivered and put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" because she doesn't want the delivery people to knock. She tried various methods to communicate this, including notes on the package and in the delivery options. The signs worked for packages but when they ordered dinner, the delivery person just left it at the door, even though it was a food delivery. The food was cold, and now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: she wanted no knocking, which was respected for packages, but for food, the delivery person didn't knock and left it outside, which caused the food to be cold. She argues that common sense should have been used, but her husband says they were asking for it. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent behind her signs. She's a new mom, which implies she might have a baby and is likely dealing with a lot, maybe needing quiet or not wanting to be disturbed. Her signs were meant to prevent disturbance, which she achieved for packages. However, food delivery is different from packages. Packages can sit outside, but food is time-sensitive and needs to be handed over quickly. So, the delivery person following the sign literally, without using common sense, led to a problem.\n\nBut is she at fault? She communicated her preference clearly, but maybe she didn't consider that food delivery requires a different approach. The sign was for \"packages,\" but maybe the delivery person didn't check the type of delivery. Or maybe the sign was too broad. The sign she used had corporate logos, which might have been for different companies, but perhaps the courier was from a different company or the sign was misinterpreted.\n\nAlternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment. Even if the sign says no knocking, for food, knocking to ensure someone is there to take it would make sense. However, the sign's instructions might have been followed to the letter, and the delivery person might not have discretion. But maybe the sign was specific to packages, not food. The author might have assumed the sign applied to all deliveries, but the delivery person might have taken it literally.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author set up the sign, but perhaps she should have made an exception for food. However, she didn't, and the delivery person adhered to the instruction without considering the context. The husband's comment suggests that they were being unreasonable by expecting the sign to not apply to food. The author argues common sense, but maybe she should have anticipated that food delivery would need a different handling.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, she communicated her preference, which was respected for packages. On the other, she didn't consider that food delivery requires immediate attention. Her husband's point is valid. But she might not have expected the sign to be followed so rigidly. The answer could hinge on whether her instructions were too broad. If the sign said \"Do not knock\" without specifying packages, maybe she's responsible. But if the sign was clear about packages, then the delivery person overstepped.\n\nLooking at the sign image (assuming it's as described), if it's a sign with logos for couriers and says \"No Knock\" for packages, maybe the food delivery person wasn't supposed to follow it. However, if the sign didn't specify, then the delivery person might have just followed the instruction regardless. The author might have been too broad with her instructions without considering different delivery types.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might share some responsibility for not making the instructions clear enough for different types of deliveries. The delivery person followed the sign literally, but maybe the author should have specified exceptions for food. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because her instructions were too broad and she didn't account for the necessity of different handling for food deliveries.\n"
