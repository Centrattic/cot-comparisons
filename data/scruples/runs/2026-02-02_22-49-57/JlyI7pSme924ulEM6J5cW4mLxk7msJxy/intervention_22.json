I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who gets a lot of deliveries. She's been asking for no knocking through various signs and notes, which worked for packages. But when she ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, resulting in cold food. She's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, her intention was to avoid disturbances, especially important for a new mom. She took steps to communicate \"Do not knock\" clearly. The sign worked for packages, but not for food. The delivery person followed the instructions literally but didn't use common sense, causing the food to be cold. \n\nThe key point is whether her sign was too ambiguous. The sign had corporate logos and \"Do not knock,\" which might be misinterpreted. But she had used similar signs before successfully. The food delivery person might not have considered that food requires immediate attention. However, the user did communicate her request, and the delivery person followed it to the letter. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests blame, but the user's intention was reasonable. The delivery person should have used judgment, even if following instructions. So, the user isn't in the wrong because she communicated her needs, and the issue lies in the delivery person's lack of common sense. Answer B.\n"
