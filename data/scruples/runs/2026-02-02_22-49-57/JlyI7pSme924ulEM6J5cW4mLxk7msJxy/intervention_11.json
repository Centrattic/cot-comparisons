I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're a new mom who gets a lot of deliveries. They've been using signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" because they don't want the delivery person to knock when dropping off packages. But those were ignored, so they made a more prominent sign with the courier logos, which worked. However, when they ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock, left the food at the door, and it got cold. The author is upset, the husband says they were asking for it, and the author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author wanted to avoid being disturbed, so they clearly communicated their preference multiple times. The initial signs and delivery notes were ignored, leading them to create a more visible sign. The sign worked for packages, but when they used the same sign for food delivery, the delivery person didn't knock, leading to a cold meal. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The main issue here is the difference between package delivery and food delivery. Packages might not require immediate retrieval, but food is time-sensitive. The author probably expected the delivery person to knock for food, even if the sign says not to. However, the sign the author used includes the courier logos, which might not differentiate between packages and food. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction but didn't account for the perishable nature of the food. \n\nThe author's intent was to prevent disturbances, which is reasonable, especially as a new mom. But maybe they didn't consider that food delivery requires a different handling. The husband's comment suggests that the author's own instructions caused the problem. The author might have assumed that delivery people can discern between packages and food, but maybe that's not a safe assumption. The delivery person might just follow the sign without considering the type of delivery. \n\nSo, the author's mistake could be not differentiating the instructions between packages and food. However, the delivery person's mistake was not using their discretion. The author's signs were clear but perhaps not nuanced enough. The author is in a position where they need to manage multiple deliveries, and their approach was to eliminate knocking. The problem arose when the same rule applied to food, which needed prompt attention. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions were reasonable, but the outcome was due to a lack of differentiation in their instructions. The delivery person followed the instructions literally, leading to the issue. However, the author might need to adjust their signs to account for the type of delivery. The blame might be shared, but the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were trying to prevent disturbances. The delivery person also has a responsibility to use common sense, which they might not have done. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
