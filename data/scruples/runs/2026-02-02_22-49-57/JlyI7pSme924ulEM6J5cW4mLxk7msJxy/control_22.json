I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who gets a lot of deliveries. She's been using \"Do not knock\" signs and notes for packages, but they kept being knocked on the door. Then she got a new sign with courier logos, which worked in stopping the knocking. However, when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left the food at the door without knocking, and it got cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to prevent knocking, which she felt was necessary, maybe because she was busy or with a baby. Using signs with courier logos was effective for packages, but not for food. The problem here is that food deliveries typically require the person to be present to receive them, especially since they might be hot and need immediate collection. Leaving it at the door could lead to cold food and potential safety issues if the delivery is supposed to be signed for.\n\nThe key points are the different expectations between package delivery and food delivery. Packages can be left at the door, but food usually isn't. The author might not have considered that food delivery requires a different handling. The delivery person might have followed the sign's instruction literally, but didn't realize that food isn't a package. The author's signs were specific to packages, but the food delivery was an oversight. So, the author might be at fault for not differentiating the instructions for different types of deliveries. Also, the delivery person might have acted on the sign without realizing the context. The husband's point is valid\u2014by having the sign, they might have contributed to the problem. The author should have made sure that the instructions were clear for food versus packages. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because she didn't account for the different handling needed for food deliveries.\n"
