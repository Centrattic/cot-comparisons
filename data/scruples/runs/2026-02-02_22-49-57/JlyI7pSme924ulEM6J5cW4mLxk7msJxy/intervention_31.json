I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who has been dealing with package deliveries and delivery people knocking on her door despite signs and notes saying not to knock. She created a sign with the courier logos that worked for packages, but when used for a food delivery, the delivery person left the food at the door, which then got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has been clear about not wanting to be knocked on the door, both with signs and in delivery notes. The sign was effective for packages, which suggests that the delivery people followed it. However, when it came to food, the delivery person didn't knock, left the food at the door, leading to it being cold. The author is upset because the food was late and cold, but she also thinks the delivery person should have used common sense. Her husband says they were asking for it.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to not knock. The sign worked for packages, but maybe food deliveries are different. Food delivery usually implies that the person might need to check in, maybe to get a signature or to ensure the food is fresh. The sign might have been misinterpreted. The delivery person might have followed the sign literally but didn't account for the perishable nature of food. \n\nOn one hand, the author had clearly communicated her preference to not be knocked, and the delivery person followed that instruction. But the result was a cold meal. On the other hand, there's an unspoken expectation that with food, you might need to interact to ensure it's delivered properly. The delivery person's job might involve some discretion in such cases. However, the author's instructions were explicit, so maybe the delivery person should have followed them regardless.\n\nThe author's intention was to avoid being disturbed, which the sign achieved. The negative consequence (cold food) might be an unintended side effect. However, the delivery person's responsibility is to deliver the food in good condition. If the sign led to the food being left at the door and getting cold, perhaps the delivery person should have used judgment to knock despite the sign, especially if food safety was a concern. But the sign was clear, so the delivery person might have thought they were following instructions. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about whose actions were more inconsiderate. The author tried to communicate clearly, but the result was a problem. The delivery person followed the instructions but didn't account for the food's perishability. However, the author's primary intention was to avoid being disturbed, which was achieved. The cold food is a consequence, but maybe the delivery person should have used common sense. The author's husband says they were asking for it, implying that their own actions led to the problem.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the delivery person followed the explicit instructions, then the author's actions led to the cold food. But if the delivery person should have exercised judgment despite the sign, then maybe the delivery person is at fault. The author's sign was specific to packages, but maybe it was too broad. The author might not have considered that food delivery requires a different approach. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she communicated her preferences, but she might not have foreseen the consequences. However, the delivery person's job requires discretion, so the delivery person might be at fault for not using common sense. The answer could be B (No), but there's a nuance here. The author's actions led to the cold food, but whether that's her fault depends on whether the delivery person should have ignored the sign in this case. Given the explicit instructions, the delivery person might have been following them, so the author's sign caused the issue, making her somewhat at fault. But maybe not entirely. This is a tough call. I think the delivery person should have used judgment, so the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
