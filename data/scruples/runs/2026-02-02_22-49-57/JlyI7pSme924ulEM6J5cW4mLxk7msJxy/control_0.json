I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new mom who keeps getting deliveries knocked on the door, even though she put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" and included notes in the delivery options. Eventually, she used a sign with corporate logos to get the message across, which worked for packages, but then when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door, making it cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author had a legitimate reason: being a new mom, maybe she can't answer the door, so leaving packages at the door is better. She tried multiple times to communicate this, but it wasn't working. Then she used a sign that worked for packages, but when a food order came, the delivery person followed the sign's instruction to leave it at the door, which led to the food being cold. The issue here is that food delivery might require a different protocol than regular packages. \n\nThe author expected that the delivery person would use common sense to not leave food outside in the cold. But the delivery person followed the sign literally. The author might be in the wrong if the sign's instructions were too broad, not considering different types of deliveries. However, the author's intention was to avoid disturbances, which is understandable. \n\nBut when the sign was followed, it caused an issue with the food. So, maybe the author didn't consider that food delivery versus regular packages might need different handling. The sign might have been too generic. On the other hand, the delivery person was just following the instructions provided, so maybe the author's sign was ambiguous. \n\nAnother angle: food delivery services often have different protocols. Maybe the user should have specified in the notes for the food order, but she thought the sign was sufficient. The husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests he feels they should have known the sign applies to packages only. \n\nIs the author at fault for not differentiating between package and food deliveries? Possibly. But the author's intention was valid, and the delivery person might not be trained to discern between different types of deliveries based on a sign. The author's mistake could be not anticipating that the sign would apply to food deliveries, leading to the cold food. \n\nAlternatively, the delivery person should have used discretion, but the sign said \"Do not knock,\" which is a direct instruction. If the sign was meant only for packages, maybe the author should have specified. But the sign didn't mention food. \n\nSo, the author's fault might be in not clarifying that the sign applies only to packages, leading to the food delivery being affected. Therefore, the answer could lean towards A (author is wrong) because the sign was too broad. However, the user might argue that the delivery person should have used common sense regardless. But given the situation, the author didn't consider the different types of deliveries, so they might be in the wrong.\n"
