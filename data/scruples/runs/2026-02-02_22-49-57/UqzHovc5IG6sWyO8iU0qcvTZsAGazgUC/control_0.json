We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for an incident that happened years ago during a cookout.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and her husband built a DIY patio and hosted a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the meat, asked the FIL if it was cooked enough, then later grilled it herself. Then, a few days later, the MIL criticized the food and told the husband how bad it was, leading to the husband being upset. The author decided not to cook for the in-laws again, and now the husband wants to move on, asking if she should cook Easter dinner. The author is questioning if she's in the wrong for holding this grudge for years.\n\nNow, analyzing the situation. The MIL's actions were inconsiderate and possibly hurtful. She publicly criticized the food, even after the cookout, which could have made the author and husband feel embarrassed or disrespected. The husband was hurt, and the author's decision to stop cooking for them as a result might be seen as justified given the MIL's behavior. The author mentions that no one else had issues with the food, so the MIL's reaction was out of line.\n\nHowever, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. The author is now being asked to forgive and move on. The husband is trying to mend the relationship, but the author feels justified in her stance. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving the MIL.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, forgiveness can be a personal choice. The author has a right to feel hurt and choose to set boundaries. The MIL's actions were unkind, and the author's response might be a way to protect her self-esteem and the family dynamic. On the other hand, holding onto a grudge could affect family relationships, but the author notes that her relationship with the in-laws is otherwise good, so maybe the impact isn't too severe.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers whether the person's actions were proportionate to the offense. The author's decision to stop cooking for six years is a long time, but given the hurt caused by the MIL's actions, it might be seen as a reasonable response. The MIL didn't apologize, which complicates things. The key is whether the author's actions were justified in response to the MIL's behavior.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The MIL was the one who caused the initial hurt, and the author's response is a form of self-respect. The husband's push to move on is valid, but the author has the right to set her own boundaries. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the author's actions are a justified response to the MIL's unkind behavior, and forgiveness isn't a requirement in this context.\n"
