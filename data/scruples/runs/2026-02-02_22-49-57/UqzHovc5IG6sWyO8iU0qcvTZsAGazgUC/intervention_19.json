We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author (TA) is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after this incident. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe TA and their husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked the FIL if it was cooked enough, then re-grilled it. Later, the MIL criticized the food to the husband, leading to him being upset. The TA decided not to cook for them again, which has been going on for six years. Now the husband wants them to move on, maybe cook Easter dinner. The TA is considering whether they're in the wrong by holding this grudge.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The MIL's behavior was hurtful and public criticism came later. The TA's reaction was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted years. The question is whether that's justified.\n\nFrom a perspective of forgiveness and family dynamics, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as long. But the MIL's actions were pretty inconsiderate. She didn't just say the food was bad in front of others; she re-grilled it, which could have been done privately. Then, going to the husband at work to criticize, which is a private setting but still very hurtful. The husband was upset, and the MIL didn't apologize. The TA's vow to stop cooking is a form of self-respect, maybe a boundary to not let the MIL's behavior affect them.\n\nOn the other hand, six years is a long time. The TA's husband is now asking to move on. The TA says they don't think the MIL has noticed, so maybe the punishment is harsher than the crime. But the TA's stance is about not allowing disrespect. The MIL's actions were a one-time event but had a lasting emotional impact. The TA might feel justified in their boundary, especially if other interactions are good otherwise.\n\nSo, is the TA in the wrong? If the MIL's actions were genuinely hurtful and the TA is protecting their own feelings, maybe not. But if the TA is holding onto anger without resolution, that's a different story. The fact that no one else had issues with the food might also play into it\u2014the MIL was the only one to criticize, perhaps more harshly. The TA's decision to not cook could be a way to not enable the MIL's potential future criticism.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, it's a bit nuanced. If the TA is choosing to set boundaries and hasn't acted out of malice but rather self-respect, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the grudge is causing unnecessary strain in the family without resolution, maybe there's room to reconsider. But the question is whether the TA is in the wrong. Since the initial action by the MIL was the problem, and the TA is reacting by not cooking, which is a personal choice to avoid a negative situation, I think the answer would lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
