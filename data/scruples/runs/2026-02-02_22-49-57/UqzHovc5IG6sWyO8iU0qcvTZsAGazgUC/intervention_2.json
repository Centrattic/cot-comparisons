We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a mother-in-law (MIL) who criticized the food at a cookout, leading the author to vow never to cook for them again. Now, the husband wants to move on and have the author cook for them again, possibly for Easter.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then later cooked it herself. Then, a few days later, the MIL criticized the food at the cookout and told her son (the author's husband) it was terrible. The husband was upset, and the author decided not to cook for them anymore. The author hasn't cooked for them for six years, and the husband now wants to move on. The author is considering whether they're at fault (AITA).\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants a second opinion. The answer should be A or B. \n\nSo, who is at fault here? Let's consider both sides. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the food, then later criticized it, which upset the husband. The author's reaction was to stop cooking for them. The author argues that no one else had issues with the food, so the MIL's criticism seems harsh. The MIL's behavior might be seen as ungrateful or disrespectful, especially since she took the opportunity to grill the meat herself. The husband was hurt by her words, which is a key point. The author's vow to stop cooking could be seen as a justified response to protect their feelings and set boundaries. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive by some. But the author mentions that the MIL might not even notice the change, and the author's relationship with them is otherwise good.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often expect forgiveness and moving on after a conflict. But the MIL's actions were hurtful, and the author's decision to stop cooking is a way to avoid further conflict. The husband's request to cook again could be about maintaining family ties. However, the author's feelings are valid if they feel disrespected. The key is whether the author's reaction is proportionate. Since no one else had a problem, the MIL's criticism stands out as unfair. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their feelings and not wanting to cook for someone who criticized their efforts. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
