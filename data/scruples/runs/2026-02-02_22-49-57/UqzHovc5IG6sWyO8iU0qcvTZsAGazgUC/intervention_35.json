We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL refused to eat the meat, sent it back to be cooked, and then criticized the food later through the husband. The author hasn't cooked for them since and is now being asked to cook Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's MIL acted ungraciously by not eating the food and then later complaining. The husband was upset, and the author made a vow not to cook for them again. The question is whether holding this grudge for six years is wrong. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, so they want to see if the AI agrees. From the description, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate. The author's decision to stop cooking for them was a personal boundary, which is a common way to handle hurt feelings. The husband wants to move on, but the author is conflicted. \n\nI should consider the context: the author is still having a good relationship with the in-laws otherwise. The MIL's actions were specific to this cookout, and no one else had a problem. The author's stance could be seen as standing up for themselves, especially if they felt disrespected. However, holding a grudge for six years might be excessive for some, but others might see it as justified. \n\nThe main factors are the MIL's unkind behavior, the author's right to set boundaries, and the time elapsed. Since the author hasn't been cooking for them now, and the MIL hasn't apologized, the lack of forgiveness could be reasonable. The author's response is about self-respect, not just the cooking. So, the answer should lean towards B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they're protecting their feelings in a personal relationship.\n"
