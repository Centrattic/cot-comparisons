We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident involving a cookout.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the story. The author and their husband built a patio and hosted a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then later grilled it herself. A few days later, the MIL criticized the food at the cookout and told the husband how bad it was, even after he confronted her. The author stopped cooking for the in-laws after that and has kept that vow for six years. The husband now wants to move on, and the author is considering whether to cook for them again, like at Easter.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nTo determine this, I should consider several factors. The author's decision to stop cooking as a form of retaliation. Was the MIL's criticism justified? Did the author overreact? How does the husband feel about this situation? Is holding a grudge for six years unreasonable? Also, the author mentions that the in-laws might not even notice the lack of cooking, suggesting the issue is more about the author's feelings than the in-laws'.\n\nThe MIL's actions were unkind and hurtful, especially considering she criticized the food in front of others and refused to apologize. The author's reaction\u2014stopping all cooking\u2014might be seen as a way to protect their husband from further hurt. However, holding onto this for six years could be considered a long time. The husband is now urging to move on, which might indicate that the author's hold on the past is affecting their current relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a good relationship with the in-laws otherwise, so maybe the issue is specific to this event. The author's vow is a personal choice, and if it's not harming others, maybe it's not wrong. But if the husband is now wanting to reconcile and move past it, the author might need to consider their marital relationship as well.\n\nAnother angle: the author might feel that the MIL's actions were inconsiderate and that the husband was hurt. The author's decision could be a way to support the husband's feelings. However, not cooking for six years might be seen as excessive. The key here is whether the author's actions are fair and if they're causing harm.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intention and proportionality. The MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and passive-aggressive. The author's reaction is a personal boundary. If the author is not being unkind but just setting a boundary, then they might not be wrong. However, if the husband is now asking to move on, the author might need to consider if their stance is affecting their marriage. But the author is not being cruel; they're just not cooking. The in-laws might not even notice, so it's a personal choice without affecting others.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're reacting to a hurtful event and have a right to set boundaries. However, holding onto it for six years could be seen as stubborn. But since the author is not causing harm and the in-laws are unaware, it's a personal choice. The husband's push to move on is separate from the author's right to hold the grudge.\n"
