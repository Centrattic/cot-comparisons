We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author's MIL criticized the food at a cookout they hosted. The MIL didn't eat the meat initially, had it re-cooked, and later complained to the husband about the food quality. The husband was upset, and the author decided not to cook for them again. Now, after six years, the husband wants to move on, but the author is still holding a grudge. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The MIL's behavior was unkind and unnecessary. She publicly criticized the food and even took over grilling, which could be seen as disrespectful. The husband tried to address it, but she didn't apologize. The author's vow not to cook for them again is a personal choice. \n\nNow, the author is being asked if holding this grudge for six years is wrong. The key points here are the length of the hold and the impact. The author hasn't cooked for them, but it's unclear if it's causing harm. They mention the MIL might not even notice. The author's husband wants to move on, which suggests a desire for family harmony.\n\nIs it wrong to hold a grudge? Well, holding onto past hurts can be valid, but after six years, it might affect relationships. However, the author isn't avoiding the MIL entirely, just not cooking. The husband's request to move on might be about maintaining family ties. \n\nOn the flip side, the MIL's actions were inconsiderate, and the author's response is a form of self-respect. The author isn't being malicious, just setting a boundary. The question is whether that boundary is unreasonable. Since the author isn't causing active harm and the MIL hasn't acknowledged the mistake, the author's stance could be justified.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They've set a personal boundary in response to a past slight, which is their right. However, the husband's perspective is about moving forward, which is a different angle. But since the MIL hasn't made amends, the author's choice to not cook isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
