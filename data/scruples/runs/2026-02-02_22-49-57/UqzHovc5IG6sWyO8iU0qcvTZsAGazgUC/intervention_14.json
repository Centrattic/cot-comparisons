We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, leading to tension with the husband, and the author has since stopped cooking for the in-laws. The husband wants to move on and have the author cook Easter dinner, but the author is holding a grudge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of all parties involved. The MIL's behavior during the cookout: she didn't eat the food, asked her husband (the FIL) if it was cooked enough, then took it back to the grill. Then, a few days later, she criticized the food to the husband, which hurt him. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted six years. The author justifies this because no one else had a problem with the food, and the MIL's actions were particularly harsh.\n\nThe key points here are about forgiveness, holding grudges, and the impact on relationships. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not forgiving the MIL. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, forgiveness is often encouraged, but it's a personal choice. The MIL's actions were disrespectful, especially coming after the event and criticizing the effort. The husband was hurt, and the author's decision to stop cooking is a way to protect themselves and their efforts. However, holding a grudge for six years might affect the relationship with the in-laws. The author mentions that they have a good relationship otherwise, so maybe the grudge isn't affecting other interactions. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the author's actions are a response to a hurtful situation. The MIL's behavior was inappropriate, and the author's choice to stop cooking is a reasonable boundary. However, some might argue that holding onto this for six years is excessive and could be seen as stubborn. But others might say it's valid to take time to heal, especially if the other party hasn't apologized. The author isn't forcing the husband to cook if he can't, so it's a personal choice without forcing others to change.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that it's time to move on, which suggests he values reconciliation. The author might be in a dilemma between their feelings and their husband's wishes. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's actions are a personal response to being wronged, and the MIL hasn't apologized, it's understandable. The answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The key is that forgiveness is a choice, and the author isn't obligated to cook if they feel hurt. The fact that others didn't have an issue with the food also supports that the MIL's criticism was unwarranted.\n"
