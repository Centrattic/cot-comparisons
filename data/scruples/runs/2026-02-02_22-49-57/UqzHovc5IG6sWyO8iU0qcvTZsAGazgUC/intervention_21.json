We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and then later confronted the husband about it, leading the author to vow never to cook for them again.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The MIL's actions during the cookout: she didn't eat the meat, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then took it back to grill herself. Then, days later, she and her husband visited the husband's workplace, and the MIL criticized the food to the husband, saying it was terrible and that she had to grill it. The husband was upset and later told her he was hurt, but she didn't apologize.\n\nThe author's reaction: vowed not to cook for them again, which they've stuck to for six years. The husband now wants to move on, suggesting cooking Easter dinner. The author is conflicted, considering that the MIL might not even notice the change, and the relationship is otherwise good.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main question is whether holding a grudge for six years is justified. The author's stance is that the MIL's criticism was harsh and unapologetic, and that the author's decision to stop cooking is a personal choice. The husband is unhappy with the author's stance but wants to move on.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, forgiveness is often encouraged, but it's also a personal choice. The author isn't causing harm by not cooking; they're simply choosing not to. The MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful, as she publicly criticized the food and undermined the effort of the author and husband. The author's decision to stop cooking could be seen as a way to set boundaries and protect their feelings. Since no one else complained and the MIL's reaction was particularly harsh, the author's resentment is understandable.\n\nHowever, some might argue that holding a grudge for six years is excessive and that the author should forgive and move on for the sake of the family relationship. But the author isn't cutting off the MIL entirely; they still have a good relationship otherwise. The author is choosing not to cook, which isn't a major issue, and the husband is willing to cook if necessary. The key here is that the author's actions (or inaction) don't harm the MIL but are a personal response to a past wrong. Since the author isn't causing ongoing harm, it's reasonable to say they're not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
