We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's mother-in-law (MIL) was at a cookout where the author and husband made a DIY patio. The MIL didn't eat the food at first, then later grilled it herself. Then, a few days later, the MIL criticized the food and complained to the husband, leading to him being upset. The author has since stopped cooking for the in-laws, and now the husband wants her to cook Easter dinner. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding this grudge for six years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the food, then later took it back to grill, which might have been embarrassing or a slight. Then she criticized the food in front of others, which hurt the husband. The author decided not to cook for them again, which has lasted six years. The husband now wants to move on, but the author is reluctant.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that no one else had a problem with the food, and the MIL's criticism was unnecessary. The author feels justified in not forgiving the MIL and not cooking for them, even though the MIL might not have noticed the change. The relationship is otherwise good, just this one issue.\n\nTo decide if the author is in the wrong, I need to assess whether their response was reasonable. Holding a grudge for six years over a past event might be seen as excessive by some. The author's action of refusing to cook for them could be seen as punishing the in-laws, not just the MIL. The husband is caught in the middle, wanting to move forward. However, the author's justification is that the MIL's behavior was hurtful and inconsiderate, and they felt wronged.\n\nIn AITA discussions, the community often looks at intent, impact, and resolution. The MIL's actions were hurtful and unkind, especially doing it after the fact and in a way that embarrassed the husband. The author's decision to stop cooking for them is a personal boundary, which is their right. But holding it for six years might be seen as too long, hence others might say the author is being too harsh. However, if the MIL never apologized, the author might feel justified in not moving on. The husband's desire to move forward is understandable as well, which complicates the situation.\n\nThe key factors are: 1) The MIL's actions were mean-spirited and public criticism. 2) The author's response was to stop cooking, which is a personal choice. 3) The duration of six years might be seen as excessive, but if there's no apology or change from the MIL, the author has a reason to hold the grudge.\n\nIn AITA, usually, if someone is holding a grudge without a valid reason or is being overly punitive, they might be the asshole. However, if the original wrong was significant and there's no resolution, the person holding the grudge might be justified. The community might split here, but the author's reasoning is that the MIL was the one in the wrong, so the author isn't necessarily the asshole. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
