We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout, leading to a strained relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and her husband built a DIY patio and hosted a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband (FIL) if it was cooked enough, then later grilled it herself. Then, a few days later, the MIL told the husband the food was terrible and that she had to grill it herself, making him upset. The author decided not to cook for them again, and now her husband wants her to move on, especially for an Easter dinner.\n\nSo the question is: Is the author in the wrong for holding onto this grudge for 6 years? The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nLet me think about the dynamics here. The MIL's actions were clearly hurtful. She criticized the food in front of others, then later confronted the husband, which caused him emotional distress. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted several years. Now the husband is pushing her to forgive and cook again, but the author is hesitant.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, holding a grudge for 6 years seems excessive, especially if there was no apology from the MIL. However, the author's feelings are valid because the MIL's actions were unkind and public. The husband's role here is also a factor\u2014maybe he wants to reconcile or feels it's time to let go. The author's decision to not cook is a personal boundary, which can be understandable if it's a way to protect herself emotionally.\n\nBut the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the author's actions are a reasonable response to protect her feelings and maintain her self-respect, then she's not in the wrong. However, if holding onto this grudge is causing unnecessary harm or preventing a good relationship, then maybe she is in the wrong. \n\nThe key here is that the MIL didn't apologize, so the author isn't obligated to forgive. The author's boundary is a personal choice, and if the MIL hasn't changed her behavior, it's justified. The husband might want to move on, but the author's feelings are valid. Since the author isn't causing harm to others by not cooking and the MIL hasn't made amends, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
