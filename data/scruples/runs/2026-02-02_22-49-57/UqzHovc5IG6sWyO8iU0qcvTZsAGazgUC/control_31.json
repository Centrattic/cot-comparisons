We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago. \n\nFirst, the incident involved a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, took it upon herself to re-grill the meat, and later complained to her son (the husband) about the food being terrible. The husband was upset, and the author decided to stop cooking for the in-laws as a result.\n\nThe key points here are the MIL's actions and the author's response. The MIL's behavior during the cookout was not just a minor comment but a public criticism that was later escalated by taking the husband aside and reiterating her complaint. The husband tried to address it, but the MIL didn't apologize. The author's reaction was to stop cooking for them entirely, which has lasted six years.\n\nNow, considering the timeline and the duration of the hold the author has kept, six years seems like a long time. While it's understandable to feel hurt, holding a grudge for so long might be seen as excessive. The author mentions that they have a good relationship otherwise, so cutting off a part of interaction (cooking) might not be necessary anymore. The husband is pushing to move on, which suggests he sees this as a past issue.\n\nHowever, the author's stance is that the MIL's actions were not just a personal critique but something that undermined their effort and hospitality. The fact that no one else had a problem with the food adds to the uniqueness of the MIL's criticism. The author's vow was a personal decision to protect their feelings, but holding it for six years could be seen as letting past hurt affect present relationships unnecessarily.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't harming anyone by not cooking for the in-laws anymore. They mention the in-laws might not even notice, so it's not causing direct harm. But the question is about being in the wrong. Holding a grudge for such a long time might be considered unhealthy or unnecessary, especially if the MIL hasn't apologized and there's no reconciliation. The author might need to consider whether letting go would be healthier for their marriage and their own peace of mind.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by not cooking. But emotionally and relationally, holding onto this anger for six years could be seen as their own issue to resolve. The answer might hinge on whether the author is allowing past hurt to dictate their actions without seeking resolution or forgiveness. The husband's perspective is that it's time to move on, which suggests he values moving past this, and the author might be in the wrong for not considering that perspective.\n"
