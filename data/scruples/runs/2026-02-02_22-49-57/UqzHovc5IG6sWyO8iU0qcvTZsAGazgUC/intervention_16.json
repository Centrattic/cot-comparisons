We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout, which led to a long-standing vow not to cook for them. The author is now being asked by their husband to move on and cook an Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The author's perspective is that the MIL publicly criticized the food, even though no one else had a problem. The MIL took it further by grilling the meat herself and later berating the husband about the food. The author stopped cooking for them as a result, and it's been six years. The husband wants to move past this.\n\nOn the other hand, the MIL's actions: she asked if the meat was cooked, then re-cooked it. Then, later, she criticized the food in front of the husband, causing him distress. The author's reaction was to stop cooking for them, which might be seen as holding a grudge, but maybe justified given the public criticism and the husband's emotional response.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author's reaction is reasonable. The author isn't cooking for the MIL anymore, which could be seen as a personal choice to protect their feelings. The MIL's behavior was unkind and hurtful, especially after others didn't have the same issue. The author's husband is now asking to move on, but the author is conflicted.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the MIL's actions were the initial transgression. The author's response is a personal decision to set boundaries. While holding a grudge for six years might be seen as long, the justification is that the MIL's behavior was particularly hurtful and the author felt it was a personal attack. The author isn't cutting off the MIL entirely, just avoiding cooking, which is a specific boundary.\n\nSo, considering that the MIL was at fault first and the author is maintaining a boundary to protect their feelings, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
