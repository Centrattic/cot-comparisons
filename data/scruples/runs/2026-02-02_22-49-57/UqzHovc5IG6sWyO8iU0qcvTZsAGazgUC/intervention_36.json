We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago. The main event was a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and took it upon herself to re-cook it, then later complained to the husband, causing him emotional distress. The author stopped cooking for the in-laws and is now being asked by her husband to move on and cook Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author's perspective is that the MIL's actions were out of line, especially since no one else had a problem with the food. The MIL not only criticized the food but also took over cooking, which could be seen as disrespectful. Then, instead of apologizing, she doubled down, which hurt the husband. The author's decision to stop cooking seems like a personal boundary set in response to that disrespect.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is pushing for reconciliation, wanting to move on. The author is conflicted, and the question is whether holding a grudge for six years is justified. The key points here are about respect, boundaries, and forgiveness. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014refusing to cook for the MIL\u2014could be seen as a way to protect their husband and themselves from further hurt. If the MIL hasn't apologized and the behavior was particularly hurtful, then the author's stance might be reasonable. However, holding a grudge for such a long time might affect family relationships. But the author mentions that the in-laws haven't noticed the absence of their cooking, and the author has a good relationship otherwise. So maybe the author isn't being unreasonable here. \n\nIt's also important to consider that the author's decision was a response to a specific incident where they felt disrespected. The MIL's actions were not just a minor complaint but a public and personal criticism that the husband found hurtful. The author's vow to stop cooking is a way to avoid similar situations. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about whether the response was proportional. Since the MIL didn't apologize and the situation was hurtful, the author's choice to set a boundary might be justified. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
