We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a woman who hasn't forgiven her mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident involving a cookout. The MIL criticized the food, even though she was the one who didn't eat it initially and then grilled it herself. The author has vowed not to cook for them again, and her husband wants her to move on, especially for an upcoming Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The MIL's actions were inconsiderate and hurtful. She publicly criticized the food, even though she had the chance to cook it herself. The husband was upset and asked her to apologize, but she didn't. The author's decision to stop cooking for them was a reaction to this, and she's maintained that for six years. Now, the husband is pushing her to move past it.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she isn't, but wants a second opinion. I should analyze the situation from both sides. On one hand, holding a grudge for six years might seem excessive. The MIL might have been harsh, but the author's response is a prolonged refusal to cook. However, the MIL's actions were disrespectful, and the author's husband was clearly hurt. The author's feelings are valid, and it's her choice to set boundaries. If the MIL hasn't apologized, the author isn't obligated to forgive. Also, the author mentions she has a good relationship otherwise, so this specific issue isn't affecting the overall relationship. The husband's desire to move on is understandable, but it's their relationship, and the author has the right to her boundaries. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
