We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL was critical of the food, even though it was cooked properly. The author stopped cooking for them after that and is now being asked by their husband to move on and cook Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The MIL was the only one who criticized the food, even though others didn't mention any issues. The author decided not to cook for them again, which has lasted six years. The husband is now suggesting moving past it. The question is whether the author is at fault (AITA) for holding this grudge.\n\nSo, the author's main argument is that the MIL's behavior was unacceptable and that they didn't apologize. The author's vow was to not cook again, and they feel justified because no one else had a problem. The husband is upset and wants to put it behind them, but the author is firm. The other family members might not have noticed the change, but the author is still holding onto this incident.\n\nNow, considering the options: A (Yes, author is in the wrong) or B (No, they are not). The user wants a straightforward answer based on the scenario.\n\nI should evaluate based on typical AITA principles. Usually, the question is about whether the person's reaction is proportionate and justified. The MIL's actions were disrespectful, as she criticized the food publicly and then took it upon herself to re-cook it. The author's husband was also hurt by her comments, and the author's response was to stop cooking for them. However, holding a grudge for six years might be excessive unless there's ongoing behavior. The author mentions that their relationship is otherwise good, so maybe the issue is isolated.\n\nThe author's vow is a personal choice, but the question is about being in the wrong. The MIL didn't apologize, so the author might not be at fault for not cooking. However, the author is being asked to cook for Easter, and the husband wants them to move on. The author's stance is that the MIL's actions were worse than others would have been, and they're not willing to cook again unless the MIL apologizes. The community often values forgiveness and moving past minor slights, especially after a long time, unless there's a pattern. Since it's a one-time event, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for not forgiving, but the husband might feel it's time to let go. The answer would depend on whether the author's reaction is reasonable. Given that the MIL was the only one to complain and didn't apologize, the author's position seems justified. However, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as harsh. But since the author only stopped cooking after the incident and the husband is now asking to move on, the author might not be wrong. The answer is likely B.\n"
