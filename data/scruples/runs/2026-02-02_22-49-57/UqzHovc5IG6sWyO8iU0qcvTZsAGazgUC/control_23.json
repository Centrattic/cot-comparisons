We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, leading to a long-held vow not to cook for them again. The husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether to comply or not.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the story. The author and their husband built a patio and hosted a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the meat, grilled it more, and then later criticized the food, even though no one else had a problem. The husband was upset, and the author decided not to cook for them anymore. It's been six years, and now the husband wants to move past it. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong for holding onto this grudge.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I should consider the actions of both the author and the MIL. The MIL's behavior seems disrespectful. She not only criticized the food in front of others but also took it upon herself to re-cook it during the event. Then, instead of apologizing, she doubled down on her criticism. That's pretty harsh. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which is a personal choice. They also mention that their husband was the one who had the conversation with his mom and the author is not the one who is unapologetic here.\n\nHowever, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as holding onto a past wrong. The author says that the MIL might not even notice the change, and their relationship is otherwise good. The husband is willing to move on, but the author is resistant. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the MIL was clearly in the wrong by her actions. The author's decision to stop cooking could be seen as a reasonable boundary. But holding onto it for six years might be considered excessive. However, if the MIL hasn't apologized and the author feels justified in their stance, maybe it's not their fault. The key here is whether the author's actions were a proportionate response. Since the author took a stand after a hurtful incident and maintained that boundary, it's possible they're not in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), as the author isn't the one who wronged the situation; the MIL did. The author's choice to set a boundary is understandable.\n"
