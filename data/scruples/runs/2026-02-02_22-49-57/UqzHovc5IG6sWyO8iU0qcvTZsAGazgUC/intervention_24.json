We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author didn't forgive their mother-in-law (MIL) for an incident that happened years ago during a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked the FIL (father-in-law) if it was cooked enough, then ended up re-grilling it. Then, a few days later, the MIL criticized the food to the husband, making him upset. The author decided to stop cooking for them and hasn't done so for six years. Now the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether to cook an Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, let's look at the MIL's actions. She didn't eat the food, questioned the cooking, and then later publicly criticized the food, even though others didn't complain. That seems harsh, especially since the food was prepared by the author and the husband. The MIL's behavior could be seen as inconsiderate and hurtful, especially since she made the husband feel bad enough that he had to walk away. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which is a personal choice. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by holding a grudge for six years. The author argues that no one else had issues with the food, and their relationship with the MIL is otherwise good. The husband wants to move on, but the author is hesitant. \n\nOn one hand, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as being stubborn or not letting go. The author's decision to stop cooking could be viewed as a way to protect their own feelings, especially since the MIL didn't apologize. On the other hand, maybe the author should consider forgiveness and make an effort to reconcile, especially if it's the husband's wish and if the MIL hasn't noticed the change. \n\nBut the key points here are the MIL's actions: being critical without any other complaints, and not apologizing. The author's response is to not cook for them, which is a personal boundary. Since the MIL continued to be negative even after the husband confronted her, maybe the author's stance is justified. The author isn't causing harm by not cooking; they just choose not to. The husband's desire to move on is valid, but the author isn't obligated to do something that's still hurtful to them. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries based on past hurtful actions, especially if the other party hasn't shown remorse. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
