We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened several years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, leading to tension, and the author has since vowed not to cook for them again. Now, the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering if they should cook for an upcoming Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked enough (he said yes), then later grilled it herself. Then, a few days later, she criticized the food to her son, causing him emotional distress. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted six years. The husband is now urging reconciliation.\n\nFrom a conflict resolution perspective, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive, especially if the MIL hasn't apologized and there's been no real effort to reconcile. However, the author's feelings are valid; they were wronged and felt hurt. The key factors here are whether the author's response is proportionate and if forgiveness is necessary for their own peace and family dynamics.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user wants a concise answer. \n\nIn many cases, holding onto resentment for such a long time without reconciliation can be seen as the person holding the grudge being at fault, even if the initial wrongdoing was justified. The author's vow to never cook again might be a self-punishment that's affecting their relationship with their husband. Also, the husband's feelings are important here, as he's caught between his parents and spouse.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and unapologetic, so forgiveness isn't required. But in terms of social norms and family relationships, moving on might be expected. The fact that the author has a good relationship with the MIL otherwise suggests that the issue is isolated, and maybe letting go would be healthier.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because holding a grudge for so long without trying to reconcile could be seen as their fault, especially if the family is pushing for healing. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the author's feelings are valid and the MIL hasn't shown remorse. But since the MIL didn't apologize and the author's action is a personal choice, maybe B is correct. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not just personal choice. \n\nThe key here is that the author's decision to not cook for six years is their own, but perhaps they're causing harm to their relationship with their husband by not letting go. The original wrong was the MIL's criticism, so the author isn't at fault for that. However, the prolonged refusal to cook might be seen as the author's choice to hold onto anger, which could be in the wrong. So, A might be the answer here.\n"
