We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their husband had a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, even though others didn't have a problem. The MIL then later confronted the husband at work, causing him emotional distress. The author stopped cooking for them as a result and has kept that vow for six years. Now the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether to cook for Easter.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. \n\nThe MIL's actions: She didn't eat the food, then later publicly criticized it, which upset the husband. The author's response was to stop cooking for them. Is that a fair reaction? \n\nOn one hand, holding a grudge for six years might seem harsh. The author might feel that the MIL's actions were especially hurtful, especially since no one else had a problem. The author's decision to stop cooking could be seen as a way to set a boundary and protect their husband's feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the husband feels that moving on is important for family relationships. The author's refusal to cook could be perceived as holding onto past resentment, which might affect family dynamics. However, the author mentions that their relationship with the MIL is otherwise good, and the MIL might not even notice the change. \n\nThe key points are: the MIL's criticism was direct and hurtful, the author's reaction was a personal boundary, and the time frame is significant. The question is whether the author's stance is justified. Since the author isn't causing harm (the MIL isn't aware, and the relationship is otherwise good), the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
