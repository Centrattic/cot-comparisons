We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a cookout where the MIL didn't like the food, even though everyone else was happy. She ended up grilling her own meat and later criticized the food, which hurt the husband's feelings. The author decided not to cook for the MIL anymore and is holding onto that vow even after six years. Now the husband wants to move on, and she's being asked if she's in the wrong for holding a grudge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The MIL's actions were pretty inconsiderate. She was the only one who didn't eat the food, even after the husband and author prepared the meal. Then she went to the husband's workplace to complain, which is pretty harsh and unkind. The husband was upset and asked her to apologize, but she didn't. That's a big deal because it shows the MIL was not respectful, and she didn't take accountability.\n\nThe author's response was to stop cooking for the MIL. That's a personal choice, but holding onto it for six years might be seen as a grudge. However, the MIL's actions were the initial cause. The author isn't being mean by not cooking; she's just not offering something after a hurtful experience. The husband wants to move on, but the author is concerned about the MIL not noticing or caring. Also, they mention that the relationship is otherwise good, so maybe the author isn't being unfair by not cooking if the MIL hasn't apologized.\n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for years can be seen as stubborn. The author's vow is a response to a past event. If the MIL hasn't changed and there's no indication she'll apologize, maybe the author is justified. However, the husband is caught in the middle, and he's trying to move forward. The question is whether the author's stance is unreasonable.\n\nBut the main issue is the MIL's behavior, not the author's refusal to cook. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to cook for someone who criticized her efforts and hurt her spouse. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because the MIL was at fault. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
