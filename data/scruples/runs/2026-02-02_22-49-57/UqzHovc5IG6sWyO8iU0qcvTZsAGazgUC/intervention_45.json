We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, there's the cookout incident. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then took it back to grill herself. The author's husband was upset when the MIL later criticized the food and said she had to do it herself. The author decided not to cook for them anymore. Now, the husband wants to move on, and the author is being asked if they're in the wrong for holding a grudge for six years.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the MIL's behavior at the cookout and her subsequent criticism. The author is holding a grudge over this, which is causing tension with their spouse. The question is whether the author's reaction is justified.\n\nLet me consider the MIL's actions. She didn't eat the food, even though others did. Then she criticized the food and told her son that he needed to cook better. That's pretty harsh, especially since no one else had a problem with the food. The husband was hurt, which the author acknowledges. The author's decision to stop cooking for them was a response to this criticism. \n\nNow, the author is being asked if they're in the wrong for not forgiving this after six years. The spouse is pressuring them to move on. From the author's perspective, the MIL's actions were unkind and unnecessary. The author feels justified in their stance because the criticism was unwarranted and hurtful, and they haven't had to cook for them since. They also mention that the MIL might not even notice the change, so maybe the grudge isn't affecting their relationship with the MIL directly.\n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as a long time. The author's husband is trying to move forward, which might be important for their marriage. However, the author's decision is a personal choice and a way to protect their feelings. The author isn't being mean to the MIL; they're just not cooking. It's a boundary. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're standing up for themselves after a hurtful event. The MIL's behavior was inappropriate, and the author has the right to set boundaries. The spouse might need to understand that forgiveness is a process and that the author's feelings are valid. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
