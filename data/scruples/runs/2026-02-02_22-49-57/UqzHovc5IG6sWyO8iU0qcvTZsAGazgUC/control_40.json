We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mother-in-law (MIL) who criticized the food at a cookout organized by the author and her husband. The MIL didn't eat the meat, took it back to grill, and later complained to her son (the author's husband) that the food was terrible. The author hasn't cooked for them since, and now the husband wants her to move on and cook for them again, specifically for Easter dinner. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for holding a grudge for six years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The MIL's behavior seems unkind. She publicly didn't eat the food, then later criticized the author's cooking, which could be seen as disrespectful, especially since the event was a cookout they hosted. The author's husband was hurt by her comments, so the MIL's actions might have been harsh. However, the author's response was to stop cooking for them entirely. That's a significant reaction. \n\nOn one hand, the MIL's criticism was personal and could have been handled more gracefully. Her comment to the husband about the food being awful and needing her to re-cook it might have been unkind, especially in front of others. The author's vow to never cook for them again shows a strong reaction, which might be seen as holding a grudge. But on the other hand, if the MIL's behavior was indeed unkind and the author felt disrespected, then the author's decision to stop cooking could be a way to set a boundary and protect their self-esteem. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not forgiving. The author's husband is asking them to move on, but the author doesn't think the MIL apologized or changed her ways. The MIL's actions might have been a one-time incident, but the author has held onto it for years. However, if the author felt that the criticism was unwarranted and the MIL was being unreasonable, then holding that resentment might be justified. \n\nAnother angle is that the author hasn't cooked for them in years, and the MIL might not even notice. The author mentions they have a good relationship otherwise. So maybe the author isn't being unkind by not cooking, just setting a boundary. The key here is whether the author's reaction is proportionate. The MIL's actions were hurtful, but the author's response is a long-term refusal to cook for them. \n\nIn some cultures or family dynamics, cooking for in-laws is expected, so not doing it might be seen as rude. However, if the author feels that their cooking was unappreciated or criticized, then it's a form of self-respect. The author might be protecting their feelings by not engaging in something that causes them stress. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. The MIL's behavior was unkind and hurtful, and the author's decision to stop cooking could be a justified boundary. The fact that they haven't cooked for years and the MIL hasn't noticed suggests that it's not causing harm to others, just a personal choice to avoid a past negative experience. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
