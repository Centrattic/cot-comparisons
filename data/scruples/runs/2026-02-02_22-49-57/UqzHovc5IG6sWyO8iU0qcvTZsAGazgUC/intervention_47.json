We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving her mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and her husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked the FIL if it was cooked enough, he said yes, but she took it back to the grill. Then, a few days later, the MIL went to the husband's work and criticized the food, saying it was awful and that she had to grill it herself. The husband was upset, and when he confronted her, she didn't apologize. The author decided to stop cooking for the in-laws, which she's kept up for six years. Now the husband wants her to move on and cook Easter dinner, but she's reluctant, thinking the in-laws haven't noticed the change.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to see if that's the case. \n\nIn terms of the author's actions, she made a vow not to cook for the in-laws due to the MIL's harsh criticism. The MIL's behavior could be seen as overly critical and disrespectful, especially since she took the opportunity to berate the food when the author's husband was at work, leading to personal embarrassment and hurt feelings. The author's decision to stop cooking is a way to avoid similar situations and protect her feelings. \n\nThe husband wants her to move on, but the author isn't sure. The key points here are: the initial incident's severity, the MIL's lack of apology, the author's right to set boundaries, and the passage of time. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't obligated to forgive or reconcile if the other party hasn't shown remorse. The MIL's actions were unkind, and the author's response is a personal choice to protect herself. The fact that others didn't have issues with the food adds to the idea that the MIL's criticism was unwarranted. \n\nAlso, the author maintains a good relationship with the in-laws otherwise, so the cooking cessation isn't affecting other aspects. Since the in-laws haven't noticed, it's not causing harm. The author is within her rights to decide not to cook, especially given the past hurt. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
