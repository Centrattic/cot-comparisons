We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving her mother-in-law (MIL) after a past incident. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, leading the author to stop cooking for them. Now, the husband wants her to move on and cook Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The author's MIL made a comment about the food, which was unkind and probably hurtful. The MIL took the meat back to the grill while others were eating, which might have been embarrassing. Then, she later criticized the food in front of the husband, leading to him being upset. The author decided not to cook for them anymore as a result. \n\nThe key points here are the MIL's behavior. She not only criticized the food but did so in a way that embarrassed the host (the author and her husband). The husband was hurt, and the MIL didn't apologize, which shows a lack of respect. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which is a personal choice. Now, the husband is asking her to move on after six years. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the MIL's actions were worse than if someone else had just said their meat wasn't cooked. Also, she mentions that the MIL might not even notice the absence of her cooking, and otherwise, their relationship is good. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as harsh, but if the MIL was genuinely disrespectful and didn't apologize, the author's reaction is understandable. The author is standing up for herself and her cooking. However, holding onto this for so long might affect the family dynamic, especially if the husband is trying to move forward. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband wants to let it go, which is a reasonable approach. But the author's stance is about respecting her own boundaries and not letting the MIL's past behavior dictate her actions. The fact that the MIL didn't apologize is a significant point. If the author feels that cooking for them again would be a step back in her personal boundaries, then she's not in the wrong for maintaining her position. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). She's protecting her feelings and standing up for herself against a disrespectful act. The husband's request to move on is valid, but the author has the right to set her own boundaries.\n"
