We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a cookout where the MIL was critical of the food, leading to a long-standing refusal by the author to cook for them again. The husband wants to move on, but the author is holding onto the past.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat, asked her husband about the meat's doneness, then re-cooked it. Later, the MIL criticized the food at work, and the husband was hurt. The author stopped cooking for them, which has lasted six years. The husband now wants to cook Easter dinner, but the author is resistant, thinking the MIL might not even notice the change.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants confirmation. \n\nFrom a typical \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) perspective, the analysis usually considers both sides' actions and the reasonableness of each. The MIL's behavior seems ungrateful and possibly inconsiderate. At a cookout hosted by the author and husband, the MIL didn't just express mild dissatisfaction but took the meat back to grill herself, implying the hosts didn't do it right. Then, she later criticized the food in front of the husband, causing him emotional distress. That's pretty harsh for someone who was a guest.\n\nThe author's reaction: they stopped cooking for the MIL and FIL, which could be seen as holding a grudge. But is that justified? The author might feel disrespected and hurt. However, after six years, is it reasonable to still hold a grudge? The husband is trying to move on, so maybe the author should consider forgiveness. But the MIL hasn't apologized, which complicates things. The author might not want to be the bigger person if the MIL isn't showing remorse.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's vow to stop cooking is a personal boundary. If the MIL's actions were a one-time event and there's no history of repeated issues, holding onto it for six years could be seen as excessive. But if the MIL is a habitual complainer or the author feels it's a significant breach of respect, then it's a valid boundary.\n\nThe user's stance is that the author isn't wrong, but maybe others would argue that forgiveness is expected here. The key points are whether the author's response is proportionate and if the MIL's actions were truly inconsiderate. Since the MIL's criticism was delivered in a hurtful way without apology, the author's refusal to cook might be a reasonable self-respect measure. However, the husband's perspective is also important, as he wants to reconcile the relationship.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks for the middle ground. If the author's actions are harming the relationship without a clear benefit, they might be at fault. But if the author is protecting their own feelings and the MIL hasn't changed, then it could be justified. Also, considering that the author might be cooking for others (Easter dinner), but the MIL's family hasn't noticed the absence, maybe the author is overthinking. The answer likely depends on cultural expectations and how the criticism was received. Since the husband was directly hurt and the author isn't cooking for the MIL anymore, and the MIL hasn't apologized, the author might be within their rights to hold the boundary. So, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
