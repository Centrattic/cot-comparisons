We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after a cookout incident six years ago. The situation is that the MIL didn't eat the food initially, grilled it more, and then later criticized the food, leading the author to stop cooking for them. The husband now wants reconciliation, but the author is still holding a grudge.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the food at first, questioned the cooking, then later told the husband how bad the food was and that she had to grill it herself. The husband was upset, but the MIL didn't apologize. The author decided to stop cooking for them, keeping that vow for years. The husband is now suggesting moving on, and the author is conflicted about cooking for Easter.\n\nSo, the main question is whether holding this grudge for six years is justified. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the MIL's criticism was harsh and unapologetic, which might have been hurtful. The author felt wronged and chose to set a boundary by not cooking anymore. That's a valid reaction to being unfairly criticized, especially if it's a one-time incident. It's important to respect one's feelings and the boundaries they set to protect themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that holding onto it for six years is excessive. Relationships can be complex, and maybe the author should try to heal the rift for the sake of the family. However, the author mentions that no one else had a problem with the food, which adds context. The MIL's behavior seems to be more about making a point or being critical rather than a genuine issue with the food. The fact that the author has a good relationship otherwise suggests that this was an isolated incident, not a pattern of behavior.\n\nThe husband's role here is also important. He had to walk away and was clearly hurt by his mother's comments. The author's vow was a response to protect themselves from further hurt, given that the MIL wouldn't apologize. If the author is willing to set aside their anger now, maybe for the husband's sake, but it's been six years without any apparent reconciliation attempts from the MIL, that could be a factor. However, the author isn't being asked to apologize or give up the grudge entirely, just to cook for Easter if the MIL's feelings aren't being hurt. The husband is still cooking for them (grilling), so maybe the author isn't expected to take over again.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They made a personal decision based on feeling disrespected and have maintained it. Forgiveness is a personal choice and doesn't mean the author has to forget or justify the MIL's actions. The fact that the MIL hasn't apologized and the incident was so one-sided (only she complained) supports the author's stance. The vow to not cook is their way of setting a boundary, and the husband is now suggesting to move on, which the author is considering. Since the author hasn't harmed the relationship beyond not cooking, and the MIL hasn't acknowledged the issue, it's reasonable for the author to hold onto that decision. So the answer should be B.\n"
