We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident at a cookout several years ago. The situation involves a DIY patio opening where the MIL didn't eat the food, grilled it more, and later criticized it, leading the author to stop cooking for them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and their husband built the patio, had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat her meat, then later said the food was terrible, blaming the author. The husband was upset, the author stopped cooking for them, and now the husband wants to move on. The author is considering if they're in the wrong for holding onto this grudge for six years.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author's reaction is justified. The MIL's actions were critical and hurtful, but the author's vow to never cook again might be seen as a long-held resentment. The author's husband is advocating for moving past it, and the author is questioning their own stance.\n\nI should consider the context: the MIL publicly criticized the meal and made the husband feel bad. The author's decision to stop cooking could be a form of passive retaliation. However, the husband is now asking the author to cook for Easter. The author might feel justified because the criticism was harsh and others didn't complain, but the question is about being in the wrong, not just the rightness of their actions.\n\nPossible angles: Holding a grudge for six years could be seen as excessive. The author might be allowing past hurt to affect a current relationship unnecessarily. On the other hand, the MIL's behavior was unkind and disrespectful, so the author's reaction isn't entirely unfounded. The author's husband is in the middle, wanting reconciliation.\n\nThe community might weigh the severity of the MIL's actions versus the length of the grudge. If the MIL was just being picky about her meat, but the author is still punishing themselves and their spouse by not cooking, that's a problem. If the MIL's criticism was personal and hurtful, the author's stance might be more understandable. But the question is about forgiveness. The author didn't forgive and is being asked if they are in the wrong.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often expect some form of forgiveness or moving on, especially if the other party isn't showing remorse. The MIL didn't apologize, so the author might feel justified in not cooking. However, holding onto this for six years could be seen as not letting go. The author might be prioritizing their feelings, which is okay, but the husband's desire to move on might indicate that the author's continued resentment is affecting the marriage.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the MIL was unapologetic and the author's reaction is a personal choice. Others might argue that it's time to let go, but the author isn't harming anyone by not cooking, and the husband can cook if needed. The key here is that the author's vow was a personal decision, and unless it's causing significant harm now, it's their right to maintain it. Since the MIL hasn't shown remorse, holding the grudge isn't entirely unreasonable. So the answer is B.\n"
