We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the story) is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago.\n\nThe situation started with a cookout where the MIL didn't eat the food, took it back to grill, and later criticized the food when visiting the husband's workplace. The husband was upset, and the author decided not to cook for them again. Now, after six years, the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering if they should cook for them, specifically for Easter.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's reaction was justified. The key points here are the MIL's behavior. She not only criticized the food but did so in a way that embarrassed the host (the author and her husband). The fact that she didn't apologize and instead doubled down on her criticism is important. The author's decision to stop cooking for them could be seen as a way to protect their self-esteem and avoid further conflict.\n\nHowever, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive by some. The author's husband is pushing to move on, and the author is considering whether they should comply. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving and moving past this.\n\nFrom a perspective of forgiveness and family relationships, it's common to be advised to let go of past grievances for the sake of family harmony. However, the author's feelings are valid; they were directly affected by the criticism, which was harsh and unapologetic. The MIL's actions were not just a minor inconvenience but a public critique that hurt the host's feelings. The author's vow to not cook again could be a form of self-respect and boundary-setting.\n\nOn the other hand, the impact of holding onto this grudge for so long is that it might create ongoing tension in the relationship with the in-laws. The husband is caught in the middle, trying to mend the relationship, while the author is standing their ground. The author might feel that their feelings were not validated if they are expected to forgive without an apology.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that no one else criticized the food, which makes the MIL's actions stand out. The author might feel singled out and that the criticism was unwarranted. If the MIL had just asked for more cooking at the time, it might not have been as big of an issue. But taking it to the husband privately and being critical then adds insult to injury.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their feelings and setting boundaries. However, the length of time (six years) might suggest that the author is holding onto the grievance longer than necessary, which could be seen as inflexible. But if the author feels that the MIL's apology is necessary and hasn't received it, then their stance is justified.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. Their decision to set boundaries based on a hurtful experience is understandable. The key here is that the author's actions were a response to a specific hurt, and they have a valid reason for their feelings. The husband's push to move on might not align with the author's need for validation, so the author's position is defensible.\n"
