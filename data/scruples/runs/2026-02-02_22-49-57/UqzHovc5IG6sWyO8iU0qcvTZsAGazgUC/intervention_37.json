We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident related to a cookout.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author and their husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked the FIL if it was cooked enough, then later grilled it herself. Then, a few days later, the MIL criticized the food to the husband, leading to him being upset. The author vowed not to cook for them anymore, and it's been six years. Now the husband wants to move on, but the author is reluctant.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for holding this grudge. They think they're not in the wrong. I need to determine if the answer is A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nLet me break it down. The key points are the MIL's initial criticism and the author's response. The author's decision to stop cooking for the MIL and her husband because of this. The question is whether holding a grudge for six years is justified.\n\nFirst, the MIL's actions: she didn't eat the food, then criticized it later. That could be seen as rude or passive-aggressive. Taking it to the husband and making him upset. The FIL's comment might have been a cover, but the MIL's actions were unkind.\n\nThe author's response: stopped cooking for them. The husband wants to move on. The author's justification is that no one else had a problem with the food, just the MIL. Also, the author mentions that the MIL might not even notice the lack of meals now, but they have a good relationship otherwise.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the MIL was inconsiderate, especially publicly criticizing the food and making the husband feel bad. The author's reaction is a personal choice. Some might say holding a grudge for six years is a bit long, but the author has a reason to be upset. The husband wants to move past it, but the author is justified in their feelings.\n\nHowever, in terms of social expectations, maybe forgiveness is expected, but it's also about personal boundaries. The author isn't hurting anyone by not cooking, and the MIL hasn't apologized. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing to set that boundary. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
