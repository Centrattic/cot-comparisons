We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman not forgiving her mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident involving a cookout.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The MIL didn't eat the food, grilled it more, and later criticized the food in front of the husband, causing him distress. The author decided not to cook for them again and has held that vow for six years. Now her husband wants her to move on and cook for them again, like at Easter. The question is whether she's in the wrong for holding this grudge.\n\nI should consider the key points here. The MIL's actions were pretty harsh. She publicly criticized the food, even though others were happy with it. The husband was upset by her comments, and the author decided to stop cooking for them as a result. The author isn't cutting off the MIL entirely, just not cooking for them anymore. The MIL and FIL have a monthly dinner, but the author isn't involved. The husband wants to move past it, but the author is conflicted.\n\nNow, from a typical AITA perspective, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as extreme. However, the MIL's actions were inconsiderate and hurtful, not just to the author but also to her husband. The author's response is a personal choice; she's not forcing anyone else, just choosing not to cook. Since other family members (like the FIL) didn't have an issue with the food, the MIL's criticism seems unwarranted. The author isn't harming anyone by not cooking, and if the MIL hasn't noticed, maybe the author is justified in her stance.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that holding a grudge for so long is unkind. The husband is trying to move on, which is healthy for the relationship. But the author's decision is a way to protect herself emotionally and not let the MIL's past behavior affect current interactions. There's also the aspect that the author has a good relationship with the MIL otherwise, so maybe the issue is just this specific incident.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person's actions are proportionate and if they're being unnecessarily harsh. Here, the author isn't cutting off the MIL, just avoiding a specific activity that caused pain. The MIL's actions were inconsiderate, and the author's response is a way to set boundaries. So, I think the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
