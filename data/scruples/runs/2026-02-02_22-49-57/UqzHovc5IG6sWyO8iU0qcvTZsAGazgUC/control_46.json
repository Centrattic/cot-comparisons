We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after a past incident.\n\nThe situation involves a cookout where the MIL didn't eat the food the couple had prepared, asked the FIL if it was cooked enough, and then later insisted on grilling it herself. Then, a few days later, the MIL criticized the food and made the husband upset, leading the author to stop cooking for them. Now, the husband wants to move on and have the author cook Easter dinner, but she's holding onto this grudge from 6 years ago.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions are justified. The key points here are the initial incident and the subsequent six-year grudge. The author's MIL's behavior could be seen as rude or unkind, especially since she publicly criticized the food and made the husband feel bad. The author's decision to stop cooking for them is a personal boundary, which might be reasonable if the MIL's actions were hurtful and the author still feels wronged.\n\nHowever, holding a grudge for such a long time might not be healthy. If the MIL hasn't apologized and the author continues to let this past event affect their relationship, it could be seen as unforgiving. But the author mentions that they have a good relationship otherwise, so this might just be one specific issue. The fact that the author isn't causing harm now, and the husband is now asking to move past it, could influence the answer. The question is whether the author's refusal to cook is justified given the passage of time.\n\nOn the other hand, the MIL's actions were inconsiderate. She not only criticized the food but also undermined the couple's efforts and made the husband walk away. The author's vow to never cook again could be a way to protect themselves from further hurt. In that case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing by their decision.\n\nBut maybe others would argue that holding onto something like this for six years is unreasonable. They might suggest that the author should forgive and move on, especially if the MIL hasn't continued similar behavior and the rest of the relationship is good. The author is making a choice that affects their own and their husband's family interactions, which could be a point of contention.\n\nI need to weigh the reasons for the author's stance against the potential for forgiveness. The author is justified in feeling upset, but the long-term hold on the grudge might make them the asshole in the eyes of some. However, since the MIL hasn't apologized and the author felt the criticism was unfair, the author's position could be seen as valid. The answer hinges on whether the duration and refusal to move on are more blameworthy than the initial incident.\n"
