We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's mother-in-law (MIL) criticizing the food at a cookout years ago, leading to a vow not to cook for them again. The husband wants to move on, but the author refuses to cook for them, specifically an Easter dinner. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the meat, checked with her husband, then re-cooked it. Then later criticized the food to the husband, leading to his hurt feelings. The author stopped cooking for them as a result. Now, the husband wants to move past it, but the author is holding a grudge.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is being unreasonable by holding onto this past event for six years. The author's reasoning is that the MIL's actions were hurtful and unnecessary, and that others didn't complain. The husband is now asking her to cook again, but she's resisting.\n\nFactors to consider: The initial incident was a minor one where the MIL was critical, but the author's response was to cut off a social activity (cooking for them) for years. The husband is caught between his mother and wife. The author claims the MIL hasn't noticed the change, so maybe the vow is more about the author's feelings than the MIL's.\n\nPossible arguments for A (wrong): Holding a grudge for six years over a minor incident is excessive. The relationship with the MIL is otherwise good, so continuing to punish her (and the husband) for a past event isn't healthy. The author is causing unnecessary strain on the marriage by refusing to compromise.\n\nArguments for B (not wrong): The MIL's behavior was disrespectful and undermined the host. The author's right to set boundaries and protect her feelings is valid. If the MIL hasn't apologized, the author isn't obligated to forgive. The husband's request to move on might be self-serving, not considering the author's feelings.\n\nBut the key here is the duration. Even if the initial action was hurtful, holding a grudge for six years without reconciliation might be too long. Also, the author's vow is affecting the marriage dynamics. The husband is seeking reconciliation, and the author is refusing, which could be seen as stubbornness rather than justified anger.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author felt disrespected and the MIL never apologized, it's reasonable to maintain some distance. However, the issue is about cooking for them, which is a choice, not a forced interaction. The author could still maintain the relationship without cooking, but chooses to take it further by refusing to cook, which might be overreacting.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at proportionality. The punishment (not cooking for six years) might be disproportionate to the offense. So leaning towards A (author is in the wrong), but there's a case for B as well. The husband's emotional response when the MIL criticized him is a factor; the author supported him then, but now is holding onto the grudge, which might not be fair to the husband.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer is likely A.\n"
