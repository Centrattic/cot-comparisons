We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a cookout where the MIL was unhappy with the food, even though everyone else ate it. The MIL later criticized the food, which upset the husband. The author decided not to cook for them anymore and is now being asked to reconsider by the husband.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author probably felt disrespected by the MIL's actions and words. The MIL came to the cookout, didn't eat, and then later criticized the food, which the author might see as undermining their effort. The author's vow to stop cooking could be a reaction to feeling unappreciated or attacked.\n\nOn the other hand, the MIL might have had a legitimate concern about the meat being undercooked. She asked her husband, who said it was okay, but she still cooked it more. Maybe she was just being cautious. Her comment after the event could have been harsh, but maybe she was venting to her son, which is common in families. The husband's reaction to walk away and the author's retaliation of not cooking again might be seen as holding a grudge.\n\nThe key points here are the initial incident and the subsequent fallout. The author's decision to stop cooking is a personal choice, and there's no indication that the MIL apologized or the situation was resolved. The husband wants to move on, but the author is holding onto this past event. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author might not be in the wrong for prioritizing their feelings and the effort they put into the cookout. However, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as excessive. The author might be justified in feeling hurt, but the question is whether their continued refusal to cook is fair. The MIL's actions were unkind, especially towards the husband, but the author's response is to stop cooking for them. \n\nIt's possible that the author is using this as a way to protect themselves from future hurt, which is understandable. However, in a family context, especially with in-laws, maintaining some level of harmony might be important. The author's husband is involved, and his feelings are part of the equation. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author's reaction is a personal boundary they set after being hurt. If the MIL was unapologetic and the situation wasn't resolved, the author has every right to decide how they handle future interactions. Plus, they mention they have a good relationship otherwise, so maybe the vow is a way to cope without affecting the rest of the relationship.\n"
