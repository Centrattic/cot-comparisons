We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened several years ago.\n\nFirst, the incident: The author and their husband hosted a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her FIL if the meat was cooked, he said yes, but she didn't eat it. Later, she went back and grilled it more. Then, a few days later, the MIL criticized the food in front of the husband, leading to him being upset. The author decided not to cook for them again since then, and their husband is now asking them to move on and cook Easter dinner. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong for holding onto this grudge for six years.\n\nSo, the key points here are the MIL's behavior during and after the cookout. She publicly criticized the food, even though everyone else was eating it. That's a problem because it can be seen as disrespectful and undermining the hosts. The husband was hurt, which also affected the family dynamics. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which they've maintained for years. Now the husband wants to move past it, but the author is hesitant.\n\nI need to consider if the author's response was justified. The MIL's actions were pretty harsh. She not only criticized the food but did so in a way that embarrassed her son, leading to him walking away. The author's vow not to cook for them again could be seen as a form of passive-aggressive retaliation, but it's also a way to set a boundary after being hurt. However, holding a grudge for six years might be excessive, especially if the MIL hasn't apologized or made amends. \n\nBut wait, the author mentions that no one else had any issues with the food. Only the MIL did. So her criticism was out of line. The author's decision to stop cooking could be a way to protect themselves from further hurt. However, if the husband is now suggesting moving on, maybe the author should consider if holding onto this is affecting their current relationship. \n\nAlso, the author says they might not even notice they haven't cooked. So maybe the author's punishment isn't affecting the MIL but is affecting their own family dynamics. If the author is still upset, perhaps they need to address it directly instead of holding a grudge. But the MIL hasn't apologized, so forgiveness might not be necessary unless the author chooses to release the grudge for their own peace of mind.\n\nIn terms of social norms, holding a grudge over a six-year-old incident where the other party hasn't shown remorse might not be seen as the author's fault. The MIL's behavior was the initial issue. However, the author's continued refusal to cook for them could be seen as holding a grudge, which is generally discouraged. But if the author is setting a boundary for themselves, it's understandable. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. The key is whether the author's actions are reasonable. Since the MIL's actions were the problem and the author is protecting themselves, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the husband is trying to move on, maybe the author should consider doing the same. However, the author isn't obligated to forgive or cook if it's still a sore point. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the MIL's actions were the root cause, and the author is within their rights to set boundaries. But there's also a case that holding a grudge for six years is excessive. However, since the MIL hasn't apologized, the author isn't necessarily at fault here.\n"
