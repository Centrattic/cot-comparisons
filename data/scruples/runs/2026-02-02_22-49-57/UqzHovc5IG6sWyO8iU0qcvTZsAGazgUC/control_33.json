We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago. The author and their husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the meat at first, asked the FIL if it was cooked enough, then later grilled it herself. Then a few days later, when the in-laws visited the husband's work, the MIL criticized the food and said she had to grill it herself. The husband was upset, tried to get an apology, but the MIL stood by her comments. The author then vowed never to cook for them again, and has kept that vow for six years. The husband now wants her to cook for Easter, but the author is resistant. They wonder if they're the a**hole for holding this grudge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The initial event was the cookout. The MIL didn't like the meat, asked her husband about it, then took it back to cook more. The author might feel that the MIL was being critical and that it was a personal attack. The follow-up was the MIL coming to the husband's work and reprimanding him, which led to the husband being hurt. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted six years. The husband is now pushing to move on, and the author is conflicted.\n\nSo, the main issue is about forgiveness and holding a grudge. The author is considering whether they should forgive the MIL and resume cooking for them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by not forgiving.\n\nI should start by analyzing the MIL's actions. She didn't eat the meat at the cookout, asked her husband about it, then took it back to cook. This could be seen as polite, as she was concerned about the meat's doneness. However, the way she later approached the husband at work and criticized the food might have been inappropriate. It's possible she was being overly critical or made it a bigger deal than it was. The husband was hurt, which indicates that the criticism was harsh or hurtful, especially in front of others or in a setting where it was unexpected.\n\nThe author's reaction was to stop cooking for them. This is a significant action, especially since they previously had monthly dinners. Holding a grudge for six years over an event that others didn't seem to comment on might be seen as disproportionate. The author argues that no one else criticized the food, which could imply that the MIL's reaction was unique and perhaps unnecessary. \n\nBut then, the author is now being asked by their husband to move on. The husband might feel that his mother's criticism was not a big deal and that the author is overreacting by holding onto this for so long. The author's stance could be based on feeling that their effort was unappreciated and that the MIL's actions were disrespectful. However, six years is a long time, and holding a vow not to cook for them might be affecting the family relationship unnecessarily, especially if the MIL hasn't acknowledged the criticism or apologized. \n\nI need to consider societal norms and expectations. In many cultures, family relationships are prioritized, and holding grudges for extended periods can be frowned upon. On the other hand, if the MIL's behavior was indeed disrespectful and the author is trying to protect their own feelings and boundaries, that might be justified. The author's refusal to cook for them could be a way to assert their own worth or to avoid future hurt. \n\nAnother angle is the context: the cookout was a shared effort between the author and their husband. The MIL criticized the food and took over the cooking, which might have been a breach of etiquette or a failure to support the hosts. The fact that the author's husband was upset and tried to address it shows that he didn't appreciate his mother's behavior. The author's decision to stop cooking after that might be a valid response to protect themselves from similar situations. \n\nBut the question is about the author's current stance. Holding a grudge for six years could be seen as stubborn or overly harsh. The author's husband is now asking them to move on, which suggests that maybe he wants to mend the relationship. The author might be reluctant because they feel the MIL hasn't changed or shown remorse. However, if the MIL hasn't noticed the author's refusal to cook, then the author's actions are more about their own peace of mind than affecting the MIL. \n\nI should also consider the author's justification. They mention that the husband is welcome to cook, but he's not a good cook. This implies that cooking is seen as the author's responsibility or that they take pride in it. If the MIL's criticism was directed at the food, which the author may have been responsible for, that could add to the hurt. \n\nHowever, moving forward could mean letting go of past grievances to maintain family harmony. If the author is holding onto the vow to avoid cooking for them, it's possible that the MIL is not even aware of the issue, so there's no ongoing conflict. The author might be right to protect their own feelings, but it's also possible that the situation isn't worth holding onto for such a long time, especially if it's affecting their relationship with their husband. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's actions are a personal choice. They felt wronged and made a vow to not cook for the MIL. If the author is comfortable with that decision and it's not causing harm (since the MIL might not notice), then maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if the husband is feeling that the author is withholding something (cooking) based on a past event, and the author is being rigid about it, that could be seen as an issue. \n\nThe key factors are: the initial event's severity, the MIL's subsequent criticism, the author's response, the duration of the grudge, and the impact on current relationships. The author might be justified in their feelings, but holding onto a grudge for six years could be considered excessive. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions are proportionate. \n\nIf the author believes that the MIL's actions were a one-time incident and that they've maintained a good relationship otherwise, maybe it's time to let go. But if the author feels that the criticism was part of a pattern of disrespect, then holding the grudge might be reasonable. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by not forgiving. \n\nSo, in the context of the story, the author is not in the wrong if they felt the criticism was unfair and they needed to set a boundary. However, if the situation is resolved and the author is still holding a grudge without cause, that could be seen as wrong. The story mentions that the author has kept the vow for six years, and the husband is pushing to move on. The author's reasoning is that the MIL's comments were hurtful and that others didn't have the same issue. \n\nIt seems like the author is not in the wrong because they had a valid reason to feel hurt and chose to set a boundary. The MIL didn't apologize, and the author's actions are a personal choice to protect their own feelings. The answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
