We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and later complained to the husband. The author has vowed not to cook for them again, and now the husband wants to move on, suggesting Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The MIL didn't just say her meat wasn't cooked; she criticized the food in front of others and later confronted the husband, causing him distress. The author's reaction was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted six years. The husband now wants to move past it.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, forgiveness can be a personal choice. The author's decision to hold a grudge might be seen as justified because the MIL's actions were hurtful and unapologetic. However, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as excessive, especially if it's affecting family relationships. But the author mentions that the MIL might not even notice the change, and the relationship is otherwise good except for this issue.\n\nOn one hand, the author has every right to feel hurt and to set boundaries. The MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and disrespectful, especially after the husband tried to address it. On the other hand, maintaining a long-standing grudge could lead to resentment. But since the author is not being asked to reconcile but to forgive and maybe cook again, it's a personal choice. The author isn't causing harm by not cooking, so maybe they aren't in the wrong. The key is whether the author's actions are unjustified. Since the MIL didn't apologize and the author's response is a boundary, it's probably not the author's fault. So the answer is B.\n"
