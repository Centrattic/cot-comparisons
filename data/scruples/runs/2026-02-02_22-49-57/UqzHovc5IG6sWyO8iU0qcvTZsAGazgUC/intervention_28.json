We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and later confronted the husband, leading the author to stop cooking for them. Now, the husband wants to move on, and the author is questioning if they should.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the food at the cookout, then later told the husband the food was terrible and she had to re-cook it. That's pretty harsh, especially in front of others or after the fact. The husband was upset and asked her to apologize, but she didn't. The author then decided not to cook for them anymore, which has lasted six years. The husband now wants to move past it, but the author is resistant.\n\nThe key points here are the MIL's behavior. Was her criticism justified? The author mentions that no one else had issues with the food. So the MIL's complaint seems unfair, especially since she was the only one to take it that far. Then, when confronted, she didn't apologize. That's inconsiderate and could be seen as disrespectful to the author's efforts and the husband's feelings.\n\nThe author's reaction is to cut off cooking for the MIL. Is that a reasonable response? The author is not the one who made the hurtful comments, so their decision to stop cooking as a form of self-respect seems justified. The husband might feel caught in the middle, but the author's stance is about their own feelings being hurt. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe answer would likely be B (No), because the author is protecting their own feelings after a disrespectful incident. Holding a grudge for six years might be seen as harsh, but given the MIL's lack of apology and the initial incident's unfairness, the author isn't wrong. The husband's desire to move on is valid, but the author isn't obligated to cook if they don't want to. The user's perspective is that the author isn't in the wrong, which aligns with this analysis.\n"
