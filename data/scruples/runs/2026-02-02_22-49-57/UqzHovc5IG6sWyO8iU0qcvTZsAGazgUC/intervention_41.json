We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves their mother-in-law (MIL) giving a hard time about the cookout food, which led to the author vowing not to cook for them anymore. Now, the husband wants to move on, and they're asking if the author is wrong for holding onto this grudge.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The MIL didn't eat the food, then later criticized it and even grilled it herself. The author's husband was upset, and the MIL didn't apologize. The author stopped cooking for them as a result. Now, the husband wants to have them over for Easter, and the author is conflicted.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. So, I need to evaluate whether the author's reaction is justified. The MIL's behavior seems ungrateful and possibly hurtful. The author's vow to stop cooking could be seen as a justified response to protect their feelings, especially since the MIL didn't apologize. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as extreme, but maybe the author is using it as a coping mechanism.\n\nBut the question is about whether they are in the wrong. The author isn't forgiving the MIL, but is that their fault? If the MIL was in the wrong by being ungrateful and disrespecting the author's effort, then the author's response is understandable. The husband's request to move on is valid, but the author is within their rights to set boundaries. The answer would depend on whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to the MIL's behavior. Since the MIL's actions were at fault, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
