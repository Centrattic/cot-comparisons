We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a cookout that went bad because the MIL criticized the food and then later spread her complaints, leading to the author's vow not to cook for them anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's MIL at the cookout didn't eat the meat and later took it back to grill it. Then, the MIL went to the husband's work and criticized the food, even after the author's husband expressed hurt. The author then stopped cooking for them, and now the husband wants to move on, asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is about forgiveness and whether holding a grudge for six years is justified. The author's actions stem from the MIL's public criticism and the husband's emotional reaction. The author's reasoning is that no one else had a problem with the food, so the MIL's actions were especially harsh. The husband is now asking for reconciliation, but the author is resistant because they feel wronged.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms and family dynamics. In many cases, holding onto a grudge for such a long time over a single incident might be seen as excessive. The MIL's behavior was unkind and hurtful, especially since she didn't apologize. The author's decision to stop cooking as a form of self-respect and boundary-setting could be seen as justified. However, the husband's push to move on might be about maintaining family relationships. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. If the author felt that their efforts were criticized unfairly and used that as a reason to set boundaries, that's not necessarily wrong. On the other hand, if the grudge is causing unnecessary strain in the family and the author isn't willing to let go of past hurt, that might be seen as being in the wrong. However, the author's actions don't seem to hurt anyone else; the MILs might not even notice. The author's stance is about personal boundaries and respect, which is a valid approach.\n\nSo, the answer here would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because they're protecting their feelings and setting boundaries after being treated poorly. The MIL's actions were the initial wrongdoing, and the author's response is a form of self-respect.\n"
