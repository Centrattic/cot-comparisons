We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a cookout where the MIL (mother-in-law) criticized the food. The author and her husband made the patio and had the cookout. The MIL didn't eat the meat at first, then re-cooked it. Later, the MIL complained to her son (the husband) about the food, leading to the husband feeling hurt. The author decided not to cook for the MIL anymore, and now the husband wants her to move on and cook Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the meat, then re-cooked it. Then she criticized the food in a way that hurt her son. The author's response was to stop cooking for them. The question is whether holding this grudge for six years is wrong.\n\nThe author's justification is that no one else had a problem with the meat, only the MIL. The husband feels the criticism was unkind, and the author stopped cooking as a result. Now, the husband wants her to move on. The author isn't sure if she's in the wrong.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's standing up for herself. The MIL's behavior was harsh and unappreciative, leading to a vow to stop cooking. The author might feel that the criticism was unfair, especially since others didn't have issues. Also, the MIL's actions in re-cooking the meat and later complaining could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut from the husband's side, he might feel that holding a grudge is damaging the relationship. He wants to move on, and perhaps he feels the author is punishing the MIL and him by not cooking. The author argues that the MIL hasn't noticed the change, but the husband might feel it's important to maintain a good relationship regardless.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's reaction is a personal choice. The MIL's behavior was probably inconsiderate, so the author's decision to stop cooking isn't necessarily wrong. However, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as excessive. But if the author feels strongly about it and the MIL hasn't apologized, it's a personal decision. The answer might depend on cultural expectations, the importance of family dynamics, and whether forgiveness is expected here.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because she's standing up for herself after a hurtful experience. The MIL's actions were the initial issue, and the author's response is a way to set boundaries. However, the husband's perspective is about moving forward. The question is whether the author is justified in her stance. Since the MIL didn't apologize and the author feels wronged, it's reasonable she holds the vow. So the answer is B (No).\n"
