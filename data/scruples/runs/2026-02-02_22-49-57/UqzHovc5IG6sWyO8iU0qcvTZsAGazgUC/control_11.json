We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago. The author and their husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, and then re-grilled it. Later, the MIL criticized the food to the husband, leading him to feel hurt. The author then decided not to cook for them anymore, and now the husband wants to move on, so they're asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not forgiving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the food, had her husband confirm it was cooked, then took it back to grill more. Then, she later complained about the food quality to the husband, which upset him. The author stopped cooking for them as a result. Now, the husband wants them to cook Easter dinner, and the author is conflicted.\n\nThe author's vow is based on the MIL's criticism. But others didn't comment on the food, which might indicate that the MIL was being particularly harsh. The author didn't cook again, which seems like a long time. The husband is pressuring to move on, but the author feels justified because the MIL didn't apologize. \n\nPossible angles: The author's reaction is a personal choice. Holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive, but if the MIL didn't apologize, maybe it's understandable. However, not cooking for them might be a passive-aggressive response. The author is standing by their decision, but the husband is involved now, wanting to reconcile. The author's stance is that they have a good relationship otherwise, so maybe the vow isn't affecting other interactions. \n\nOn the other hand, the MIL's actions were disrespectful. She criticized the food without addressing it directly to the author, instead talking to her son. That could have been hurtful. The author's refusal to cook might be a way to assert boundaries. But is it fair to hold this for six years? Maybe the author is right to set a boundary if they felt wronged. The husband's upset might have been because his parents undermined his cooking skills. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the author is not necessarily the one at fault. The MIL's behavior was the initial problem. The author's response is a personal boundary, and if the MIL hasn't apologized, the author might not be obligated to forgive. The question is whether the author's reaction is justified. Since the MIL's actions were disrespectful and the author hasn't had to cook for them since (maybe to avoid similar issues), it's a matter of being hurt and setting a boundary. The author might not be in the wrong here. \n\nBut some might argue that holding a grudge for six years is too long, or that not cooking is a disproportionate response. However, the author's reasoning is based on the MIL's failure to apologize and the specific hurtful comment. Also, the author mentions that the in-laws might not even notice, implying the vow isn't causing harm now. \n\nSo, probably the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The MIL's actions were the issue, and the author's decision to stop cooking is a boundary. The husband might need to understand the reason behind it rather than just expecting forgiveness. Unless the author's reaction is causing unnecessary issues, but they say the relationship is otherwise good. So the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
