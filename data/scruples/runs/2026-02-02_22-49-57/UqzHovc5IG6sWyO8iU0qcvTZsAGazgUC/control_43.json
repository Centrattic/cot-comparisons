We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and took matters into her own hands by regrilling it. Then later, she complained to the husband, which upset him.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author didn't cook for the in-laws after that event, keeping a vow for several years. The husband now wants to move on, suggesting Easter dinner. The author's main issue seems to be that the MIL's actions were disrespectful, and they felt justified in not cooking again. Others at the cookout didn't complain, so the author feels it's specifically the MIL's problem.\n\nThe question is about whether holding a grudge for six years is wrong. From a general perspective, holding onto past grievances for that long might be seen as excessive, especially if the relationship otherwise is good. The MIL didn't apologize, so the author might feel their feelings weren't hurt but rather that the in-laws were critical without cause. However, the author's vow could be seen as a personal choice rather than a moral wrong. \n\nI should consider if the author's actions are reasonable. The author chose not to cook, which is their right. The husband is taking responsibility by offering to cook, but maybe he's not the one who should have to do it. The MIL's behavior was inconsiderate, but the author's response is about setting boundaries. If the author is okay with the relationship as is, maybe it's not their fault. Also, the user mentions that the in-laws might not even notice, so maybe the issue is more internal for the author. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that forgiveness and moving on are important for family relations. But the author hasn't completely cut off the relationship, just stopped cooking. The problem might be the longevity of the grudge. However, if the author felt disrespected, it's understandable to want to set a boundary. The husband's feelings were hurt, but the author's stance could be a way to support their husband by not cooking again. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. The author's action of holding a grudge is their own choice, but if it's affecting the family dynamic, maybe they should consider reconciling. However, since the user hasn't provided any current issues and the relationship is otherwise good, the author's choice might be justified. I think the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they have a valid reason for their decision and it's been a long time. Holding onto past hurts isn't inherently wrong, especially if there was no apology. The author is maintaining a boundary to protect their feelings and their husband's, which is reasonable.\n"
