We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened six years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, even going as far as to re-cook it herself, and later complained to the husband. The author stopped cooking for them after that and is now being asked by the husband to move on and cook Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author made a vow not to cook again for the in-laws because of the MIL's behavior. The MIL's actions were hurtful and public, as she not only criticized the food but did it in front of others, leading the husband to feel embarrassed. The author might feel that the criticism was unfair and that the MIL didn't apologize, which justifies holding a grudge.\n\nHowever, holding a grudge for six years seems excessive. The author mentions that the in-laws might not even notice they haven't cooked for them, and the relationship is otherwise good. The husband wants to move past it, which is a common expectation in relationships to not dwell on past issues. The author's refusal to cook for Easter could be seen as prolonging the conflict unnecessarily. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have valid feelings. If the husband was upset and the MIL didn't apologize, it's understandable to feel hurt. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for still not forgiving after so long. The key points are the duration of the hold on the issue, the impact on the relationship, and whether the action was justified. \n\nThe author's response hasn't affected the in-laws' feelings since they haven't noticed, but it might affect their relationship with the husband. The husband is now asking to move on, which could be important for family harmony. The fact that the author is okay with the husband cooking if he can, but he can't, might be a factor too. \n\nIn terms of social norms, forgiveness and moving on are often encouraged, especially when the issue has already been resolved and there's no ongoing conflict. The author's stance might be seen as being overly stubborn or holding a grudge. Unless the MIL's behavior was part of a pattern, a single incident may not warrant such a long-term response. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the author's continued refusal is justified. Since the event is in the past, the in-laws don't seem to have noticed the change, and the author's relationship with them is good otherwise, it's likely that the author is not in the wrong for holding the grudge but perhaps should consider moving on for the sake of the family relationship. However, the question is specifically about being in the wrong. If the MIL's actions were a one-time thing and she didn't apologize, the author's reaction could be seen as reasonable. But the time that has passed (six years) might suggest that the author is being too rigid. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for holding onto this if they felt it was a personal slight. The MIL's behavior was inconsiderate, and the author has the right to feel hurt. However, the alternative is that the author is being unreasonable by not letting go. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer would focus on the justification. The author's vow was a reaction to a disrespectful act, so they aren't wrong for not forgiving. The husband should address the MIL's behavior instead of expecting his wife to cook despite the past issue.\n"
