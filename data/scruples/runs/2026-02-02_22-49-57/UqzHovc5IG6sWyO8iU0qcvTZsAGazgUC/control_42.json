We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, the husband and wife built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food because she thought it wasn't cooked enough. She had her FIL check, he said it was, but she still cooked it more. Then a few days later, the MIL went to the husband's work and criticized the food, saying it was awful and she had to grill it herself. The husband was upset, tried to get an apology but she didn't apologize. The wife then decided never to cook for them again. It's been six years, and the husband wants to move on, but the wife is holding onto it. The question is whether the wife is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The MIL's actions seem harsh. She publicly didn't eat the food and then later criticized it in front of the husband, without even considering that the wife might have been the one cooking. That's pretty hurtful. The wife's reaction was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted years. The husband thinks it's time to move on, but the wife isn't willing.\n\nNow, the key points: Is the wife overreacting by holding a grudge for six years? Or is the MIL's behavior the main issue here? The wife's actions are a response to the MIL's criticism and the husband's hurt. The MIL didn't apologize, so maybe the wife's stance is justified. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as extreme, even if the initial offense was wrong.\n\nBut the wife's decision not to cook for them again could be seen as a reasonable boundary to protect herself from further hurt. If the MIL was inconsiderate and the husband was hurt, the wife's reaction isn't entirely without merit. Also, the husband seems to be in the middle, wanting reconciliation but maybe not understanding the depth of his wife's hurt.\n\nThe user is asking if the author (the wife) is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the six-year grudge is excessive. However, in AITA scenarios, sometimes holding a grudge without resolution is seen as wrong, especially if it's affecting the current relationship. But in this case, the MIL hasn't apologized, so maybe the wife isn't in the wrong. The question is whether the wife is in the wrong for not forgiving. The answer might be B (No) because the MIL's actions were unkind and the wife is setting a boundary. Alternatively, if the wife is holding onto it for too long despite no ill effects on the MIL, maybe A (Yes). But given the MIL's behavior, maybe B is correct. I need to check similar AITA cases. Often, if someone is holding a grudge over a past slight without ongoing conflict, it's not considered wrong. Since the wife's relationship is otherwise good and the MIL hasn't reached out to reconcile, the wife isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
