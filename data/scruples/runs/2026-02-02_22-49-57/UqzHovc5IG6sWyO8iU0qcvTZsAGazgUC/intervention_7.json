We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after a past incident. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, leading to a conflict. The author vowed not to cook for them again, and now the husband wants them to move on, like cooking Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked about the meat, then later complained about the quality and took it upon herself to re-cook it. Then, days later, when the in-laws visited the husband's work, the MIL criticized the food, making the husband upset. He tried to address it, but she didn't apologize. The author stopped cooking for them, and now the husband wants to move past it.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate from both angles. On one hand, the author's reaction seems justified because the MIL's behavior was unkind and the husband was hurt. The author's vow to not cook again is a personal boundary, which is their right. The husband's request to cook for Easter might be about reconciliation or family dynamics, but the author isn't obligated to comply if they feel it's not worth it.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that holding a grudge for six years is excessive. But the author mentions that it's not affecting their relationship with the MIL otherwise, and they don't think the in-laws even noticed. So, maybe it's a personal choice rather than a moral wrong. The key points are the MIL's inconsiderate behavior, the husband's emotional reaction, and the author's right to set boundaries. Since the author isn't harming anyone and the MIL hasn't apologized, the author isn't in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
