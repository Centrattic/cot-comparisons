We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a cookout where the MIL didn't eat the food, later criticized it, and the author hasn't cooked for them since.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author and their husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the meat, asked the FIL if it was cooked, then later grilling it herself. Then a few days later, she criticized the food during a visit to the husband's work, making him upset. The author stopped cooking for them, and now the husband wants to move on, suggesting cooking an Easter dinner. The author is conflicted because the MIL's actions seem to be the only ones that bothered them, and they think the MIL might not even notice the change.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the MIL's behavior was pretty harsh. She didn't just politely mention the meat wasn't cooked enough; she publicly criticized the food and made the husband feel bad. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which is a personal choice. The key points here are the MIL's actions and the author's reaction. \n\nThe author hasn't cooked for them for six years, which is a long time. But the husband is now asking to move on, so the question is about whether holding this grudge is justified. The author's reasoning is that the MIL didn't apologize, and they didn't take it out on others. However, the husband's feelings are hurt because he has to interact with his parents again. The author is using cooking as a form of punishment, which might be unnecessary if the MIL isn't even aware. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to feel upset. On the other hand, holding a grudge for six years over an event that the in-laws might not even remember or care about could be seen as excessive. The author's actions are affecting their relationship with their husband. If the husband is willing to move on, maybe the author should consider that, especially if the MIL hasn't been a problem otherwise. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they have a good relationship with the in-laws otherwise. So, this incident might be the only issue. The author's vow to never cook again could be a valid personal boundary, but if it's causing ongoing strain with their spouse, maybe they need to reassess. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. Since the MIL didn't apologize and the author's actions are a response to that, the author might not be in the wrong. But some might argue that holding it for six years is too long, especially if there's no ongoing conflict. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), because the author is responding to the MIL's unapologetic criticism. The MIL's behavior was inconsiderate, and the author's refusal to cook is a way to set boundaries. However, if the husband is now suggesting reconciliation, maybe the author can choose to forgive and move on without being in the wrong. The key is that the author isn't harming the in-laws, just not cooking, and the husband is the one affected. So, the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe they could choose to let go for their husband's sake. The answer is B.\n"
