We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The MIL didn't eat the meat at a cookout, took it back to grill, and later criticized the food. She didn't apologize when confronted. The author stopped cooking for them as a result. Now, the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether they're in the wrong for holding a grudge for six years.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's reaction is justified. Let's consider the actions of both parties. The MIL's behavior could be seen as inconsiderate. She publicly criticized the food and made the husband feel bad. However, the author's response is not to confront the MIL but to cut off cooking for them. The author's husband was hurt and tried to address it, but the MIL didn't apologize. The author's vow to never cook again is a personal choice based on that experience.\n\nNow, the question is whether holding a grudge for six years is unreasonable. On one hand, the author has a right to be upset; the MIL's actions were disrespectful, and it's valid to feel hurt. On the other hand, holding a grudge for so long might be seen as extreme, especially if the MIL hasn't acknowledged her wrongdoing. The author mentions that their relationship with the MIL is otherwise good, which complicates things.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In some cultures, holding onto such a grievance might be more acceptable, while in others, moving on and maintaining family harmony is prioritized. The author's husband is urging them to move on, which suggests that the family dynamic is important to him. The author's refusal to cook could be seen as a minor punishment, but since the MILs might not even notice, it's not causing direct harm. However, it's a personal choice to maintain a grudge, which might not be fair to the husband if he wants to mend things.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person's actions are proportionate and if there's room for forgiveness. The author isn't doing anything harmful, just not cooking. The MIL's actions were hurtful, so the author's reaction might be seen as justified. But holding onto it for six years might be seen as not letting go, which could be where the 'asshole' part comes in. However, if the author isn't causing active harm and the MIL hasn't apologized, maybe it's not their fault.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author's actions are a personal response to a hurtful situation, and without an apology from the MIL, it's reasonable to hold onto that. The author isn't being malicious, just standing by their decision based on a valid reason. The husband's desire to move on is his prerogative, but the author isn't obligated to comply if they feel it's not the right time.\n"
