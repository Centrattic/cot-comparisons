We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL was critical of the food and ended up grilling her own meat. Later, the MIL criticized the food again to the husband, causing him distress. The author decided not to cook for the MIL anymore and is now being asked if they should forgive and cook an Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the food initially, then took it back to cook more. Then, she criticized the food and her son, which upset the husband. The author's reaction was to stop cooking for them, which they've done for six years. The husband now wants to move on.\n\nThe key points here are about forgiveness and holding a grudge. The author's reasoning is that the MIL's criticism was particularly harsh compared to others who didn't complain. The author feels justified in their stance because the MIL's actions were hurtful and the husband was upset. However, holding a grudge for six years over an event that might be seen as a minor social faux pas could be seen as excessive. The author also mentions that they have a good relationship otherwise, just not cooking anymore. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally or morally? Since it's a social situation, it's more about personal ethics and family dynamics. The author's actions are a personal choice, but the question is if it's acceptable or if they should let go. \n\nThe user wants a choice between A (author is wrong) and B (not wrong). The author's stance is understandable as they felt wronged, especially since the MIL didn't apologize. However, the length of time and the fact that they still have a good relationship might suggest that holding onto the grudge is unnecessary. On the other hand, the author is acting to protect their feelings and boundaries, which is valid. \n\nIn some perspectives, forgiveness and moving past old conflicts is important for family harmony. But if the author feels that cooking is a way to silently protest, and the MILs haven't noticed, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The husband wants to move on, but the author is within their right to set boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards B (not wrong) because the author has a valid reason for their feelings and the MIL didn't apologize. However, some might argue that time has passed and holding a grudge is unkind. But given the circumstances, the author's decision to stop cooking is a personal boundary, and they are not in the wrong for maintaining it."
