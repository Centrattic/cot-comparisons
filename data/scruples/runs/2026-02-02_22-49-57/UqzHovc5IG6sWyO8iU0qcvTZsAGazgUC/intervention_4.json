We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after a cookout incident.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author and her husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband about the meat's doneness, then cooked it more herself. Later, the MIL criticized the food, saying it was terrible and that she had to grill it herself. This upset the husband, and the author decided to stop cooking for them. Now, after six years, the husband wants her to move on and cook Easter dinner, but she's hesitant.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether holding a grudge for six years is justified. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion. Let me consider both sides.\n\nThe author's perspective: She took the criticism personally since everyone else enjoyed the food. The MIL's actions were public and then private criticism, which might have been hurtful. The author's vow to stop cooking could be seen as a way to protect her husband from future hurt or to avoid the same situation. But keeping a grudge for six years is a long time. Maybe she's still holding onto the hurt, and not moving on could strain the relationship. The husband wants reconciliation, and the author is questioning if it's right to hold onto this.\n\nThe MIL's perspective: Maybe she was just being honest about the food's quality. If she felt the meat wasn't cooked properly, she might have thought it was her responsibility to adjust it. But the way she delivered the criticism, especially after the cookout, could have been harsh. Taking it to the husband and not the author might have added insult to injury.\n\nIn terms of social norms, cooking for family is often a gesture of goodwill, and the author's decision to stop doing it because of the MIL's behavior might be a reasonable boundary if the MIL's actions were disrespectful. However, maintaining a six-year grudge without any attempt at communication might not be helpful. The key here is whether the author's response was proportional. She didn't confront the MIL, but made a personal decision affecting her own behavior. Since the MIL didn't apologize and continued the criticism, the author's stance could be seen as justified in setting a boundary.\n\nBut the husband is in the middle, trying to mend things. The author might be prioritizing her own feelings over family harmony. However, the husband is also capable of cooking if needed, so maybe the author isn't obligated to cook. The question is whether holding the grudge is \"in the wrong.\" If the MIL's actions were inconsiderate and the author's response is self-respect and boundary maintenance, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the situation is blown out of proportion, maybe AITA. However, the MIL's behavior seems to have been more than just a minor complaint. She took it to the husband, which could be manipulative. The author's decision to stop cooking might be a valid choice. So the answer would be B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary after feeling disrespected.\n"
