We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law. The situation is about a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout, even though others ate it. The author has since stopped cooking for them and is being asked by their husband to move on, perhaps for Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The MIL was the only one who didn't like the food and ended up grilling it herself. Then she later criticized the food and blamed the author's cooking. The husband was hurt by this. The author decided not to cook for them again and has kept that vow for six years. Now the husband wants to move on, but the author is reluctant.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, holding a grudge for six years is a long time. But maybe the MIL's behavior was unkind and the author's response is about setting boundaries. The author isn't cutting off the MIL entirely, just not cooking for them. The MIL's actions were pretty harsh, especially since she took the food issue to the husband and refused to apologize. The author's vow is a form of self-respect and not allowing criticism that was unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that holding a grudge for that long isn't healthy, especially in a family context. Maybe the author should consider forgiveness for their own peace of mind. But the author isn't in a bad relationship with the MIL otherwise, so maybe it's a small part of the relationship. The key is whether the author's actions are justified given the MIL's behavior. Since the MIL was the only one with a problem and acted unkindly, the author's decision to stop cooking seems reasonable. The answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
