We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and ended up re-cooking it herself. Then, a few days later, she told the husband's colleague that the food was terrible, leading to the husband being upset. The author stopped cooking for them since then, and now the husband wants to move on.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's MIL didn't eat the food, questioned if it was cooked enough, then later criticized the author's cooking, even though others didn't mention any issues. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted six years. The husband is now suggesting to let go of the grudge and cook Easter dinner.\n\nSo, the question is whether holding a grudge for six years over this incident makes the author the \"asshole\" in the situation. Let's break down the elements. The MIL's actions were inconsiderate and possibly hurtful, as she publicly criticized the food and made the husband uncomfortable. The author's reaction was to stop cooking, which is a personal choice. The author mentions they have a good relationship otherwise, so maybe this is just one issue among many.\n\nI need to consider if the author's reaction is excessive. The MIL took the opportunity to give a harsh critique after the event, which the husband found upsetting. The author's vow to never cook again for them might be a way to protect their feelings, especially if they felt disrespected. However, holding onto that for six years could be seen as not letting go, potentially affecting family relations. The husband is now urging to move past it, but the author is conflicted.\n\nOn the other hand, the MIL's actions might have been rude and unnecessary. If she had a problem with the meat's doneness, maybe she could have handled it more politely. The fact that others ate without issue suggests the problem was only with the MIL. The author might feel justified in their reaction, as the criticism was personal and came from a family member.\n\nBut is the author wrong for not forgiving? It depends on perspective. Forgiveness is important for personal well-being and family harmony. The author's decision to stop cooking is a boundary they set to protect themselves. However, if the MIL never apologized and the author hasn't addressed the issue directly with her, maybe the resentment is being held onto unfairly. The author might be letting past hurt affect current relationships without resolution.\n\nThe husband's role is also a factor. He was the one who was hurt by his mother's words and tried to address it, but she didn't apologize. The author is now in a position where they are choosing not to cook, but the husband wants to move forward. The author's stance could be seen as reasonable if they feel their efforts aren't appreciated or respected.\n\nHowever, maybe the author should consider if holding this grudge is causing unnecessary tension now. The MIL might not even realize the impact of her actions. Cooking Easter dinner could be an opportunity to show grace, even if the MIL's behavior was problematic. The author's argument is that no one else had a problem, so perhaps they are overreacting, but if the MIL's critique was especially hurtful, then it's valid.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting a boundary to protect their feelings. But if the situation has been resolved and the author is still holding onto the past without any attempt at reconciliation, maybe that's the problem. The key is whether the author's current actions are affecting their relationship negatively. The story says they have a good relationship otherwise, so maybe the author is justified in maintaining the boundary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should let it go for the sake of the husband and the family dynamic. But the author is making it clear that they won't cook again, and the husband is okay with cooking for them, so perhaps it's not a major issue. The question is about being in the wrong. If the author's actions are a result of self-respect and not letting someone else's criticism dominate their behavior, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if it's an unyielding grudge without any attempt to communicate, that could be seen as negative.\n\nThe answer likely hinges on whether the author's reaction is proportionate. The MIL's behavior was rude, and the author's response was to protect themselves. Since the author hasn't cooked for them in years, maybe it's time to reassess if the boundary is still necessary. But the author might feel it's important to maintain that line. The husband's suggestion to move on could be about healing the relationship, but the author's refusal to cook is a personal choice. \n\nSo, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to stop cooking after being disrespected. The MIL's actions were the root cause, and the author is standing up for themselves. The husband might need to accept that his wife has a boundary here. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
