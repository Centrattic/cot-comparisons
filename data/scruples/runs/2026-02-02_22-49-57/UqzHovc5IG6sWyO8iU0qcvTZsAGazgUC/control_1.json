We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple had a cookout for their patio opening, and the MIL didn't eat the food, took it back to grill, and later criticized the food to the husband, causing him distress. The author stopped cooking for them after that and is now being asked by the husband to move on, specifically to cook Easter dinner.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author's MIL was unkind and took over during the cookout. The author decided not to cook for them again as a result. The husband is now pushing for reconciliation. The author questions if they're being too harsh, especially since others didn't have issues with the food, and the MIL didn't apologize.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The MIL's actions: she didn't like the food, took it upon herself to reheat it, and then later criticized the author's cooking to her son. That's pretty rude, especially in a social situation. The author's response was to vow not to cook for them again, which they've followed through on. \n\nThe author's reasoning: They feel justified because no one else had issues, and the MIL didn't apologize. They also mention that the husband was hurt, so they might have a valid emotional response. The question is whether holding a grudge for six years is fair. \n\nOn one hand, holding onto past hurt for such a long time might not be healthy, especially if it's affecting the relationship with the husband. The author's husband is asking them to move on, so there's a family dynamic here. But on the other hand, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and dismissive. The author's decision not to cook could be seen as a form of self-respect, avoiding a situation where their efforts might be criticized again.\n\nHowever, the key issue is forgiveness. The author hasn't forgiven the MIL for the past action. Is that wrong? It depends on the perspective. If the MIL never apologized or showed remorse, maybe the author is justified in not letting it go. But the problem is about the author's vow and whether it's fair to hold onto it. \n\nAlso, the author says they might have a good relationship with the MIL otherwise. So maybe this is a small part of a larger, mostly good relationship. The husband's cooking skills are limited, so if he's not a good cook, maybe the author's contribution to family events is important. But the author is making a point about not cooking for them again out of principle.\n\nAnother angle: the author is using this incident as a reason to not engage in future family events. If the MIL hasn't changed and the author still feels the same, maybe it's okay. But if six years is too long, maybe the author should reconsider. The community often suggests that holding grudges can be harmful, but the initial action by the MIL was pretty harsh. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community usually looks at both sides. The MIL was in the wrong by being ungrateful and criticizing the food after taking it upon herself to reheat it. The author's response was to not cook for them, which is a personal choice. The question is, is the author the asshole for not forgiving? \n\nI think the answer would be B (No), because the MIL's actions were unkind and the author's reaction is about self-respect and setting boundaries. The husband's request might be valid, but the author isn't obligated to cook for someone who disrespected them. Unless the author's husband is pressuring them in a way that's causing a bigger issue, but the main point is about forgiveness. Since the MIL didn't apologize, the author's stance seems justified. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
