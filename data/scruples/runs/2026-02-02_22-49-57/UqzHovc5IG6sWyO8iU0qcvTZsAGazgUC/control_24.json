We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a conflict between the author and her mother-in-law (MIL) over a past cookout. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author and her husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then later re-cooked it. Then a few days later, the MIL criticized the food and told the husband how terrible it was, leading to him being upset. The author now refuses to cook for them, even after six years, and the husband wants to move on.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not forgiving her MIL and not cooking for them. The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). Let me break it down.\n\nThe key points here are:\n1. The MIL's actions: She didn't eat the food, asked her husband about it, then took it back to grill. Then later criticized the food in a way that upset the husband. That's a breach of etiquette, right? Publicly criticizing the food, especially when the host is trying to be generous. That's probably hurtful and unnecessary. The MIL's behavior was unkind and could have been handled better. If the food wasn't to her liking, she could have just declined politely without criticizing in front of others.\n\n2. The husband's reaction: He was hurt and walked away. The author supported him by vowing not to cook for the MIL. Now, after six years, the husband wants to move on, but the author is still holding a grudge. \n\n3. The author's perspective: She feels justified because no one else had issues with the food. The MIL's criticism was harsh and unapologetic. The author's vow is a form of self-respect, perhaps. But is holding a grudge for six years reasonable? Maybe. If the MIL hasn't apologized and has shown no remorse, the author might feel it's justified.\n\n4. The current situation: The author hasn't cooked for them in years, but the husband wants to cook for them, though he can't cook much except grilling. The author is being asked if she's in the wrong for not cooking, even if the MILs might not notice.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as harsh. However, if the initial incident was genuinely hurtful and the other party never apologized, the author might feel it's reasonable. The MIL's actions were unkind and disrespectful, especially towards the host. The author's decision to stop cooking is a boundary she set in response. \n\nBut forgiveness and moving on can be important for family relationships. The husband is trying to mend things, which is understandable. However, the author isn't hurting anyone by not cooking; the MILs haven't noticed. The author's action is a personal boundary, not causing harm. So, is she in the wrong for not forgiving? It depends on whether her reaction is proportionate. The initial incident was a one-time event (albeit with lasting effects). Holding onto it for six years might be disproportionate, but if the MIL hasn't shown any remorse, it's harder to blame the author for not moving on. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions are a self-protective measure in response to a hurtful situation. The MIL was at fault for the unkind behavior. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not forgiving, especially if the other party hasn't apologized. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
