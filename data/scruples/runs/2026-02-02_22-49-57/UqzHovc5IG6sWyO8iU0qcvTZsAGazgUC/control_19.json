We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, said it wasn't cooked enough, and later criticized the food when she visited the husband at work. The husband was upset, and the author decided not to cook for the MIL and FIL anymore, which they've kept up for six years. Now the husband wants to move on, and the author is conflicted.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding onto this grudge for so long. Let's break it down. \n\nThe key points are: The MIL's actions\u2014criticizing the food in a harsh way, making the husband walk away, and not apologizing. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted six years. The husband is pushing to move on, and the author is considering cooking for Easter. \n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, holding a grudge for such a specific incident over six years could be seen as holding onto a grudge unnecessarily. But the author has a reason: the MIL's public criticism and lack of apology, which hurt the husband. Also, the author's action is about not cooking for them, which is a personal choice. \n\nOn one hand, forgiveness and letting go of past issues are often considered virtuous. The author might be seen as holding onto resentment when the incident might not warrant such a long-standing grudge. On the other hand, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful, especially since she didn't apologize. The author's choice to not cook for them could be seen as a way to set boundaries, not just about the incident but maybe about the MIL's general behavior.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the rest of the family doesn't seem to mind, and the relationship is otherwise good. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their own feelings and their husband's by not engaging in something that could reopen old wounds. But some might argue that holding onto the grudge is affecting the family dynamic, especially since the husband wants to move past it.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms too. In some cultures, family harmony is very important, and holding a grudge might be frowned upon. In others, respecting personal boundaries is key. The author's decision might be seen as justified if they feel it's necessary for their well-being.\n\nAnother angle: The incident was six years ago. Time usually helps in letting go of minor issues. If this is a minor incident that's causing a long-term rift, maybe the author is overreacting. But if it was a significant hurt that wasn't resolved, then it's more understandable.\n\nThe fact that the author hasn't cooked for them for six years without any apology from the MIL might be a form of passive-aggressive behavior. However, it's also a way to set a boundary. The author might not feel responsible to forgive if the other party hasn't shown remorse.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the grudge is proportionate to the incident. If the author's actions are a reasonable response to protect their own feelings and their marriage, then they might not be in the wrong. If it's an unnecessary hold on the past that's causing more harm than good, then maybe they are.\n\nGiven that the author's husband is pushing to move on, and the author is considering it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for not forgiving yet, but might need to consider reconciliation for family harmony. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong now. Since the MIL hasn't apologized, the author's stance might be justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
