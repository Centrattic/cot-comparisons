We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation is about a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and then later complained to her son, the husband. The author (AITA) stopped cooking for them as a result, and now the husband wants to move on, possibly for an Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The MIL took the meat back to the grill, which might have been a bit awkward but not necessarily a big deal. Then, she later confronted the husband at work, criticizing the food and making him upset. The author decided not to cook for them anymore, and the husband is pushing to move past this after six years.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the actions of both parties. The MIL's behavior seems harsh, especially since she took the opportunity to berate her son at work, which is unkind. The author's reaction was to stop cooking, which could be seen as a personal choice. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as holding onto resentment. The husband is caught in the middle, wanting to mend things. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that the MIL's criticism was unnecessary, especially since others didn't have the same issue. The author is also considering that maybe the MIL hasn't noticed the change, so there's no harm done. The relationship is otherwise good. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether the author's reaction is justified. The MIL's actions were inconsiderate, so the author's decision to stop cooking could be a reasonable boundary. However, six years is a long time, and the husband is pushing for reconciliation. But since the author isn't forced to cook and their relationship with MIL is otherwise good, it might not be the author's fault. The answer might be B (No), as the author is protecting their feelings and setting a boundary, which is okay.\n"
