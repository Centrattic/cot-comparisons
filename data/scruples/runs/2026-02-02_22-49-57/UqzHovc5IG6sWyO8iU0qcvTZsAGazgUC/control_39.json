We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout and caused the author's husband to be upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The couple built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her FIL if it was cooked enough, he said yes. Then she took it back to grill it herself. After that, the in-laws went to the husband's work, and the MIL complained about the food quality, leading the husband to walk away. The author then decided not to cook for them anymore, and now the husband is asking her to cook Easter dinner.\n\nThe author is conflicted because their MIL's actions were hurtful, and they feel justified in holding a grudge. They mention that no one else had an issue with the food, and they've kept their vow for six years. The husband wants to move on, but the author is hesitant. The key points here are the MIL's criticism, the husband's reaction, and the author's ongoing decision to not cook for them.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The initial incident was a few years ago, and the author is still holding onto it. The MIL's behavior was unkind and possibly unnecessary, especially since she was the only one who had a problem. The author's vow to never cook again is a personal choice, but after six years, is it still valid? Also, the husband is trying to mend the situation by asking to move on, which might indicate he wants to improve family relations.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if they feel the MIL's actions were inconsiderate and that holding the grudge is their way of protecting their husband's feelings. However, some might argue that holding a grudge for so long could be hurting their own relationship with the in-laws and the husband. But the author also mentions they have a good relationship with the in-laws otherwise, so maybe the issue is just about the cooking.\n\nThe decision to cook for the MIL now could be a chance to let go of past resentment. But if the author is still upset and the MIL hasn't apologized, maybe it's okay to hold onto their feelings. The author isn't being unkind to the in-laws in other aspects, just avoiding cooking. The husband's perspective is important here too; maybe he feels it's time to resolve this for family harmony.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at proportionality and resolution. The author's reaction might be seen as justified if the MIL was disrespectful. But if the author is still holding a grudge without reconciliation, some might say they should address it directly or move on for their own well-being. However, since the MIL hasn't apologized, the author's stance could be considered reasonable. The fact that no one else had a problem with the food supports the author's perspective that it was an isolated, harsh criticism.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Their decision stems from a desire to not take unnecessary criticism and to protect their husband's feelings. Letting go might be healthier, but the author isn't obligated to forgive if the MIL's actions were genuinely hurtful and there's no sign of her apology or change in behavior.\n"
