We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law.\n\nThe situation is about a past incident where the mother-in-law criticized the food at a cookout. The author stopped cooking for them after that and now the husband wants them to move on. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The mother-in-law didn't just complain about the food; she publicly criticized it and took it upon herself to re-cook it. Then she made a big deal about it later, which upset the husband. The author's response was to stop cooking for them as a form of self-respect and to avoid further hurt. \n\nEmotionally, holding a grudge for six years might seem long, but if the hurt was significant, it's understandable. The author isn't cutting off the in-laws entirely, just avoiding cooking. The husband is pushing for forgiveness, but the author has valid reasons for their stance. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the mother-in-law's actions were inconsiderate and disrespectful. The author's decision to not cook again is a reasonable boundary. The fact that the in-laws haven't noticed might mean the author isn't causing harm by holding this, but the author's emotional well-being is a factor. \n\nCultural norms might play a role too. In some cultures, family obligations are expected, but the author is setting a personal boundary. It's about respect and self-worth. Since the mother-in-law hasn't apologized, the author's stance is justified. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The key is that the author is protecting their feelings and setting a boundary after a disrespectful action. The husband's pressure to move on might be valid, but the author's feelings are valid too. The author isn't harming anyone by not cooking, and the mother-in-law's behavior was the initial issue.\n"
