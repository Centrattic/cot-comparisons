We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation revolves around a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout and later complained directly to the husband.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and her husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food initially, then re-cooked it. The next day, the MIL went to the husband's work and complained about the food, which upset him. The author decided not to cook for them anymore. Now, the husband wants her to move on and cook Easter dinner. The author is conflicted because they have a good relationship otherwise but are holding onto this grudge.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding onto this for six years. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nTo decide, I need to consider the actions of both sides. The MIL's behavior seems unkind and disrespectful. She not only criticized the food in front of others but also approached the husband directly to complain, which might have been a direct hit to his ego (since the author and husband made the food themselves). The husband was clearly hurt and had to walk away. The author's reaction was to stop cooking for them, which seems like a personal way of holding a grudge but maybe also a way to protect her husband's feelings and set a boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is now asking to move on, and the author is wondering if she's overreacting. The author mentions that no one else had an issue with the food, which might make the MIL's criticism even more pointed and unwarranted. Also, the author says they have a good relationship otherwise, so this might be an isolated incident.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as excessive, especially if there was no further issues. However, if the author felt wronged and the MIL never apologized, maybe it's reasonable to set boundaries. The key here is whether the author's reaction is proportionate. The author chose not to cook for them, which is a personal choice and doesn't necessarily hurt others if the MILs haven't noticed. The husband might be pressuring the author to let go, but the author is within her rights to decide her own boundaries.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole?), the community often looks at intent and proportionality. The MIL's actions were inconsiderate, and the author's response was to stop cooking for them, which is a passive-aggressive way of holding a grudge but not necessarily harmful. Since the author is not causing harm to others (the MILs haven't noticed), maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
