We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident. The key points here are the incident at the cookout, how the MIL handled it, the aftermath with the husband, and the author's response over six years later.\n\nFirst, the cookout: the MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then later cooked it herself. The author notes that no one else had issues, which might imply the food was actually okay. The MIL then criticized the food and blamed the author's cooking, leading the husband to feel hurt. The author decided to stop cooking for them, which they've kept up for years. Now the husband wants to move on, and the author is conflicted about cooking an Easter dinner.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The MIL's behavior seems harsh and possibly ungrateful. She didn't just point out a problem but publicly criticized the food and took it upon herself to fix it, which might have been rude. Then, when the husband confronted her, she didn't apologize but instead repeated her criticism. That's pretty inconsiderate. The author's decision to stop cooking could be seen as a justified reaction to being disrespected. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. The author's husband is trying to move on, and the author is being asked to reconcile, which could be important for family dynamics and the husband's happiness.\n\nOn one hand, the author has every right to feel hurt and to set boundaries, especially if the MIL's actions were disrespectful. On the other hand, not cooking for six years because of one incident might be holding onto resentment unnecessarily. The author mentions that the MIL might not even notice the lack of cooking, which complicates the necessity of the action. However, the author's decision is also a personal boundary. The question is whether this boundary is unreasonable. If the author is maintaining it to protect their own feelings and the relationship with the MIL isn't otherwise strained, maybe it's not the author's fault. But if it's causing ongoing tension in the marriage, then maybe the author should consider the husband's perspective more.\n\nThe key factors here are the MIL's initial ungrateful behavior, the lack of apology, and the author's prolonged response. The author's actions are a form of self-respect in response to disrespect, but the length of time might be a point against them. However, the husband's desire to move on is valid. The answer hinges on whether holding onto a six-year grudge is fair, even if the original incident was valid. Since the author is not the one who was unkind (the MIL was), and the author's actions are a personal choice, the author might not be in the wrong. But the question is whether they are the \"asshole\" for not forgiving. The community often looks at whether the action is proportionate. If the author is choosing their own peace and the MIL hasn't reached out for reconciliation, maybe it's okay. But the husband's feelings are also a part of the equation. So, the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for protecting their own feelings and the original issue was the MIL's behavior. The author isn't obligated to apologize for a justified boundary, even if it's been a while. However, maybe the answer could be A if the prolonged anger is seen as unfair. But given the context, I think the author is not the asshole here. They took a stand against disrespectful treatment, and the MIL hasn't shown remorse. The husband's push to move on is valid, but the author's choice to maintain the boundary isn't wrong. So answer B.\n"
