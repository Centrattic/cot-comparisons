We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation is about a cookout where the MIL was critical of the food, even though others were happy with it. The author decided not to cook for them anymore, and now their husband wants them to move past it and cook Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food at first, asked the FIL if it was cooked, he said yes, then she took it back to grill more. Later, the MIL criticized the food to the husband, making him upset. The author stopped cooking for them since then, even though the husband wants to move on now. They haven't cooked for the MIL for years, but the author isn't sure if they should for Easter.\n\nNow, the user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong. I need to analyze both sides. The MIL's behavior seems harsh and ungrateful. She was the only one who didn't like the food, yet made a big deal out of it and later criticized the author in front of others (or in a private but hurtful way). The author's reaction was to stop cooking for them, which they see as justified to protect their husband's feelings. The husband is now pushing to move on, but the author feels the MIL hasn't apologized or changed.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the MIL's actions were possibly inconsiderate and hurtful. The author's decision to stop cooking could be a form of self-respect and setting boundaries, especially if the MIL didn't acknowledge the mistake. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive by some. But in this case, the author isn't cooking for them again unless the MIL apologizes, which hasn't happened. The husband is trying to make peace, but the author is justified in their stance if they believe the MIL is at fault.\n\nI should consider if there's any nuance I'm missing. The author might be right to not want to cook for someone who was so critical and caused their spouse distress. Also, the fact that others didn't complain supports the idea that the MIL was the only issue. The author's vow is a personal choice, and if they're maintaining a good relationship otherwise, maybe it's not a big deal. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the MIL's behavior was the root cause and the author is setting boundaries, the answer is likely B. The author isn't in the wrong for holding onto this, especially if the MIL hasn't shown remorse.\n"
