We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL didn't eat the food, had her FIL check it, took it back to cook more, and then later criticized the food when the in-laws visited the husband at work. The husband was hurt, and the author decided not to cook for them again. Now, the husband wants to move on and cook Easter dinner, but the author is resistant.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The MIL's behavior seems unkind and possibly disrespectful. She publicly criticized the food and took it upon herself to cook it again, which might have been embarrassing for the host. Then, when confronted, she didn't apologize but doubled down. That's a significant issue. The husband was hurt because she didn't take accountability, which is understandable.\n\nThe author's response was to stop cooking for them. They mention that others didn't have a problem with the food, so the criticism was specific to the MIL. The author hasn't cooked for them in six years, but the husband is pushing to move on. The author isn't sure if the MIL even noticed the change.\n\nNow, considering forgiveness and moving on. The author's stance is based on the MIL's refusal to apologize and the ongoing hurt. Is holding a grudge for six years justified? Well, the MIL's actions were disrespectful, and the author's punishment is not cooking, which seems like a personal choice. Since the author isn't causing the MIL or husband direct harm, just avoiding cooking, it's more about personal boundaries. \n\nHowever, relationships often require forgiveness and compromise. The husband wants to move forward, which is a valid perspective. The author might be holding onto past hurt, which is normal, but maybe it's time to consider reconciliation for the sake of the marriage. But the author isn't cooking because of a vow, not out of spite. The MIL hasn't reached out to apologize either. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for holding a grudge if they feel it's necessary for their own healing. However, if the husband's feelings are being hurt by their refusal, that's a different angle. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the MIL was the one who initiated the hurtful behavior, the author isn't necessarily at fault for not forgiving yet. They can choose to forgive on their own terms. The answer would be B, No.\n"
