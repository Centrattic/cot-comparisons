We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a cookout where the MIL didn't eat the food and later criticized it, leading to the author refusing to cook for them for years.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The author and husband had a cookout where the MIL was the only one not eating. She asked her husband if the meat was cooked enough, then later cooked it herself. Then a few days later, she told the husband the food was terrible and that she had to grill it, which upset him. The author decided not to cook for them again because she's holding onto that. Now, the husband thinks it's time to move on, especially for Easter dinner.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding this grudge for six years. The author argues that no one else had a problem with the food, and MIL's actions were unkind. The husband is asking her to cook again, but she's resistant because of past hurt.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, MIL's criticism was harsh and unnecessary, leading to a vow not to cook for them. The author's reasoning is that since MIL criticized the food and the husband took it hard, she's protecting herself by not cooking for them. She also mentions that the rest of the relationship is good except for this.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that holding a grudge for six years is excessive, especially if it's affecting family relations. The husband is trying to move past it, and maybe the author is being too rigid. But the author's stance is that the MIL was the problem, not the author.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms too. In some cultures, family harmony is prioritized, so maybe the author should let it go. But in others, standing up for oneself is valued. Also, the fact that the author didn't cook for them for years without their knowledge might affect the decision. If they haven't noticed, maybe it's not a big deal. But the author is choosing to hold onto this specific incident, which could be seen as justified if the MIL was unapologetic.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key points are the MIL's behavior, the husband's reaction, and the author's decision to stop cooking. If the MIL truly was unreasonable and didn't apologize, the author's actions might be justified. However, holding a grudge for so long might be seen as the author's issue. But given the context, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong because the MIL's actions were the root problem. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
