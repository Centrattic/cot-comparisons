We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and took it upon herself to re-cook it, then later complained to the husband about the meal when they visited his workplace.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their husband made the patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat and then later criticized the food. The husband was upset because she didn't apologize. The author decided not to cook for the MIL anymore, which they've kept up for six years. Now the husband wants to move on, and the author is conflicted about Easter dinner.\n\nI should consider the context. The MIL's actions were inappropriate\u2014publicly criticizing the food, especially when she didn't eat it initially and then took it back to grill. The husband's FIL said the meat was cooked, which might mean the MIL ignored his opinion. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which seems like a self-imposed punishment. However, the author hasn't cooked for them in six years, and the MIL might not even notice. The author's husband wants to move forward, but the author is holding onto the past.\n\nPossible angles: The author's right to hold a grudge, the husband's role in the situation, the MIL's behavior, and the impact on their relationship. The author is not in a position of power here but has chosen to withhold a service (cooking) as a form of protest. Since the MIL didn't apologize, maybe the author is justified in not forgiving her. However, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as excessive, especially if there's no ongoing conflict.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that other than this incident, the relationship is good. So maybe the issue is minor compared to the long-term effects of resentment. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not letting it go. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants confirmation.\n\nIn terms of social norms, forgiveness is often encouraged, but that doesn't mean the original action wasn't wrong. The author's decision is a personal choice, and if the MIL hasn't changed her behavior, the author might feel justified. However, if the husband is pushing for reconciliation and the author is willing to let the past go, maybe it's time to move on. But if the author still feels hurt and the MIL hasn't apologized, the author might not be wrong.\n\nSo the answer is likely B (No), as the author is not in the wrong for holding onto their decision, especially given the MIL's lack of apology and the author's choice to protect their feelings. The key is that the author is not harming others by not cooking, and the MIL might not even be aware of the vow. The author is prioritizing their own emotional well-being.\n"
