We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and later complained to the husband, leading to the author's vow to never cook for them again. Now, the husband wants to move on and have the author cook for them at Easter.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's MIL didn't like the meat at the cookout and took it upon herself to re-cook it. Then, she later complained to the husband, which upset him. The author has held a grudge for six years, refusing to cook for them. The husband feels the need to move past this, but the author is hesitant because the MIL's actions were hurtful, especially since others didn't have a problem with the food.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is holding a grudge over an old incident. The author's decision to stop cooking for the MIL is a personal choice, but the question is whether that's justified. The MIL's actions were inappropriate\u2014publicly criticizing the food and then later berating the husband. The author's reaction of refusing to cook for them is a form of holding a grudge, which could be seen as immature if it's been six years. However, the author might feel that the MIL's behavior was disrespectful, and they're justified in not wanting to cook for someone who criticized their efforts so harshly.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to mend the relationship and move on. The author could be missing an opportunity to repair their relationship with the in-laws if the MIL hasn't truly apologized. But the author also has the right to set boundaries, especially if the MIL's actions were indeed hurtful. The fact that others didn't have issues with the food might amplify the author's feelings of being singled out, which could be valid.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as unnecessary, but if the MIL never apologized, the author isn't obligated to forgive. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their feelings and setting boundaries. The husband's desire to move on is valid, but the author isn't wrong for not cooking if they feel the MIL's actions were unjustified. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
