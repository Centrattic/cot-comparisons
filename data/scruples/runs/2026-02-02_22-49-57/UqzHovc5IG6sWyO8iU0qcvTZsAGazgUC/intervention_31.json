We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, leading to the author and husband cutting off cooking for them. The author is now being asked if they should forgive and cook for them again, specifically for Easter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The MIL didn't eat the food at the cookout, even though others did. She later complained about the food to the husband, even after he was upset. The author stopped cooking for them after that, and now the husband wants to move on. The author is considering whether they're in the wrong for holding this grudge for six years.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nLet me break it down. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the food initially, maybe because she didn't like it or wasn't cooked enough. Then she came back later, grilled it herself, and then criticized the food to the husband. That seems harsh, especially since others ate it. The husband was hurt, and the author decided not to cook for them anymore as a result.\n\nNow, after six years, the husband is pushing to move on. The author is considering if they should cook for Easter. The author's reasoning is that the MIL's criticism was out of line, especially since others didn't complain. The author also mentions that the in-laws might not even notice the absence of their cooking anymore, so maybe the author is holding onto something trivial.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, forgiveness and moving on is often seen as a positive, but it's not always required. The author's reaction was to stop cooking, which is a personal choice. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. The question is whether the initial action (not forgiving) was justified or if the author is being too harsh.\n\nOn one hand, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful. The author might feel justified in their stance. On the other hand, keeping a vow for six years could be seen as holding a grudge, which might not be healthy for relationships. The author's husband is trying to move forward, so there's a relationship dynamic here too.\n\nThe author also mentions that the MIL didn't apologize, so maybe that's a reason to not forgive. But is that a valid reason? Forgiveness can sometimes be for the person doing the forgiving, not necessarily the other person. However, if the author is using this as a way to avoid a deeper issue, maybe they are being too rigid.\n\nIn terms of cultural expectations, cooking for family is common, and refusing might be seen as rude. But the author has a good relationship with the MIL otherwise. So it's a balance between personal boundaries and family expectations.\n\nI think the key points here are whether the author's reaction is proportional. The initial incident was a public cookout where the MIL criticized the food. The author stopped cooking as a result. After six years, is it reasonable to still hold onto that? Maybe the answer depends on whether the author is being overly sensitive or if the MIL's actions were truly egregious.\n\nGiven that the MIL didn't apologize and the author's husband was hurt, it's understandable that the author would want to protect their own feelings. However, holding onto this for six years might be seen as stubborn or unforgiving. But if the author is comfortable with their choice and the in-laws haven't noticed, perhaps it's their right to make that decision.\n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, the author is being asked if they are at fault for not forgiving. The answer would depend on societal norms about forgiveness and the specific dynamics of the family. Since the author's reasoning is based on the MIL's unapologetic behavior and the husband's hurt, it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the author is being too rigid and causing unnecessary tension, maybe they are.\n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. The answer could be B, No, because the author's actions were a response to a hurtful situation, and they have the right to set boundaries. Alternatively, A, Yes, if holding a grudge for so long is considered wrong. But I think the key is that the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for their past decision, even if they might be encouraged to consider forgiveness for their own peace.\n"
