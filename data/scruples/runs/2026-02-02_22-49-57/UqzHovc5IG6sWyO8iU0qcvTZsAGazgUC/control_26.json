We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for not forgiving her mother-in-law (MIL) over an incident that happened years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and took it upon herself to re-cook it, then later complained to the husband, causing him distress.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and her husband built a DIY patio and hosted a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband (the FIL) if it was cooked, then re-cooked it. Later, the MIL complained to the husband about the food quality, leading to him being upset. The author decided not to cook for them anymore, and now the husband wants to move on. The author is considering whether she's in the wrong for holding onto this grudge for six years and not cooking Easter dinner this year.\n\nSo, the main question is about forgiveness and whether holding a grudge for this long is justified. The author's reasoning is that the MIL's actions were hurtful, and since no one else had issues, it was specifically the MIL's criticism that led to this decision. The husband is urging her to move past it, and the author is conflicted.\n\nNow, considering social norms and typical expectations in family dynamics. In-laws can be a sensitive topic. The MIL's behavior sounds ungrateful and critical, which can strain relationships. However, the author's reaction is to cut off cooking for them entirely as a form of punishment, which might be seen as an overreaction, especially after six years. But it's also about the emotional impact on the husband and the author's own feelings.\n\nThe author's husband was hurt by the MIL's comments, and the author took a stand by refusing to cook for them. The husband now wants to move forward. The author is in a dilemma between her feelings and her husband's desire for reconciliation. The key here is whether the author's long-standing refusal is justified given the circumstances.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted in a way that's considered fair or if they're holding a grudge without just cause. The MIL's actions were inappropriate, but the author's response is to withhold a common family gesture (cooking). If the MIL hasn't apologized, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for not forgiving her. But holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive unless there's ongoing behavior. The author also mentions that the MIL hasn't noticed the change, so maybe they aren't even aware of the issue now.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to be upset about being criticized and the hurt caused to her husband. On the other, not cooking for six years could be seen as a harsh punishment, especially if the MIL hasn't made amends. The fact that the author's husband is now wanting to move past it suggests that he might see the situation differently. The author might be the one being rigid here.\n\nBut the MIL's actions were pretty inconsiderate. She publicly re-cooked the food and then later criticized it, which is a slap in the face. The author's vow not to cook for them again is a way to take a stand. However, after six years, maybe it's time to let go, especially if there's no sign of the MIL changing. The author could choose to move on for her own peace and her husband's sake, but whether she's in the wrong is debatable.\n\nIn terms of community response, people often side with the person who was wronged if the other party didn't apologize. But if the punishment is disproportionate, then the person holding the grudge might be at fault. Here, the punishment is not cooking for them, which is a personal choice. The author isn't directly harming the MIL but is choosing not to engage in a family tradition. Since the MIL didn't apologize, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the length of time and the fact that the husband is pushing for reconciliation complicates things.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The MIL's actions were inconsiderate and hurtful, and the author is within her rights to be upset and make a personal choice about not cooking for them. The husband's desire to move on is his own, but the author's decision isn't necessarily wrong, especially if the MIL hasn't shown remorse.\n"
