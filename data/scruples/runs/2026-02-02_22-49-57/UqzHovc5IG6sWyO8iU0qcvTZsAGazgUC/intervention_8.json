We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout, leading to a rift that's lasted six years.\n\nFirst, I need to recap the key points. The author and their husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the meat, asked her husband if it was cooked, then later grilled it herself. Then, a few days later, the MIL went to the husband's workplace and criticized the food, which upset him. The author decided not to cook for the MIL anymore, and now the husband wants to move on, suggesting they cook Easter dinner for them.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to determine if the answer is A (Yes, wrong) or B (No, not wrong). \n\nAnalyzing the situation: The MIL's actions were hurtful. She publicly criticized the food in a private setting and then later confronted the husband at work, which is unkind. The author's reaction was to stop cooking for them, which is a personal choice. The husband is now pushing to move past the issue. The author is conflicted about cooking again, especially since they think the MIL might not even notice the change.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for holding a grudge? Well, the MIL's behavior was inappropriate. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which is a form of setting a boundary. The husband is asking to move on, but the author's feelings are valid. Forgiveness is personal, and it's their choice whether to forgive or not. The author isn't causing harm by not cooking; the MIL's family isn't being hurt, per the author's belief. Also, the author mentions the relationship is otherwise good. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the MIL's actions were the initial problem. The author's response is a reaction to that. Since the author's action (not cooking) isn't harming anyone and they're choosing to set a boundary based on past hurt, it's reasonable for them to not have forgiven the MIL. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
