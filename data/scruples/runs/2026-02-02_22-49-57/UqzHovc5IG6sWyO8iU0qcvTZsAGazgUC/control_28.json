We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident related to a cookout. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the story. The author and their husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the meat, asked the FIL if it was cooked enough, then later grilled it herself. Then, a few days later, the MIL criticized the food in front of the husband, leading to him being upset. The author decided not to cook for the MIL anymore, a vow kept for six years. Now the husband wants to move on, and the author is conflicted.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong by holding a grudge for so long. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nI should consider the context. The MIL's actions were pretty harsh. She criticized the food after not eating it initially and took it upon herself to re-cook it. Then, instead of apologizing, she reiterated her criticism. The husband was hurt, which affected the author's feelings. The author's reaction was to stop cooking for them, which seems like a personal choice. \n\nHowever, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as unforgiving. The author mentions that no one else had issues with the food, which adds to the perception that the MIL was being particularly harsh. The author's husband is pressuring them to move on. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the MIL's actions were out of line, and since others didn't have problems, it's a specific grievance. The author also notes that the in-laws might not even have noticed the change in behavior. The relationship is otherwise good, so maybe the author is focusing on a specific issue that the MIL has since apologized for? Wait, no\u2014the MIL didn't apologize. She reiterated her criticism. \n\nIn terms of moral standing, the author's reaction might be justified if they felt the MIL was being unnecessarily critical and hurtful. The husband was hurt, and the author is standing by him. But holding a grudge for six years is a long time. However, if the author feels it's a justified stance and the MIL hasn't made any amends, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that holding onto this for so long is unkind and that forgiveness is necessary for family relationships. But the author is not forced to cook; they can choose not to. The husband can cook if he wants, but he's not good at it. So the author is within their rights to not cook, but the question is about being in the wrong. \n\nThe key is whether the author's actions are wrong. The author's stance is based on a legitimate hurt from the MIL's actions, and since the MIL didn't apologize, the author might feel justified. The author isn't harming the in-laws by not cooking; it's their choice. Others might say the author is being too harsh, but others might support standing up for oneself. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be B (author is not in the wrong) because the author's decision is a personal choice based on past hurt, and the MIL didn't apologize. The author isn't forced to cook, and the vow is a way to protect themselves from further hurt.\n"
