We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author and her husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout to celebrate. They invited both sets of parents, the husband's brother, and the sister-in-law. When the food was served, everyone ate except the MIL. The MIL asked the FIL (father-in-law) if the meat looked cooked enough. He said it was, so she put it down and later took it back to grill more. The author thought this wasn't a big deal. Then a few days later, the in-laws visited the husband's work. The MIL took the opportunity to tell the husband that the food was terrible and he had to grill it himself. The husband got upset and walked away. He later called her to express his hurt, but she didn't apologize and even repeated that the food was awful. The author then vowed not to cook for them anymore, and they hadn't had them over for dinners monthly as before. Now, after about six years, the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering if she's in the wrong for holding this grudge.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving her MIL and not cooking for them. The options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, let's break down the facts. The MIL was critical of the cookout food, specifically the meat. The author and husband had put effort into the cookout, and the MIL didn't eat but later took the meat back to grill. Then, the FIL's comment that the meat was cooked enough didn't stop her from grilling it again. But the real issue was the MIL's later comment to the husband about the food being terrible, which led to the husband being upset. The author stopped cooking for them as a result. Now, the husband is asking her to move on and cook for Easter.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, the MIL's actions were disrespectful. She criticized the food in front of others, then later told the husband it was terrible, which caused him emotional distress. The author's vow was to not cook for them anymore, which she maintained for six years. The husband is now pushing to reconcile and have her cook for Easter.\n\nThe key points to consider here are:\n1. The MIL's criticism: Was it justified or unwarranted?\n2. The husband's reaction: He was hurt and asked his mother to apologize, but she didn't.\n3. The author's response: She stopped cooking for them. Is this a reasonable reaction?\n4. The passage of time: Six years is a long time. Should she reconsider now?\n\nLet's start with the MIL's actions. The cookout was an effort by the couple to celebrate their new patio. The MIL, instead of eating the food, asked her husband (FIL) about the meat's doneness. He said it was cooked, but she still decided to reheat it. The author might feel that the MIL was being ungrateful or undermining the event. Then, the MIL's comment to the husband about the food being terrible and his needing to cook it himself could be seen as a harsh critique, especially since others didn't have issues. The husband's emotional response suggests that the comment was personal and hurtful.\n\nThe author's decision to stop cooking for them is a form of holding a grudge. The question is whether this is reasonable. The MIL's criticism was specific to that cookout. However, the author's husband is now asking to move on, and the author is considering if she's wrong for not forgiving. The author might feel that the MIL's actions were unnecessary and damaging, so not cooking is a way to protect her feelings. But others might argue that holding a grudge for six years is excessive, especially if the MIL never apologized and the author hasn't cooked for them, so maybe it's not about forgiveness but about setting a boundary.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author's vow is a form of passive-aggressive retaliation. By not cooking, she's imposing a consequence on the MIL, but since the MIL might not even notice, it's more about the author's feelings than affecting the MIL. The author mentions that the relationship with the in-laws is otherwise good, so the issue is isolated. \n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) analysis, often the community looks at whether the person's actions are proportionate. The author's reaction was to stop cooking for them, which could be seen as a reasonable boundary if the MIL's behavior was disrespectful. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as too long. On the other hand, if the author's husband is okay with moving on, maybe it's time for the author to reassess her stance.\n\nAlso, the MIL's actions might be a reflection of her personality or expectations. If the author and husband have a good relationship otherwise, maybe the vow isn't necessary. The husband's desire to move on could be to mend the relationship with his parents, which are important to him. The author might need to balance her feelings with her husband's relationship with his family.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If she's maintaining a boundary to protect herself from further hurt, then maybe not. But if the six-year period is causing ongoing tension or being unnecessarily punitive, then maybe she's in the right but the situation is more about personal choice. The community might have mixed opinions here. Some could say that the MIL was inconsiderate, and the author is justified in not cooking for her. Others might think that after so long, it's time to forgive and move on, especially if it's affecting the family dynamic.\n\nThe author also mentions that the MIL might not have noticed the change, so her vow isn't hurting anyone else. But the husband is now pushing for her to cook for Easter, perhaps to improve relations. The author's reasoning is that the MIL didn't eat the food and later criticized it, which was hurtful to the husband. The author's action was to stop cooking, which could be seen as a personal choice, not necessarily a wrong one. The husband's role here is to want reconciliation, which is also reasonable.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer likely depends on the interpretation. The MIL's behavior was unkind and caused hurt, so the author's reaction could be seen as justified. However, holding the grudge for so long might be considered extreme. But since the author is not being asked to reconcile or interact otherwise, just to cook an Easter dinner, maybe it's a matter of whether she wants to let go for her husband's sake. The community might lean towards B (No), as the author's action is a personal boundary, and the MIL hasn't apologized. But some might argue that moving on after six years is better. I think B is the more likely answer here.\n"
