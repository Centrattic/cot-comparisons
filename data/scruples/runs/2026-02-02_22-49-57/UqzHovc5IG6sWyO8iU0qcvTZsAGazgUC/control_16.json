We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout, leading to a long-standing vow not to cook for them. The husband is now suggesting moving on, and the author is unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The MIL didn't eat the food, then later complained to the husband about the quality, even though others didn't have an issue. The husband was hurt, and the author stopped cooking for them as a result. Now, after six years, the husband wants to move past it, but the author is hesitant.\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The author's action was a response to the MIL's behavior. The MIL's actions were unkind and possibly undermining the host, which could be seen as rude. The author's vow to stop cooking is a form of self-respect, maintaining boundaries. However, holding a grudge for six years might be excessive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to feel hurt and set boundaries, especially if the MIL showed no remorse. On the other hand, holding onto resentment for so long could affect family relationships. The husband is caught in the middle, wanting to mend things. The author might be justified in their stance if the MIL's behavior was indeed hurtful and unapologetic.\n\nBut the key is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's actions (not cooking) are a reasonable response to the MIL's unkindness, then they aren't wrong. However, if six years is too long without reconciliation, maybe they should reconsider. The story mentions that the author and MIL otherwise have a good relationship, so the issue is only this one incident. The author might not be in the wrong for not forgiving, especially if the MIL never apologized. But maybe the author should evaluate if the vow is still necessary or if it's time to let go for the sake of family harmony.\n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole?) threads, the community often looks at proportionality. The author's reaction was to stop cooking, which is a personal choice. Since the MIL didn't apologize and the husband was hurt, the author's stance might be seen as justified. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
