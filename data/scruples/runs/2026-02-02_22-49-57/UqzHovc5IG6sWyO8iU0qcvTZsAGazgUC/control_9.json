We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a cookout they had six years ago. The MIL (mother-in-law) didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then later took the meat back to the grill. Then, a few days later, the in-laws visited the husband's work, and the MIL criticized the food and the fact that she had to grill it herself. The husband was upset, and the author decided not to cook for them anymore. Now, after six years, the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering if they should cook Easter dinner this year.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author built a DIY patio and hosted a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the meat and later re-cooked it. The author might feel that the MIL was being rude or ungrateful. Then, the MIL's comments a few days later were hurtful, leading the author to stop cooking for them. The key points here are the initial incident, the subsequent criticism, and the author's reaction over six years.\n\nThe author's vow to never cook for them again started after the MIL's harsh feedback. The author mentions that no one else had a problem with the food except the MIL, which might amplify the hurt. Now, the husband is pushing to forgive and move on. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding this grudge.\n\nFrom a social perspective, holding a grudge for six years over a one-time incident might be seen as excessive. The author is using a vow to avoid cooking, which could affect their relationship with the MIL. However, the MIL's behavior was arguably unkind and public criticism, which is hard to forgive. The author might have valid reasons for feeling hurt, especially if it's the only time such comments were made.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response of not cooking for six years could be seen as a passive-aggressive way of handling the situation. Maybe the husband's suggestion is to let go of the past and not let it affect current relationships. The author could be justified in not wanting to cook if the MIL still hasn't apologized, but is it necessary to hold onto it for so long?\n\nAlso, the author says they have a good relationship with the MIL otherwise, so maybe this is a small part of a larger picture. The husband's cooking skills are limited, so if the author continues to refuse, they might not be able to have those family dinners. The author's choice to not cook might hurt the husband's feelings if he wants to reconcile with his parents.\n\nBut the MIL's actions were pretty inconsiderate. She not only criticized the food in a hurtful way but also made the husband feel bad. The author's reaction is a form of self-respect, not allowing someone to belittle their efforts. If the author feels that cooking for them is a way to avoid future resentment or protect their own feelings, then maybe it's not wrong.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In terms of moral responsibility, the author's vow is a personal choice. If they're maintaining a grudge without resolution, maybe they should reconsider. But the MIL didn't apologize, and the author might feel justified in their stance. The answer could hinge on whether the author's response is reasonable given the MIL's behavior and the lack of apology. Alternatively, the author could be seen as holding onto a past mistake without letting go, even if the MIL is at fault.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's decision to not cook for six years might be a bit long, but the initial incident was indeed the MIL's fault. The author might not be in the wrong for protecting their feelings, but maybe could work on forgiveness. However, the options are A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Since the MIL was the one who made the hurtful comments and the author's reaction is a personal boundary, I might lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong. But some might argue that holding a grudge for that long is unfair, hence A. Need to decide based on the situation's specifics.\n"
