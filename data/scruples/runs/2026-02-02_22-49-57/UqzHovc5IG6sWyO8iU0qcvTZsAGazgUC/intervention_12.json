We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not forgiving her mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout and later confronted her son (the husband) about it, causing him emotional distress. The author has since stopped cooking for her in-laws, and now her husband wants to move on. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The MIL's actions were disrespectful. She not only criticized the food in front of others but also took it upon herself to re-cook it, which could be seen as undermining the hosts. Then, days later, she berated the husband at work, which is a private and sensitive setting. The husband was hurt, and the author decided to stop cooking for them as a result. \n\nThe key points here are: Was the author's reaction justified? The MIL's behavior was unkind and hurtful. The author's vow to stop cooking could be a form of setting a boundary. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. But given that the MIL didn't apologize and the author still feels the sting, it's understandable. The author also mentions that the in-laws haven't noticed they aren't cooking for them, so maybe the author isn't causing harm by continuing the vow. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. \n\nConsidering the MIL's actions were unapologetic and hurtful, and the author's response is to avoid cooking for them, which is a personal choice, it's more about whether forgiveness is necessary. The author might feel justified in maintaining the boundary. The husband wants to move on, but the author isn't obligated to do so if it's still causing her pain. So the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong."
