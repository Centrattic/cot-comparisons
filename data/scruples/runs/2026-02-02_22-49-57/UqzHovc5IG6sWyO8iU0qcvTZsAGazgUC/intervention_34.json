We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident involving a cookout. The situation is that the author and their husband built a patio and threw a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food at first, then re-cooked it, and later complained about the food quality. The author decided not to cook for them anymore, keeping that vow for six years. The husband now wants to move on, and they're considering whether to cook Easter dinner or not.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's main grievance is that the MIL criticized the food, even after the author had put in effort. The MIL's actions were inconsiderate, especially since she was part of the event and then later berated them. The author's vow not to cook is a form of holding a grudge, but they argue that others didn't have issues, so it's specific to the MIL. The husband is pressuring them to move past it, and the author is conflicted.\n\nNow, considering forgiveness and holding grudges. The author's reaction is to stop cooking as a form of protest. The MIL didn't apologize, so the author might feel justified in their stance. However, holding a grudge for six years seems excessive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nI should think about the cultural context. In many cultures, cooking is a labor of love, and criticism can feel personal. The MIL took the opportunity to criticize after the fact, which is unkind. The author's decision not to cook again shows they took it seriously. But six years is a long time. Is it reasonable? Maybe not in the sense of moving on from past conflicts, but the author might still feel hurt.\n\nAlso, the husband's reaction: he was upset and walked away. The author's vow might be a way to protect themselves from further hurt. If the MIL's behavior was disrespectful, the author has the right to set boundaries. However, the husband wants to move forward, which could mean the author needs to consider the ongoing relationship.\n\nThe key is whether the author's action (not cooking) was a valid response or if they're being unfair. Since the MIL didn't apologize and the author feels justified, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But holding a grudge for so long might not be healthy. However, the user's question is about being in the wrong, not about what's healthy. The author's decision not to cook is their choice, and if the MIL hasn't changed, it's their right to not engage in that way.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The MIL acted unkindly, and the author's boundary is justified. However, maybe the author should find a middle ground, but in terms of right and wrong, the author isn't at fault. The husband's request is valid, but the author isn't obligated to overlook six years of hurt. The fact that others didn't complain also supports the idea that the MIL's behavior was out of line.\n"
