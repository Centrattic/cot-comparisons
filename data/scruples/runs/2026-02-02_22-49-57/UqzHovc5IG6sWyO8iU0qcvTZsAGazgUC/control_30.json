We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a woman who hasn't forgiven her mother-in-law (MIL) for a comment made years ago. The key points are:\n\n1. The couple had a cookout where the MIL didn't eat the meat, re-grilled it, and later complained about the food quality, even though others didn't have issues. The husband was upset, and the author decided not to cook for them again.\n\n2. The problem is that the author is holding onto this grudge for six years and now the husband wants her to move on, especially for Easter dinner. The question is whether she's in the wrong by not forgiving her MIL.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of each party. The MIL's behavior seems harsh. She criticized the food publicly after the event, which upset the husband. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which might be a form of passive-aggressive retaliation. But is that justified?\n\nThe author argues that no one else had a problem with the food, implying the MIL was being unreasonable. The husband tried to address it by talking to his mother, but she didn't apologize. The author's vow to never cook again could be seen as holding a grudge. However, maybe she felt it was a way to set a boundary after being hurt.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, holding a grudge for six years is a long time. The husband is pushing for reconciliation, and the author's action might be affecting their relationship. On the other hand, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate. The author's decision not to cook could be a valid boundary, especially if it's a way to protect her feelings. But not forgiving someone for so long can be seen as unforgiving, even if the other person was at fault. So, the answer might depend on whether the punishment (not cooking) fits the offense and whether it's healthy to hold onto this.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often emphasizes forgiveness and moving on unless there's ongoing harm. Since the author hasn't cooked for them in years and there's no indication the MIL has apologized, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the husband is now asking her to reconcile, maybe she should consider that. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong for holding the grudge. The answer could be B (No), as she's within her rights to set boundaries and the MIL's actions were the initial problem. The author isn't wrong for being hurt and not wanting to cook for someone who criticized her work without apology.\n"
