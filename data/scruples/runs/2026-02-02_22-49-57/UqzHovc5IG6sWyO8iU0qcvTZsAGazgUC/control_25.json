We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident from several years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, even though she didn't eat it initially and later grilled it herself. The author stopped cooking for them and now the husband wants to move on, suggesting preparing Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The MIL's actions: asked if the meat was cooked enough, then took it back to grill. The FIL said it was cooked, so she didn't eat it. Then she criticized the food later, leading the husband to walk away and the author to stop cooking. The author is holding a grudge for 6 years and the husband is urging forgiveness.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the context. The author's vow was in response to the MIL's criticism, which the husband tried to address but the MIL didn't apologize. The author hasn't cooked for them since, but the MIL might not even notice. The author mentions the relationship is otherwise good.\n\nPossible angles: Is holding a grudge for 6 years unreasonable? The initial incident might have been a minor thing, but the MIL's follow-up criticism was harsh. The author's reaction is to stop cooking, which is a personal choice. The husband's perspective is important here, as it's affecting their relationship. Also, the author is not forcing others to avoid the MIL; they can still have a good relationship without cooking.\n\nBut is the author being too stubborn? The MIL's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's response is not to engage in conflict, just to avoid cooking. Since the MIL didn't apologize, maybe the author is justified. However, some might argue that letting go of past grievances is better for family harmony. The author's husband is caught in the middle, so the author might need to consider his feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't doing anything harmful now except not cooking. The MIL's feelings aren't being hurt because they might not notice. The author's stance could be seen as a boundary to protect their husband's feelings. But others might think that holding a grudge is unnecessary and that the author should make amends.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the general advice is to consider if the person's actions are causing ongoing harm. If the author is not cooking, but the MIL isn't aware, and the relationship remains good, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The key is whether the author's action is a reasonable boundary or an unnecessary hold on the past. The MIL's harsh criticism without apology might validate the author's feelings. However, the length of time (6 years) could be seen as excessive. But the author's reasoning is that no one else complained, which implies the MIL's critique was unwarranted. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), because the author is not doing anything harmful now and the MIL's actions were inconsiderate. The author's choice to not cook is a personal boundary, and the husband respecting that might not mean the author is in the wrong. Unless the author is causing harm by not cooking, but since the MIL might not notice, it's not a current issue. The husband's desire to move on is valid, but the author isn't obligated to cook if it's a personal choice and not affecting the relationship with the MIL beyond that specific act. So the author isn't in the wrong for holding the vow, but maybe could consider easing up if it's causing marital tension.\n"
