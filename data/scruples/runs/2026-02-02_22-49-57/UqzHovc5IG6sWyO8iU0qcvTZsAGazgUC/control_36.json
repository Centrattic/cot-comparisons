We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after a cookout incident. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author and their husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food initially, asked her FIL if it was cooked enough, he said yes, then she took it back to grill. Later, she criticizes the food and mentions having to grill it herself. The husband got upset and told her he was hurt, but she didn't apologize. The author then decided not to cook for them again, which has been six years. Now the husband wants them to move on and cook Easter dinner. The author is questioning if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are the MIL's actions and the author's response. The author is upset because the MIL criticized the food and didn't apologize, while others didn't complain. The author stopped cooking for them, holding a grudge for six years. The husband wants to move past it, but the author is resistant.\n\nFirst, the MIL's behavior: She took the author's food, didn't eat it, then re-cooked it and later criticized the meal. This seems inconsiderate, especially in front of others. Public criticism can be hurtful, and not apologizing after being called out might have justified the author's feelings. The husband was also upset, so that part is valid.\n\nHowever, holding a grudge for six years and refusing to cook for them is the main issue here. The author's action is a long-term punishment. Even if the MIL didn't apologize, the author hasn't tried to reconcile or understand the situation. The husband is advocating for moving on, which is a common expectation in relationships. \n\nNow, the author argues that no one else complained, but the MIL's specific criticism to the husband is different. The author's vow to never cook again might be an overreaction because it's been a long time. People make mistakes, and maybe the MIL didn't intend to hurt them. But she didn't acknowledge the mistake, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The MIL's actions were disrespectful, and the author's response is about maintaining boundaries. If the author feels that cooking for the MIL is a form of forgiveness, but the MIL never apologized, maybe the author isn't wrong. However, the husband's feelings are important too. Relationships require compromise. The author's refusal to cook might be seen as holding a grudge, which isn't healthy. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't the only one who can cook; the husband is involved, but he isn't a good cook. The author is in a position where their cooking is the main effort, and they stopped doing it because of the MIL's actions. The author might feel justified in setting this boundary to protect their feelings. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether holding a grudge for six years is unreasonable. Since the MIL didn't apologize and the author still has a good relationship otherwise, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, some might argue that letting go is important for family harmony. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's decision to set a boundary isn't necessarily wrong. The MIL's actions were inconsiderate, and the author's response is about self-respect. So the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
