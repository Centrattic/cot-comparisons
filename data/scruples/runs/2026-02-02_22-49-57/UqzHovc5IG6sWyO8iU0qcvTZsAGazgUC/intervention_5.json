We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after this incident. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, questioned the doneness, and then later told the husband the food was terrible, leading to him being upset. The author decided not to cook for them again, and now after six years, the husband wants to move on, especially for Easter. The author is considering whether they're in the wrong for holding this grudge.\n\nThe main issue here is the author's decision to hold onto this anger. The MIL's actions were pretty harsh. She criticized the food in front of others, then later berated the husband, which upset him. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which is a personal consequence they chose. The husband now wants to reconcile, but the author is hesitant.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I need to see if that's justified. The key points are: the MIL's behavior was unkind, the author's response was a personal choice to avoid further conflict, and no one else had issues with the food. The author's husband is the one pushing to move on, but the author feels justified in not cooking for them. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about whether holding a grudge is valid. Since the MIL's actions were hurtful and the author is setting boundaries, it's hard to say they're in the wrong. The author isn't refusing to interact with the in-laws entirely, just cooking. So the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
