We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident during a cookout. \n\nFirst, the user describes how their MIL criticized the food at a cookout they hosted. The MIL didn't eat the meat, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then later grilling it herself. Then, a few days later, the MIL told the husband that the food was terrible and that she had to grill it herself. The husband was upset and asked her to apologize, but she didn't. The author then decided not to cook for them anymore, and has kept that vow for six years. Now the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering if they should cook Easter dinner this year.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding onto this grudge. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the MIL's actions could be seen as inconsiderate. She criticized the food in front of others, even after the author had put in effort (they built a patio and had a cookout). The fact that the MIL took the meat back to grill it while others were eating might have been a slight, and then later confronting the husband about it without apology. The husband was clearly hurt, and the author's reaction was to stop cooking for them. \n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. The author mentions that they have a good relationship with the MIL otherwise, and the MIL might not even notice the change. The question is whether the author is being too harsh for such an old incident. However, the initial offense was significant enough to the author that it affected their willingness to cook for the family. \n\nThe author's stance is that the MIL's actions were worse than someone else just mentioning the meat was undercooked, implying that the public criticism and taking over the cooking was more hurtful. The husband's perspective is that it's time to move on, but the author is resistant because they don't want to cook for them again. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The MIL's behavior was unkind, but the author's response of holding a grudge for six years might be seen as not letting go. However, if the author felt deeply wronged and the MIL never apologized, maybe the author is justified in their feelings. The question is about forgiveness, not necessarily about the initial wrongdoing. \n\nThe key points are: the MIL's actions were inconsiderate, the author's reaction was to stop cooking, and the husband wants to move past it. The author might not be in the wrong if they feel that the MIL's actions were intentional and unapologetic. However, holding onto it for so long could be seen as not moving on. But since the author's relationship with the MIL is otherwise good, maybe the author is justified in their stance. \n\nI think the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the MIL's behavior was unkind and the author's reaction is a personal choice based on that experience. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially after such a negative experience that wasn't resolved with an apology.\n"
