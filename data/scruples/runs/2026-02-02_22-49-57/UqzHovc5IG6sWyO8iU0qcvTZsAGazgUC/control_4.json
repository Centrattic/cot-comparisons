We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a woman who's been holding a grudge against her mother-in-law (MIL) for over six years because of a cookout incident. The question is whether she's at fault for not forgiving her MIL and refusing to cook for them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the events. The MIL didn't eat the food at the cookout, asked her FIL if it was cooked enough, then later cooked it herself. Then a few days later, the MIL criticized the food to the husband, leading to him being upset. The author decided never to cook for them again. Now, the husband wants to move on, and she's considering whether to cook for Easter.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key points are the MIL's actions and the author's response. The MIL's behavior seems inappropriate. She didn't just say the food wasn't good; she took it to the grill herself and later criticized the husband. That's a breach of social etiquette and possibly hurtful. The husband was upset, and the author's response was to stop cooking for them. \n\nBut the question is about the author's actions. Is it justified to hold a grudge for six years over this? The author argues that no one else had an issue with the food, only the MIL. Also, she's maintained a good relationship otherwise, just not cooking. The husband feels it's time to move on. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the MIL's actions were unkind and unapologetic. The author's decision to not cook could be seen as a boundary to protect her feelings. However, holding onto the grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. The husband might feel it's time to mend fences, especially if the MIL hasn't noticed the change. \n\nBut the author isn't in a conflict with the MIL; she's just choosing not to cook. If the MIL hasn't apologized or acknowledged the issue, maybe the author's stance is justified. However, the author is being asked if she's in the wrong for not forgiving. In some social contexts, holding onto a grudge for such a long time might be seen as the author's fault, even if the MIL was at fault initially. \n\nAlternatively, the author could be protecting her feelings and setting boundaries, which is reasonable. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal values. In some views, forgiveness is important, while others prioritize personal boundaries. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the answer is A (yes), it might be because she's holding onto the past and could be more forgiving. If B (no), it's because the MIL was at fault and the author is justified in her response. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's reaction is proportionate. The incident happened years ago, and the author's response of not cooking is a personal choice. If the MIL hasn't apologized, the author isn't obligated to forgive. The husband's push to move on might be his own need, but the author isn't in the wrong for maintaining her stance. Therefore, the answer is B (no)."
