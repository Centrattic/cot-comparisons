We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and their husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat her meat initially, asked the FIL if it was cooked enough, and he said yes. Then she took it back to grill more while everyone else was eating. Later, the MIL criticized the food and blamed the husband for not cooking it properly, leading to hurt feelings. The author vowed not to cook for them again, which has lasted six years. Now the husband wants to move on, but the author is conflicted.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding onto this grudge. Let's consider the key points.\n\n1. **Initial Incident**: The MIL didn't like the meat's doneness. But others didn't have a problem. The author's MIL specifically took it upon herself to re-cook it. Then, later, she criticized the food and blamed the husband, which caused emotional distress. The husband was upset and had to walk away.\n\n2. **Author's Response**: The author decided to stop cooking for them. This is a personal choice, but the question is if it's justified. The author's husband is now pushing to move on, possibly for Easter dinner.\n\n3. **Duration of the Grudge**: Six years is a long time. The author hasn't cooked for them since, but they have a good relationship otherwise. The author doesn't think the MIL noticed the absence of cooking.\n\n4. **MIL's Actions**: The MIL's criticism was harsh and hurtful. She didn't apologize and instead reiterated her complaint. That could be seen as unkind and damaging.\n\n5. **Author's Perspective**: The author feels justified because the criticism was unwarranted and the MIL didn't apologize. The husband's feelings were hurt, and the author is standing by their vow.\n\n6. **Husband's Perspective**: The husband wants to move past it, which may be for their family's harmony or to maintain a good relationship with his parents. The author is being asked to cook, but maybe the husband feels guilt or pressure from his parents.\n\n7. **Potential for Forgiveness**: Holding a grudge for six years might indicate that the author still feels wronged. However, forgiveness is a personal decision and can depend on the severity of the harm and the offender's remorse. In this case, the MIL showed no remorse, which could make forgiveness harder.\n\n8. **Impact on Relationships**: The author says they have a good relationship otherwise. Not cooking hasn't caused major issues. The husband might want to mend that specific aspect, but the author might feel it's not necessary if there's no apology.\n\n9. **Ethical Considerations**: Is it wrong to not forgive someone who hasn't apologized? Some might argue that holding a grudge is harmful, but others might say it's justified if there's no reconciliation. The author isn't being malicious; they just won't cook for the MIL as a personal boundary.\n\n10. **Practical Aspects**: The author's husband is not a good cook, so the author is the only one who can prepare meals. This could be a point of contention if the husband is pressuring the author to cook despite the past issue.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's decision not to cook could be seen as a personal boundary in response to hurtful behavior. The MIL's actions were unkind, and the author is protecting their emotional well-being by not engaging in something that reminds them of the hurt. Forgiveness is a personal choice, and without an apology, it's reasonable for the author to hold onto their decision. However, some might argue that holding a grudge for six years is excessive, but given the lack of remorse from the MIL, it's not unreasonable.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author is standing by their boundary in response to the MIL's hurtful actions without an apology.\n"
