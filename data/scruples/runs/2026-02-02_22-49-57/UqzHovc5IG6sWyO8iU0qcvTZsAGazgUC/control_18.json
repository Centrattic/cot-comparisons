We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food initially because she thought the meat wasn't cooked enough, then later re-grilled it. After that, the MIL criticized the food to the husband, which upset him. The author stopped cooking for them since then. Now, the husband wants to move on, especially for an upcoming Easter dinner.\n\nSo, the key points are: The MIL's behavior was unkind and public, leading to the husband feeling hurt. The author stopped cooking as a result, and it's been six years. The question is whether holding a grudge for that long is justified.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, the MIL's actions were hurtful. The author's vow to never cook again was a direct response to protect their husband's feelings and avoid further conflict. The author also mentions that no one else had issues with the food, which makes the MIL's criticism seem targeted. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries based on a past negative experience. Holding a grudge long-term can be seen as a personal choice, especially if the other party hasn't apologized. The author's actions are a way of self-preservation and respecting their husband's feelings. However, there's also the aspect of forgiveness and moving on, but the MIL hasn't shown remorse. \n\nThe author's husband is advocating for moving on, but the author's stance is understandable given the circumstances. It's a matter of personal boundaries and emotional well-being. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the author's actions are a response to protect themselves and their husband from further hurtful interactions.\n"
