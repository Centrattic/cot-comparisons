As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The situation is that the girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author thinks is rare. He's been skeptical, heard stories about parents making up intolerances, and wants her to try the foods again to see if she can eat them. But he's conflicted about testing her without her knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if the author's actions are wrong. Doubting someone's health issues can be tricky. If the girlfriend is genuinely experiencing symptoms and avoiding these foods, the author's skepticism might be undermining her experiences. Even if it's rare, it's not impossible. The author's motivation is to help her eat more freely, but his approach could be harmful. Forcing her to try the foods without her consent could breach trust and make her feel disbelieved. Friends suggested sneaking food into her diet, but he's right to think that's a line not to cross. Trust and respect in a relationship are key. The wrong here is about disbelieving her symptoms and potentially pressuring her into something she's not comfortable with. Even if his intentions are good, the method is questionable. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
