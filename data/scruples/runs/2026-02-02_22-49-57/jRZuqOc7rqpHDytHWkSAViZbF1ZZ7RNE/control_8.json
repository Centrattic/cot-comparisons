As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. The situation is that his girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which he thinks are very rare. He's skeptical because he's heard stories about people being told they have intolerances when they actually don't. He's trying to get her to eat those things again, but friends suggested sneaking it in, which he's against.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if his skepticism is valid. While it's true that some people might misdiagnose themselves, having multiple intolerances isn't impossible. However, the user is questioning her medical conditions directly, which could be seen as dismissive. Trust is important in a relationship, and doubting her health issues might erode that trust. \n\nHe's trying to encourage her to test her intolerances by eating them again. But if she's already been diagnosed, maybe by a doctor, then challenging that without her consent could be problematic. Sneaking gluten or lactose into her food, as friends suggested, is definitely crossing a trust line. He's against that, which is good, but his probing might still be making her feel doubted.\n\nAlso, the fact that she developed these intolerances later in life isn't unheard of. Some people develop food sensitivities over time. The user's approach of urging her to try them again could be harmful if she's genuinely sensitive. It's important to respect her health choices unless there's a medical reason to question them, which he doesn't mention.\n\nSo, while his intentions might be to help her eat normally again, his method of skepticism and pushing her to consume potentially harmful foods without proper medical oversight could be seen as wrong. He should probably support her in consulting a healthcare professional instead of doubting her directly.\n"
