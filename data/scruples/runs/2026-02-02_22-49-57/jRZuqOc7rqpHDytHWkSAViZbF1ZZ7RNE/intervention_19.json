As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's girlfriend (gf) has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances. The author is skeptical because these are considered rare when combined. They mention that some mothers might misdiagnose their children intentionally, which makes the author question the validity of the gf's conditions. The author is trying to get the gf to test these intolerances again, maybe to see if they're real. However, they're also considering whether sneaking gluten or lactose into her food would cross a trust line.\n\nFirst, let's consider the medical aspect. Intolerances can develop over time. For example, lactose intolerance can occur in adulthood. However, multiple intolerances are less common, but not impossible. The author's skepticism might stem from a desire to reduce dietary restrictions for their partner, which seems caring, but the approach might be problematic.\n\nThe key issues here are trust and respect in the relationship. The author is trying to challenge the gf's self-diagnosis, which could be seen as dismissive. Even if the author's intention is to help, questioning the validity of someone's health issues without evidence can be hurtful. Trust in a relationship means respecting each other's experiences and choices, even if you disagree.\n\nThe author is considering testing the gf's reactions by giving her hidden gluten or lactose. That's a risky move because if the gf actually has an intolerance, it could cause physical harm. Plus, doing this without her consent breaches trust. The author is aware of this and is conflicted, which shows they're considering the ethical implications. However, their doubts are based on anecdotal evidence (hearsay about mothers misdiagnosing) rather than concrete proof.\n\nAnother angle is the author's role. They are not a medical professional, so they shouldn't diagnose or de-diagnose someone. The proper approach would be to encourage the gf to consult a healthcare provider for proper testing. Instead, the author is trying to take matters into their own hands, which could lead to conflict.\n\nIn terms of the relationship dynamics, the author's actions might undermine the gf's autonomy. People with dietary restrictions often manage their health carefully, and having a partner question those choices can feel invalidating. Trust is crucial here; if the author's skepticism leads to actions that breach trust, it could damage the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's intentions might be good (wanting to reduce restrictions), but the method (questioning the diagnosis and considering sneaking food) is problematic. The right approach would be to support the gf in getting professional medical advice rather than doubting her self-reported conditions. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
