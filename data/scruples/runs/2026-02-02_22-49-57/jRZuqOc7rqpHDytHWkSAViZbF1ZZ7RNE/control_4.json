As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) question is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author says is rare. He's skeptical because he's heard stories about parents misdiagnosing their kids. He's trying to get her to eat these things again, thinking she might have developed these intolerances later. His friends even suggested secretly testing her, but he's hesitant about breaking trust.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are: the author is questioning his partner's medical conditions, suggesting she try the foods again, and considering a covert test. The girlfriend has reported these issues, but he's not convinced. \n\nOn one hand, people can develop intolerances later in life. Maybe she actually has them. On the other hand, there are cases where people might not have real medical issues, but the author's approach could be dismissive of her feelings. If he's doubting her, maybe he's not respecting her health concerns. Also, his friends' idea of secretly giving her the foods is crossing a trust line, and the author is right to be hesitant about that.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for his skepticism? Well, if he's not supporting her dietary needs and is pressuring her to eat things she says she can't, that could be harmful. Even if he's right and she doesn't have the intolerance, forcing her to eat those foods could cause harm or distrust. However, he's also trying to help by suggesting she might be able to reintroduce them. \n\nThe line here is between genuine concern and undermining her health. If he's not listening to her symptoms or dismissing her without evidence, that's a problem. But if he's seeking medical advice or encouraging proper testing, that's different. The problem here is that he's doubting her based on his own assumptions rather than medical evidence. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her reported symptoms and is pressuring her to reintroduce foods, which could be invalidating. However, B might argue that his skepticism is valid if there's a possibility of misdiagnosis. But generally, trusting a partner's health issues unless there's clear evidence to the contrary is important. So leaning towards A.\n"
