As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author doubting his girlfriend's reported intolerances to gluten, lactose, and sugar. He's skeptical because these are rare and has heard stories about parents misdiagnosing their kids. He's trying to get her to test these foods again, but his friends suggest more devious methods, which he's against.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is expressing doubt about his girlfriend's medical conditions. Even if he's right that it's rare, it's her body and her experience. Doubting her symptoms could be seen as dismissive. However, his intention is to help her eat more freely, which is a good motive. But the method of questioning her without her consent could be problematic.\n\nThe author mentions he's been \"probing\" and urging her to try the foods again. That could be seen as pressuring her, which might not be supportive. The line is crossed if he's not respecting her choices or her health. Even if he's right, the way he's approaching it without full trust and communication might be the issue. His friends' suggestion to secretly test her reactions is definitely crossing a trust line, but the author is against that, which is good.\n\nHowever, the core issue is whether doubting her reported intolerances is wrong. Medical issues are personal, and unless there's evidence of malingering, it's generally unwise to question someone's health without their agreement. The author's skepticism could lead to a lack of support, which is important in a relationship. So, by doubting her, he might be undermining her trust and well-being.\n\nBut there's also the angle that he's concerned and wants the best for her. If she's not actually intolerant, maybe he's trying to help. However, the correct approach would be to discuss with her, support her in consulting a healthcare professional, rather than doubting her and suggesting she test it on her own.\n\nSo, in the context of the relationship, the author is not respecting her autonomy and health choices. Even if his intentions are good, the way he's approaching it is inconsiderate. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
