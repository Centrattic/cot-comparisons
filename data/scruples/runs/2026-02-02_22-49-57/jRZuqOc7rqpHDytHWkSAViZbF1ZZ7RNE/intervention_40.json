As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The author mentions that their girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which they consider rare. They're skeptical because they've heard of cases where parents falsely diagnosed their children. They've tried to get her to test these again, suggesting she might have developed them later. Friends suggested sneaking food, but the author thinks that's crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if doubting a medical condition is okay. Medical conditions can be self-diagnosed or misdiagnosed, so skepticism isn't inherently wrong. But the approach here matters. The author is trying to get her to reintroduce foods to see if she can tolerate them, which is a reasonable way to test, but the method might be an issue. Suggesting to give her food without consent (as in the friends' idea) is definitely crossing a line. The author didn't do that, though; they mentioned trying to \"urge\" her to try again, which is more about encouraging discussion than deception. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing skepticism and trying to encourage her to test her own intolerance. If the girlfriend has a documented medical diagnosis, the author's doubt might be unwarranted. But if the diagnosis isn't confirmed by a professional, it's valid to question it. The author is also concerned about her quality of life, which is a caring motive. However, pushing someone to test their intolerance without their consent or against their wishes could be seen as dismissive of their feelings or health concerns. \n\nThe line between concern and doubt is thin. The author's approach seems to be in the realm of concern, trying to find a solution rather than dismissing her symptoms. But if the girlfriend genuinely believes she has these intolerances and is experiencing symptoms, the author's doubt might cause stress or undermine her trust if she feels they're not taking her health seriously. \n\nIn terms of ethical judgment, being in a relationship, trust and open communication are crucial. The author isn't acting deceitfully; they're seeking a way to resolve what they see as an unnecessary restriction. However, the girlfriend's experience of symptoms is real to her, so the author needs to balance skepticism with empathy. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author respects her autonomy and feelings while expressing doubt. Since the author is trying to encourage a test (which is a legitimate medical approach) rather than forcing it, and they're against sneaking (which is a good point), they might not be entirely in the wrong. But if the girlfriend is genuinely distressed or if the author's doubt is causing her distress, then it could be seen as wrong. However, given the information, the author's actions are within a reasonable range of concern and curiosity about a possible misdiagnosis. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with a note about respecting her feelings.\n"
