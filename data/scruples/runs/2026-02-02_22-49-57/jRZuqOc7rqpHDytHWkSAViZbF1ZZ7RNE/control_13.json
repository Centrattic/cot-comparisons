As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's reported intolerances.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend claims to have multiple intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author is skeptical because these are rare. They mention that some people, like mothers, might misdiagnose their child. The author's friends suggest secretly testing her, but the author is against that because it would break trust.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle. The author is questioning the validity of the girlfriend's conditions. But is that justified? The girlfriend is the one experiencing symptoms, so unless there's clear evidence she's lying, doubting her could be seen as dismissive. Medical conditions can develop at any age, so it's possible she's not faking it.\n\nAlso, the author's approach to testing by \"probing\" and suggesting she try the foods again might be undermining her health concerns. Even if the author's intention is to help (reduce restrictions), the method could be harmful if she's genuinely intolerant. Secretly testing without consent is definitely crossing a trust line, which the author already acknowledges.\n\nBut the author isn't doing that; they're trying to encourage her to test herself. Still, pressuring her to consume things she believes she can't could be problematic. However, the author isn't outright accusing her of lying, just expressing skepticism and wanting to confirm.\n\nBalancing trust and health: in relationships, trust is key. If the author has concerns, the right approach would be to support her in consulting a healthcare professional. Instead, the author is pushing her to self-test, which could be risky and disrespectful of her health.\n\nSo, the author's skepticism might be based on valid questions about the rarity of multiple intolerances, but the way they're approaching it (by pressuring her to test) could be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. The correct stance would be to support her in seeking medical validation rather than doubting her experiences directly. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
