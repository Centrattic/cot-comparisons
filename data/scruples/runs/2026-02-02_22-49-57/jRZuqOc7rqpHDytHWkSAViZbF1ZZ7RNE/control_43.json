As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the boyfriend) is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's food intolerances. The main points are her having multiple rare intolerances and his skepticism, including trying to get her to test them again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the girlfriend's claims. Gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances together are indeed rare, which makes the boyfriend's doubt plausible. However, self-diagnosed or misdiagnosed intolerances can happen, and sometimes people do develop them later in life. The boyfriend's concern might stem from wanting to avoid unnecessary dietary restrictions, but he should respect her health decisions unless there's evidence of harm.\n\nThe boyfriend's approach is key here. Probing and urging her to reintroduce foods is one thing, but secretly giving her those foods without her consent is a breach of trust. The friends' suggestion to test without her knowledge crosses an ethical line. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and undermining her health choices without her agreement could harm the relationship. \n\nEven if his intentions are good, the method is important. He should encourage her to seek medical advice rather than test her himself. If there's a genuine concern that she's being misinformed (like the mothers manipulating their daughters), it's better to approach it with support and evidence, not by forcing her to eat foods she avoids. \n\nSo, while his doubt isn't entirely unfounded, his actions, especially the suggestion to test without consent, are problematic. The answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her autonomy and health decisions, which is a trust issue. However, if the boyfriend's actions are only about questioning and encouraging testing with consent, it's different, but the friends' suggestion is a red flag. The key is the method\u2014without consent, it's wrong.\n"
