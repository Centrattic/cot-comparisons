As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is wrong for doubting his girlfriend's food intolerances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend claims to have multiple intolerances (gluten, lactose, sugar) which are indeed rare. The author is skeptical, having heard stories where people were misdiagnosed or even had parents exaggerate conditions. He's trying to encourage her to test these by reintroducing the foods, but friends suggest more drastic measures, which he's against due to trust issues.\n\nNow, determining if he's in the wrong. Doubting a partner's health issues can come off as dismissive. Even if the conditions are rare, it's not his place to question her experiences unless he has evidence. Intolerances aren't always well-documented; they can develop later in life. His approach of suggesting she try the foods again could be seen as undermining her health choices. However, his intentions are to help her eat more freely, which is caring, but the method might be problematic. Trust is important, and pressuring someone to consume something they avoid for health reasons could breach that trust. Friends' suggestions to secretly test her reactions are definitely crossing a line, but the author is against that, showing he respects her autonomy to some extent. \n\nOn the other hand, if there's a possibility that her intolerances are not real, there's a valid concern. But without proper evidence, the author shouldn't assume she's lying. It's possible she's been misdiagnosed, but that's not his responsibility to investigate. He should probably encourage open communication with a healthcare professional instead of testing her himself. \n\nSo, the author is in a tricky situation. His skepticism might stem from genuine concern, but doubting her without evidence can be hurtful. The key is whether his actions are respectful. Pressuring her to eat things she avoids for health reasons could be seen as dismissive. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not fully supporting her health choices and instead trying to challenge them, even if well-intentioned.\n"
