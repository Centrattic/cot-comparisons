As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about doubting their girlfriend's reported intolerances to gluten, lactose, and sugar. The user is skeptical because these are rare, and they mention stories where parents misdiagnose their kids. They've been trying to get her to eat gluten or lactose again, suggesting she might have developed these intolerances. Friends suggested secretly testing her, but the author thinks that's crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is doubting their partner's medical conditions. The girlfriend has three specific intolerances, which the author finds rare. They are trying to encourage her to eat the restricted foods, which could be seen as dismissive of her symptoms. The author is also considering a more extreme step (secretly testing) but refrains. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, trust and respect are crucial. If the girlfriend has been diagnosed by a medical professional, the author's doubt could be seen as not respecting her health concerns. Even if the author is concerned about the rarity, they should approach it by discussing with her or possibly with her doctor, not by pushing her to consume things that might make her ill. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern might stem from wanting to reduce restrictions. But dismissing a partner's health issues without evidence can erode trust. The fact that the author is considering sneaking in the foods (as per friends' suggestion) but stops short shows they know it's wrong. However, even the public encouragement to consume problematic foods could be harmful. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel disbelieved or not supported. If her symptoms are real, the author's doubt could be harmful. Medical issues, even if they develop later, are valid. The author's approach might come across as dismissive. So, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're doubting their partner's health without valid reason and possibly undermining her trust and well-being.\n"
