As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is wrong for doubting his girlfriend's food intolerances.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend claims to have multiple intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author mentions that having all three is rare. He's skeptical because he's heard of cases where parents misdiagnose their children. That's a valid concern, but how does it translate to his actions?\n\nHe's been trying to encourage her to reintroduce these foods. The question is whether that's wrong. On one hand, if she truly has these intolerances, forcing her to eat them could cause her physical discomfort. That's a health risk. On the other, if she's not actually intolerant, he's trying to help her expand her diet.\n\nThe friends suggested tricking her by giving her food with those ingredients without her knowing. That's definitely crossing a line. The author says he doesn't want to do that, which is good. But his approach is still probing and urging her to try them again. The problem is, without medical confirmation, he's assuming she's faking or misdiagnosed. That's dismissive of her health concerns.\n\nEven if the author's intentions are good, doubting her symptoms could erode trust. She might feel he's not taking her health seriously. The fact that her conditions developed later in life is a red flag, but some people can develop intolerances as they age. The author's skepticism might be based on incomplete information.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? By not respecting her dietary restrictions and pushing her to consume foods she believes are harmful, he's risking her well-being. Even if he's right, the method is problematic. The answer is A because he's dismissing her health concerns and potentially endangering her by encouraging behavior that could cause harm. Trust and respect are key in a relationship, and his actions undermine that.\n"
