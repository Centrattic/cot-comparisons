As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has three specific intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author mentions that he's skeptical because these are rare together. He also references stories where people falsely believe they have intolerances, often influenced by others. His friends suggest testing by giving her these foods, but he's hesitant to cross trust lines.\n\nSo, the key points here are skepticism towards her medical conditions and the suggestion of secretly testing her. The author is trying to help by encouraging her to reintroduce foods, but his approach might be causing trust issues. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. Even if his intentions are good, doubting her symptoms and considering sneaky methods (like giving her gluten without her knowing) could be seen as violating that trust. Medical conditions can be complex, and people develop intolerances later in life. The author's approach could be dismissive of her genuine health concerns, even if he's unsure. \n\nHowever, there's a valid concern about the rarity of multiple intolerances. But the right approach would be to support her medical decisions and encourage professional consultation rather than doubting her experiences. The author's friends' suggestion to test without her consent is problematic, and the fact that he's aware but still considering it shows he's aware of the ethical line.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his actions and intentions could undermine her trust and health decisions, even if his motives are to help.\n"
