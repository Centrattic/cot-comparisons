As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend has three specific intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author finds this combination rare and is skeptical, citing stories where parents might have influenced their children's beliefs about intolerances. He's been trying to get her to reintroduce these foods, suggesting she might have \"developed\" them later, and friends have suggested more extreme measures, but he's resisting crossing a trust line.\n\nNow, the key points here are about medical conditions and trust in a relationship. Gluten intolerance can range from mild to severe, like Celiac disease, which is autoimmune. Lactose intolerance is common in some populations. Sugar intolerance is less common but possible. However, having all three is rare, which the author points out. But rarity doesn't mean it's not real. \n\nThe author's actions include questioning her conditions, urging her to reintroduce foods, and considering sneaking them into her diet (which he's against). The ethical issues here involve respecting her health choices. Even if he doubts the validity, he should respect her self-reported symptoms unless there's a medical reason to question them. \n\nIf she's been diagnosed by a healthcare professional, then his doubt might be unwarranted. If she's self-diagnosed, that's a different scenario. But the author is acting on his own skepticism rather than seeking medical validation together. Pressuring her to eat foods she believes she can't tolerate could harm their trust and her health. \n\nAdditionally, the friends' suggestion to secretly test her reactions is definitely crossing a trust boundary. The author correctly avoids that. However, his ongoing doubt and attempts to challenge her diet could still be harmful. Trust and support in relationships are crucial, especially regarding health decisions. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not respecting her autonomy regarding her health. Even if his intentions are to help, the method is intrusive and disrespectful. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
