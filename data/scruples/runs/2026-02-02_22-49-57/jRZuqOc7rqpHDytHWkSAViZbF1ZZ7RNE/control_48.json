As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the boyfriend doubting his girlfriend's gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances. The main points here are the boyfriend's skepticism, his attempts to get her to try those foods again, and the friends suggesting a more drastic approach.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical validity. The girlfriend claims to have multiple intolerances, which the author notes as rare. The author brings up a known issue where some people might misdiagnose themselves or others. That's a valid point since self-diagnosis can be problematic.\n\nThen there's the aspect of trust in the relationship. The boyfriend is doubting her reported symptoms, which can be seen as undermining her health concerns. Intolerances are real for many people, even if they aren't life-threatening like allergies. Dismissing someone's health issues can lead to conflict and hurt feelings.\n\nThe boyfriend's approach of encouraging her to reintroduce foods is one way to test the validity, but that could be risky. If she actually has an intolerance, consuming those foods might cause discomfort. Also, suggesting that she might have developed these intolerances later in life isn't necessarily wrong, but without proper medical testing, it's hard to verify.\n\nThe friends' suggestion to secretly test her reactions crosses a trust boundary, so the boyfriend is right to hesitate there. However, his open doubt and pushing her to try the foods might still be problematic because it dismisses her experiences.\n\nAnother angle is the importance of respecting someone's health choices. Even if there's a possibility of self-diagnosis, the boyfriend shouldn't force her to consume things she's avoiding. Trust and mutual respect are key in a relationship. If he's not supportive, it can strain their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's concern is understandable. He wants her to have a normal diet and might be worried about unnecessary restrictions. But the way he's approaching it\u2014by doubting her and trying to get her to test it\u2014could be seen as invalidating her feelings and health needs.\n\nSo, considering all this, the boyfriend is in a tricky situation. His intentions might be good, but his methods are causing issues. The right approach would be to support her in seeking medical confirmation rather than doubting her or pressuring her to eat things that might affect her well-being. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not trusting her reported symptoms and for the way he's handling the situation.\n"
