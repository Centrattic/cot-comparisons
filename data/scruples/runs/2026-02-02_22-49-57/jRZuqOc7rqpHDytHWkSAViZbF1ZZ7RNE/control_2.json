As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves doubting their girlfriend's food intolerances.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The girlfriend has three intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author is skeptical because these are rare together. They mention that they've heard of cases where people are misdiagnosed, like a mother making up the intolerance. The author is trying to get the girlfriend to eat those things again but friends suggest sneaking it in, which he's against.\n\nSo, the key points here are skepticism towards the girlfriend's claimed intolerances and the actions taken. The question is whether the author is wrong for doubting and trying to get her to eat those foods again.\n\nFrom a medical standpoint, food intolerances can develop over time. Even if they're rare, they can exist. The author's skepticism might be valid if there's no medical evidence, but assuming without evidence could be problematic. However, the author isn't trying to harm the girlfriend; they want her to eat normally again. \n\nBut the girlfriend might have legitimate issues. If she's been avoiding these foods, maybe she's already self-diagnosed or has a doctor's diagnosis. The author's probing might be insistent without considering her feelings. Also, suggesting to secretly test her reactions (as friends suggested) is crossing trust boundaries, which the author rightly avoids. However, openly encouraging her to try might still be pushing her, which could be seen as dismissive of her experience.\n\nTrust and communication are crucial in relationships. If the girlfriend feels her health concerns are being doubted, that could erode trust. The author's actions, while well-meaning, might be undermining her. It's possible the author isn't wrong in being curious or wanting to help, but the approach could be disrespectful. The line is between concern and doubt without evidence. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong if their doubt is causing harm or distrust, even if the skepticism isn't unfounded. Relationships require respecting each other's experiences unless there's clear evidence of dishonesty. Since the author has no proof of the girlfriend's misrepresentation, doubting her could be unfair. The answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because the approach risks undermining her trust and health without sufficient evidence.\n"
