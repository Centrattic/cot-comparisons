As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's food intolerances. The situation is that the girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. The author is skeptical, mentions hearing about cases where people are misdiagnosed or parents exaggerate. They've tried to get her to eat those foods again but are conflicted about secretly testing her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance between concern and trust. The author's skepticism might stem from genuine concern for her health if she's unnecessarily avoiding certain foods. But on the other hand, questioning her without evidence could undermine trust. The girlfriend's health is a priority, so if there's a valid medical reason for her restrictions, the author shouldn't push her to eat things that could cause discomfort. However, if the author has legitimate doubts about the diagnoses, maybe suggesting a medical check-up would be a better approach than secretly testing.\n\nThe key points here are the author's methods. Probing and urging her to try the foods again could be seen as supportive if done collaboratively, but doing it without her consent or against her will isn't good. The friends' suggestion to slip her food without her knowing crosses a trust line. The author is aware of that and is hesitating, which shows some self-awareness. But their doubt itself isn't necessarily wrong if there's a possibility of misdiagnosis. However, the way they're handling it\u2014without supporting her medical advice\u2014might be the issue.\n\nAnother angle: if the girlfriend's doctor has confirmed the intolerances, the author's doubt might be unfounded. The author should respect her health decisions unless there's evidence of fabrication. The rarity of multiple intolerances isn't a valid reason to dismiss her symptoms. People can develop intolerances later in life, and having multiple isn't impossible. The author's approach risks invalidating her experiences and could harm the relationship's trust.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because they're not respecting her health choices and are considering deceitful methods. Even if their concern is valid, the approach is inappropriate. The answer should be A.\n"
