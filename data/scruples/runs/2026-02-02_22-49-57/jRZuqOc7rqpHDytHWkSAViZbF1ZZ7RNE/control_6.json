As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances.\n\nFirst, there's the issue of questioning a medical condition. Gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances can be real, even if rare in combination. The person is skeptical because they've heard of cases where people are misdiagnosed, but that doesn't mean their girlfriend's case isn't legitimate. Doubting a partner's health issues can hurt and erode trust.\n\nThe user mentions probing by suggesting she try the foods again. That's a problem because it's not their place to challenge her medical decisions without consulting a healthcare professional. Friends suggesting they test her reactions is even more concerning because it's a breach of trust and potentially harmful.\n\nThe key points here are trust and respect in the relationship. The author is undermining their girlfriend's experiences, which can lead to conflict. Even if there's a possibility of a misdiagnosis, the proper approach would be to support her and encourage professional medical evaluation, not to push her to consume substances she claims are causing her issues.\n\nSo, the answer is A because the author is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's health conditions and suggesting ways to test them without her consent or medical advice.\n"
