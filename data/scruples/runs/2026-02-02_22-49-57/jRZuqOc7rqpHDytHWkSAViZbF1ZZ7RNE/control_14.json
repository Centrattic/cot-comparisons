As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the boyfriend being skeptical about his girlfriend's multiple food intolerances\u2014gluten, lactose, and sugar. He's heard stories of people faking these to control their diet or due to parental influence. He's trying to get her to reintroduce these foods into her diet but is conflicted about whether it's crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She claims to have multiple intolerances, which are real medical conditions. Even if they're rare, that doesn't mean they're not valid. The boyfriend's skepticism might come from a place of concern\u2014he wants her to eat more normally. However, his approach of suggesting she try the foods again could be seen as dismissive of her health. \n\nNow, the key points here are trust and respect. The boyfriend is questioning her conditions, which could undermine her trust in him. Even if his intentions are good, the act of doubting her health issues can be harmful. Food intolerances can cause real discomfort, and forcing someone to consume something they're avoiding can lead to physical and emotional distress. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's friends suggested secretly testing her by giving her the foods. That definitely crosses a trust line. The boyfriend himself is considering this but hesitates, which shows he knows it's wrong. His main conflict is between his concern and respecting her autonomy. \n\nIn relationships, especially when it comes to health issues, trust and support are crucial. Even if the boyfriend is right in his suspicion (though that's uncertain), the way he's approaching it is problematic. Doubting her conditions without evidence and pressuring her to reintroduce foods can be seen as invalidating her experiences. \n\nSo, even though he has good intentions, his actions are not respectful of her autonomy and health. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he's not supporting her as she is and is instead challenging her health claims, which can erode trust and cause harm.\n"
