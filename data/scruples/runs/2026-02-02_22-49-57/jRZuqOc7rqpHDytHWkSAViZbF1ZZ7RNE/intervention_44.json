As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's dietary restrictions. The girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. He's skeptical because he's heard stories where people's allergies are not real, maybe influenced by family. He's trying to encourage her to try those foods again to see if she can actually tolerate them, but some friends suggested sneaking it into her food, which he thinks is crossing a line.\n\nHmm. So the main points here are the author's skepticism about his girlfriend's intolerances and his methods of trying to test them. First, is it wrong to doubt someone's health claims? Well, dietary restrictions are personal and can be complex. If the girlfriend has a medical diagnosis, then the author's doubt might be problematic because it's questioning her health without evidence. But if she hasn't been properly tested, maybe the author has a point in wanting to verify. However, the approach of urging her to try the foods again might be pushing her to risk her health. Also, the idea of friends suggesting to sneak the foods into her meals without her consent is definitely crossing a line, but the author refuses that, which is good.\n\nThe author's concern about trust is valid here. If the girlfriend truly has these intolerances, testing them without her consent or against her will could damage the relationship. Even if the author's intentions are good, he should respect her choices and medical decisions. Unless there's clear evidence that her restrictions are unfounded, questioning them might come off as dismissive of her health needs. The fact that she used to tolerate these foods as a child might not be relevant if her sensitivities developed later due to various factors like changes in gut health, stress, or other conditions. \n\nBut the author's approach of \"probing more\" and \"urging her to try\" could be seen as pressuring her, which is not healthy. Trust in a relationship requires respecting each other's boundaries and health concerns. Even if he's curious or skeptical, the right way would be to support her decision or encourage professional medical consultation rather than trying to test it himself. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's doubting his girlfriend's health without sufficient reason and is pressuring her to change her diet, which could be harmful. Even if his intentions are to help her eat more freely, he's not respecting her autonomy in medical decisions. The fact that he's aware of cases where people are falsely told they have intolerances is a point, but that doesn't give him the right to question her without evidence. The correct approach would be to discuss with her doctors or professionals, not to test it himself. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
