As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. The situation is that his girlfriend has multiple intolerances\u2014gluten, lactose, and sugar\u2014which are rare. He's skeptical because he's heard of cases where people are told they have intolerances when they don't, like mothers influencing their daughters. He's trying to get her to test these things again, but some friends suggest doing it secretly, which he feels crosses a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Doubting someone's health conditions can be a sensitive issue. The girlfriend has stated her intolerances, and he's questioning their validity. But why? He mentions it's rare, which is true, but not impossible. However, his skepticism might stem from good intentions, wanting her to have a more varied diet. But does that justify his actions?\n\nHe's trying to encourage her to try gluten and lactose again. That's one thing. But the friends suggest secretly giving her these foods, which he refuses. So he's not agreeing to deception. But his questioning her conditions in the first place could be seen as undermining her trust. If she genuinely believes she has these intolerances and he's doubting her, that could cause stress. But maybe she's misdiagnosed or has psychological factors. However, the line between concern and distrust is thin here.\n\nIs it his place to challenge her health claims? If she's been diagnosed by a medical professional, then questioning that diagnosis without evidence might not be fair. But if she's self-diagnosed or the diagnosis is questionable, then his concern might be valid. The problem is, without knowing the specifics of how she got diagnosed, it's hard to say. But generally, respecting someone's health claims is important unless there's clear evidence they're false. Secretly testing without her consent is definitely wrong, but he's against that.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's expressing his doubts respectfully and suggesting testing under her consent, maybe not. But if he's dismissing her experiences and not trusting her, that could be harmful. Since he's not going the covert route and is trying to encourage her to test it again, maybe his intentions are good. However, the fact that he's doubting her without evidence might be seen as disrespectful. The answer might lean towards AITA (A) because doubting someone's health without good reason can be hurtful, but also B because he's concerned about her quality of life. Hmm, tricky. Probably AITA is A because he's in the wrong for not trusting her health claims without evidence. But maybe there's a middle ground. I think the answer is A, but I need to confirm.\n"
