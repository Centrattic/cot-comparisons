As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they're doubting their girlfriend's gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances. They mention these are rare and that they've heard stories where parents misdiagnose their kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's reasonable here. The author is skeptical because the combination is rare, but that doesn't necessarily mean the girlfriend is faking it. Maybe she has a rare case. But the author is prodding her to try gluten or milk again, which could be harmful if she's truly intolerant. The friends suggested a more devious plan (ambushing her), but the author refuses, which is a good sign they care about trust.\n\nOn one hand, the author is concerned about her health and wants her to eat normally. But doubting a partner's health issues can lead to conflict and distrust. Medical conditions like intolerances are real, even if not always severe. The author's approach might be dismissive of her experiences, even if they're skeptical.\n\nThe key points: The author is questioning a partner's health claims, which can be sensitive. Even if their intentions are good, challenging someone's health without medical evidence can be seen as undermining. However, there's a line between concern and being inconsiderate. The author isn't trying to harm but is maybe not respecting her self-reported symptoms enough.\n\nSo, the answer depends on balance. If the girlfriend has been diagnosed by a doctor, the author's doubt might be unwarranted. If not, maybe the author has a point. However, without evidence, questioning someone's health can be hurtful. The author's friends' suggestion is bad, but the author is against it. Still, the author's probing might not be the best approach. They should encourage medical consultation instead of doubting her.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because doubting a partner's health conditions without evidence can be hurtful and disrespectful, even if well-intentioned. It's important to support and seek medical advice rather than questioning the validity of their experiences.\n"
