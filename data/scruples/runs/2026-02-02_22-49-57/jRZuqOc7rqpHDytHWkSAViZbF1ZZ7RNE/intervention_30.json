As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The author is skeptical because having multiple intolerances is rare, and they've heard stories about people being misdiagnosed or parents influencing their children's diets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances. The author is questioning these, maybe because they seem uncommon. They mention that she used to consume these foods as a child, implying that she might have developed them later, which is possible but not unheard of. However, the author is trying to get her to test her reactions by eating them again, which some friends suggest doing covertly. The author, however, says they don't want to cross a trust line. \n\nNow, the ethical part. Is doubting someone's health condition ever okay? If the author has legitimate concerns, maybe due to the rarity or the possibility of misdiagnosis, but they're approaching it in a way that could be seen as dismissive. However, the author is trying to encourage her to test it, which could be seen as wanting to help, but it's also possible that this is undermining her health choices. The friends' suggestion to secretly test her diet is more problematic, but the author isn't doing that. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has her own health beliefs. If she's been diagnosed by a doctor, the author's skepticism might not be appropriate. Even if the diagnoses are questionable, the author's approach could be seen as pressuring her to eat things that might make her unwell, which could be harmful. Trust is a big factor here. If the author is not respecting her health choices, even if they're skeptical, that could be a breach of trust.\n\nBut the author is also concerned about her diet restrictions, which is understandable. They might think she's unnecessarily limiting herself. However, pushing someone to consume foods they believe they're intolerant to could lead to physical and emotional harm. Even if the author's intentions are good, the action could be harmful. \n\nSo, the key points are: Is the author's skepticism justified? Are their actions (probing, suggesting testing) respectful? The answer might hinge on whether the author is being dismissive versus concerned but supportive. Since the author is trying to encourage testing, maybe through discussion rather than deception, it's a gray area. However, if the girlfriend's symptoms are real, even if the diagnosis is wrong, the author is putting her in a position where she might experience discomfort. That could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the author's intent is to help. \n\nAlso, the fact that the girlfriend has these intolerances that restrict her diet is a valid issue. If the author isn't respecting her dietary needs, that's a problem. But the author is trying to find a middle ground. The friends' suggestion to secretly test is worse, but the author is against that. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong for doubting her health condition and trying to get her to test it, which could undermine her trust and cause harm. However, if the author is genuinely concerned and approaching it with the intention to help, there's a middle ground. But in relationships, respecting each other's health decisions is crucial. So the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they're not respecting her boundaries and health choices, even if their intentions are good.\n"
