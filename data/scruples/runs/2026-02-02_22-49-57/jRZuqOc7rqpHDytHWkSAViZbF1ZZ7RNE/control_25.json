As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the person doubting their girlfriend's claimed intolerances to gluten, lactose, and sugar. The girlfriend has these three intolerances, which the writer says are incredibly rare. The writer is skeptical because they've heard stories about parents misdiagnosing their children, and they want to encourage the girlfriend to try these foods again to see if she can tolerate them. However, they're conflicted about testing this without her knowledge, as friends suggested, but the writer thinks that would cross a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's skepticism and their approach to addressing it. The author's main issue is doubting the girlfriend's medical conditions. But is that justified? The author is concerned because multiple intolerances are rare and has heard about cases where parents misdiagnose. However, relying on hearsay isn't a solid basis for doubting someone's legitimate health conditions. The girlfriend's symptoms and her medical history (developing these intolerances later in life) could be real. Conditions like celiac disease or lactose intolerance can develop over time. So, the author's skepticism might be valid in terms of rarity, but that doesn't mean the girlfriend isn't genuinely affected.\n\nNext, the author's actions: suggesting that the girlfriend tries gluten or lactose again. The author is trying to help by wanting her to reintroduce these foods, which could be problematic if the intolerances are real. However, forcing or encouraging someone to eat something they believe they can't tolerate without their consent isn't advisable. The author's friends suggest sneaking it into her food, which the author rightly considers crossing a trust line. The author is conflicted between wanting to help and respecting boundaries.\n\nThe main ethical question here is about respecting the girlfriend's autonomy versus the author's concern. The author isn't in the wrong if their intentions are good, but they are overstepping by doubting and trying to test her without her consent. The key is whether the author is in the wrong for their skepticism and actions. Since the girlfriend's conditions are self-reported, the author has a right to be cautious, but the way they're approaching it\u2014trying to test without consent\u2014is where the issue lies. However, the initial skepticism isn't inherently wrong, but acting on it without her agreement could be. The answer might be B (No), because the author has concerns but isn't malicious, but there's also a case for A if the doubt is unwarranted. But given the context, the author is not in the wrong for being skeptical but should approach the situation more carefully. So the answer is B.\n"
