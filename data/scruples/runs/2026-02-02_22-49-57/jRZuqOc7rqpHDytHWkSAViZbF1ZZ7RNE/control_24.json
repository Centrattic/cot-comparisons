As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about doubting a girlfriend's intolerances. The user is the author's girlfriend, and she claims to have gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances. The author is skeptical because he's heard of cases where people, like mothers, might misdiagnose their children. He's trying to get her to test these foods again to see if she can tolerate them now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. Intolerances can develop later in life, right? So it's not impossible for her to have developed them. Even if it's rare, it's not unheard of. The author's doubt might be based on a lack of understanding that people can develop new intolerances. So maybe his skepticism is misplaced here.\n\nThen there's the relationship aspect. The author is trying to encourage her to reintroduce these foods. The friends suggested sneaking them into her food, which the author is against. But he's still trying to push her to test them. Is that crossing a boundary? If he's not doing it secretly, but rather suggesting she try them, maybe that's okay, but he's being skeptical of her condition. That could be seen as not respecting her health decisions.\n\nAlso, the author is in a relationship with her, so trust and support are important. If he's doubting her reported symptoms, that could undermine her trust in him. Even if he's concerned for her benefit, questioning her health issues without evidence could be harmful. It's possible that she's genuinely experiencing symptoms, and his doubt might make her feel unsupported.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern is about her quality of life, as these restrictions are limiting. He wants her to be able to eat normally. However, he should approach this with support rather than skepticism. Maybe he should encourage her to consult a medical professional for testing instead of doubting her or pressuring her to try the foods without proper guidance.\n\nThe line between concern and infringement of trust is thin here. If he's suggesting testing through a healthcare provider, that's different from pushing her to eat them without a clear plan. Sneaking in the foods, as the friends suggested, is definitely crossing a line, but the author is against that. So maybe his method is better, but the intention to doubt her condition might still be problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because he's doubting his girlfriend's health claims, which can be hurtful, and even though he's trying to help, his approach could be damaging to the relationship. The right way would be to support her and seek medical advice if there's doubt, rather than pressuring her to prove her intolerances.\n"
