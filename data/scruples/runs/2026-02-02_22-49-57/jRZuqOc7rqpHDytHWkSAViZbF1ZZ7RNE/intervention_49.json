As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. The person (AITA) has a girlfriend who's claimed to have three different intolerances, which the user thinks is rare. He's been skeptical, heard stories about parents misdiagnosing kids, and is trying to get her to test her tolerances again. His friends suggested tricking her by giving her food with those ingredients, but he's against that because it might break trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the possible angles. On one hand, questioning a medical condition could be seen as dismissive. Intolerances can be real and valid, even if they're rare. The girlfriend might be genuinely experiencing symptoms. If the boyfriend is doubting her, that could cause emotional harm. But on the other hand, he's concerned about the rarity and wants to find a solution that allows her to eat those foods again. His friends' idea of sneaking in the foods is questionable, but he's against that, which is good.\n\nIs his skepticism justified? Maybe. Sometimes people develop new intolerances, and some self-diagnose without proper testing. But using a confrontational approach might not be the best. He should probably encourage her to get tested by a healthcare professional instead of pushing her to eat them. The key point is whether his actions are respectful and supportive. Pressuring her to consume things she avoids, even if out of concern, might not be in the wrong, but it's important to approach it with empathy. If he's not being judgmental but is concerned, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's undermining her experience, that's a problem.\n\nThe answer might hinge on intent and method. If he's trying to help but in a supportive way, maybe he's okay. But if he's doubting her symptoms and not respecting her choices, that's a no. The fact that he's considering his friends' advice but refusing to cross the trust line might show he's trying to balance it. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) but with caveats. However, the general consensus in such situations often leans towards respecting the partner's health choices unless there's clear evidence to question them, which would require medical testing, not just personal skepticism. So maybe he is in the wrong for not trusting her and possibly invalidating her concerns.\n"
