As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about doubting his girlfriend's food intolerances\u2014gluten, lactose, and sugar. He's skeptical because he's heard of cases where people are misdiagnosed or where parents might mislead their children. He's trying to get her to test these foods again, but some friends suggest sneaking it in, which he's against. He's conflicted between wanting her to have a normal diet and respecting her health claims.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is questioning his partner's medical conditions, which could be seen as distrust. Even if his intentions are good, doubting her health issues might undermine her trust in him. Food intolerances can be real and vary in onset; someone can develop them later in life. Without a medical reason to doubt her, his skepticism might be unwarranted. Also, suggesting she try these foods without her consent, especially if it's a genuine issue, could be harmful. The fact that he's heard anecdotes about parents misdiagnosing their kids doesn't mean the same applies here. It's important to respect her autonomy and health choices unless there's evidence of malingering, which the author doesn't provide. His friends' suggestion to trick her is definitely crossing a line, but he's correctly avoiding that. However, his probing and urging her to try the foods again could be seen as inconsiderate. The key points are trust, respect for her health decisions, and not making her feel invalidated. So, the author might be in the wrong for doubting her without cause and potentially pressuring her in a way that could harm their relationship.\n"
