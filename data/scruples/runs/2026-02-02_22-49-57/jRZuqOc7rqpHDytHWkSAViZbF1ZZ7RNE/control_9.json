As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has three intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author finds this rare and is skeptical, citing stories where parents might misdiagnose their children. He's trying to encourage her to reintroduce these foods, even suggesting friends recommend secretly giving her gluten or lactose. But he's now unsure if pushing her to test this is crossing a trust line.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. The key points here are skepticism vs. respecting her health choices. The author's concern is valid if the girlfriend's symptoms are not genuine, but assuming she's lying or misdiagnosed without evidence is where the issue lies. \n\nMedical conditions can develop at any age, so it's not impossible for someone to develop intolerance later. The author's approach of suggesting she try the foods again could be seen as dismissive of her health concerns. Even if his intentions are good (to reduce restrictions), forcing or pushing her to consume things she believes she can't tolerate could harm trust and her well-being. \n\nAdditionally, the friends' idea of secretly giving her the foods is definitely crossing a line, and the author is right to resist that. However, his public doubt and attempts to challenge her diet without her consent might still undermine her trust. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's health decisions is crucial unless there's a clear medical reason to question them. The author hasn't presented evidence that her intolerances are fake, just his skepticism. Therefore, his actions might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if she's genuinely affected by these restrictions. \n\nSo, while his intentions might be good, his methods and doubts without proof could be wrong. The answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her autonomy and health choices without sufficient reason.\n"
