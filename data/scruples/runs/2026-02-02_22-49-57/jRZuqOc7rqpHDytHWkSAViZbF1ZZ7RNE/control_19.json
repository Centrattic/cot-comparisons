As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is doubting his girlfriend's reported intolerances to gluten, lactose, and sugar, which are supposed to be rare. He's heard stories where parents might lie about their kids' intolerances, so he's skeptical. He's been trying to get her to eat those foods again to test it, but some friends suggest sneaking it in, which he's against.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. Gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances can be real, and some people develop them later in life. The author is questioning the validity because they're rare. But even rare conditions exist. The fact that someone developed them later isn't impossible. For example, Celiac disease can develop at any age.\n\nThen there's the trust aspect. The author is pushing his girlfriend to test these foods. Even if he's concerned, forcing someone to consume something they can't tolerate is risky. Symptoms can be severe, like stomach pain, diarrhea, or even allergic reactions. If she's honest about her symptoms, she might feel betrayed if he doesn't believe her. On the other hand, if she's misrepresenting her intolerances, maybe there's another issue, but that's speculative.\n\nThe friends' suggestion to sneak the foods into her diet is definitely crossing a trust boundary. The author is against that, which is good, but his approach of urging her to try might still be problematic. If she's experiencing symptoms after eating those foods, whether or not they're real, it's important to respect her experience. Doubting her could lead to conflict or her feeling disrespected.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is to help her eat less restricted. But it's not his place to force or pressure her. It's more about supporting her decisions rather than second-guessing. If she's been diagnosed by medical professionals, challenging that without evidence could be seen as dismissive. However, if the diagnosis is self-reported without proper testing, it's a different angle.\n\nIn relationships, trust is key. The author's skepticism might come from a place of wanting to help, but the way he's approaching it could be hurtful. He should probably discuss his concerns with her openly, maybe suggest medical testing if there's doubt, rather than trying to test it himself. Sneaking or pressuring undermines trust and could harm their relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is acting out of concern but his methods could be harmful. Doubting her without evidence and pressuring her to eat things she says she can't tolerate is likely crossing a line. The right approach would be to support her, maybe seek a second medical opinion if there's doubt, but not to force or test it himself. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
