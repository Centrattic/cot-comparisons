As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy is doubting his girlfriend's food intolerances\u2014gluten, lactose, sugar. He's heard about cases where parents might falsely claim their kids have intolerances, which makes him skeptical. He's been trying to get her to test her own intolerances again, maybe by eating those foods. Some friends suggested secretly giving her these foods to see her reaction, but he's against that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The guy's concern is valid because some people do develop intolerances later in life. But how he's approaching it is questionable. Trying to get her to eat things she's avoiding without her consent could be seen as pressuring her, which might hurt her trust. Also, the idea of secretly giving her gluten or lactose is definitely a breach of trust. Even if his intentions are good, the method might be harmful.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, she's been diagnosed with these intolerances. If she's been managing them and it's affecting her health, then disregarding that could lead to physical discomfort or medical issues. But the guy's skepticism could lead to conflict. The key here is whether he's respecting her medical condition and her choices.\n\nMedical professionals usually take self-reported symptoms seriously unless there's a reason to doubt. If the girlfriend has actual medical evidence (like a doctor's diagnosis or test results), then the guy's doubt might be unfounded. However, if she doesn't have that, then his concern isn't entirely baseless. But even then, how he's handling it is problematic.\n\nThe friends' suggestion to secretly test her reactions is a red flag. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and covert actions can damage that. The guy, while not going all the way with the friends' plan, is still probing and urging her to test it, which could be seen as manipulative or disrespectful of her boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the guy is trying to challenge her condition without fully respecting her experience. Even if he's right in his doubt, the approach is invasive and could harm their relationship. Therefore, he's in the wrong (Answer A).\n"
