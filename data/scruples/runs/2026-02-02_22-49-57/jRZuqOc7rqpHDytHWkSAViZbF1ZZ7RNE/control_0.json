As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about their girlfriend having gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. They're skeptical and have been trying to get her to eat those things again, worried that maybe she's been misdiagnosed or even faking it. Their friends suggested secretly testing her by giving her the foods, but the author thinks that's crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I should consider the medical aspect. Intolerances can develop over time, right? Like maybe someone didn't have issues as a child but developed them later. So the author's skepticism isn't entirely unfounded, but that doesn't mean they can just dismiss her symptoms. The key here is trust in a relationship. If the girlfriend says she has these intolerances, the author is questioning her honesty. Even if their intentions are good (wanting her to have a more varied diet), doubting her health claims can be harmful.\n\nAlso, the friends' suggestion to secretly test her by giving her the foods without her knowledge is definitely crossing a line. That's a breach of trust, and the author is right to avoid that. However, the author's approach of \"probing\" and urging her to try the foods again might still be problematic. It's one thing to have concerns and another to push someone to consume things that make them unwell. The girlfriend might feel pressured or not supported if her partner isn't respecting her dietary needs, even if there's doubt.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the author should be more supportive and encourage her to seek a second medical opinion instead of questioning her directly. That way, they address the health concern without undermining her trust. The fact that the author is worried about trust lines shows they care about the relationship, but their methods might be causing issues.\n\nSo, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they have valid concerns, but their approach could be better. However, in relationships, trust and support are crucial. Constantly doubting a partner's health issues, even if well-meaning, can damage trust. The answer might be A (they're in the wrong) because they're not respecting her autonomy and health choices, but I need to check if there's a balance here. The line is thin between concern and overstepping.\n"
