As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's food intolerances. The situation is that the girlfriend claims to have gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. He's heard stories about parents falsely diagnosing their children, so he's skeptical. He's been trying to get her to test these intolerances again, even suggesting sneaking her food with those items to see her reaction. But he's conflicted because he doesn't want to cross trust lines.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Doubting a partner's health issues can be a sensitive area. On one hand, the author is concerned because he thinks this might be restricting her unnecessarily. On the other hand, challenging her claims without her consent could damage trust. The girlfriend might feel that his skepticism is dismissive of her health and experiences.\n\nThe key points here are the author's actions versus intentions. He's trying to help by encouraging her to test the intolerances again, but the method of sneaking food without her knowledge is a red line. Trust is crucial in relationships, and doing something behind her back, even with good intentions, could be seen as a betrayal.\n\nAlso, the author should consider that self-diagnosed food intolerances are common, but it's also possible that she genuinely has developed these issues. Instead of covertly testing, a better approach would be to support her in consulting a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis. That way, both can address the issue without undermining trust.\n\nThe friends' suggestion to spike her food is unethical, as it's deceptive and could cause harm. The author rightly thinks that's crossing a line, so that shows he's aware of the potential consequences. However, his skepticism might lead him to make assumptions about her honesty, which could be hurtful.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong for having doubts, but his methods of addressing them (like proposing to spike food) are problematic. The right approach is to encourage professional evaluation rather than personal experimentation. So the answer would be B (No), but with the caveat that his approach needs to be more respectful and honest.\n"
