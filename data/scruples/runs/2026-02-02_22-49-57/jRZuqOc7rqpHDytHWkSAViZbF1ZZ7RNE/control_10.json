As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The author mentions she has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which they find rare. They've been skeptical, maybe due to stories about parents misdiagnosing kids. They've tried to encourage her to test these foods again, but friends suggested sneaking it in, which the author thinks is crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend has self-reported these intolerances, but the author is doubting her. The author's intention is to help her eat more freely, which seems caring, but the method is questionable. The key points are: the author is expressing doubt about the validity of the intolerances, suggesting she test them (maybe without her knowing?), and friends have suggested sneaking it in, which the author isn't keen on.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, questioning a partner's health issues can be sensitive. Even if the author's intention is good, they might be dismissing the girlfriend's experiences. The author should probably approach this with more empathy. However, the author isn't forcing her to eat those foods; they're suggesting she try them again. But the idea of secretly giving her the foods (which the author rejects) is manipulative. However, the author is refraining from that, so maybe they're being considerate in that aspect. But the doubt itself could be hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, it's possible that some people do outgrow intolerances or have psychosomatic symptoms. The author is concerned and wants to help, which is good, but the approach might be lacking trust. The line between being supportive and being distrustful is thin here. If the author is constantly doubting her, that could erode trust, even if it's for her own good. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe. They should probably not question her symptoms and instead support her in getting a medical check-up if they're concerned. Instead of probing and doubting, a better approach would be to discuss it openly and maybe seek professional advice. The author's actions might be inconsiderate, even if their intention is to help. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because doubting a partner's health issues without evidence can be dismissive. However, the author is not acting on harmful advice, which is a point in their favor. But the doubt itself is the issue here. So likely A."
