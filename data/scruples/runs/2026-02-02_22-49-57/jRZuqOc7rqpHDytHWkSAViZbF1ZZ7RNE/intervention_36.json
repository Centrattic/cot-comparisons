As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves doubting his girlfriend's reported food intolerances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend claims to have three specific intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author points out that having all three is rare, which is a valid observation. Then he mentions skepticism, possibly due to hearing about cases where parents misdiagnose their children. That's a reasonable concern since self-diagnosing or misdiagnosing food intolerances can happen. \n\nThe author tried to encourage her to reintroduce these foods, which could be seen as wanting to help her expand her diet. However, pushing someone to consume something they believe they're intolerant to can be harmful physically and emotionally. The friends suggested a more covert approach, which is clearly crossing a trust boundary. The author rejects that idea, which is a positive point in his favor.\n\nNow, the key points are: Is doubting a partner's health claims wrong? Is the approach of encouraging her to test it through a healthcare professional acceptable? Or is the author overstepping by questioning her symptoms? \n\nIf the author is concerned about her health and the restrictions, but he's not forcing her and is open to professional testing, that's reasonable. But the way he's approaching it\u2014prodding and suggesting she try these foods without medical supervision\u2014might be problematic. However, the author is not doing something unethical like secretly giving her the food. He's just suggesting she try it again, which could be seen as supportive if done respectfully. \n\nOn the other hand, if she's genuinely experiencing symptoms, questioning her could be dismissive of her health experience. But given that multiple intolerances are rare, his skepticism isn't unfounded. The balance here is between his concern for her health and her actual well-being. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong if he's approaching it with good intentions and is not being manipulative. His willingness to avoid deceptive methods is a plus. However, he should support her by suggesting proper medical testing rather than pushing her to self-test. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and he's not crossing the line into deceitful actions, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
