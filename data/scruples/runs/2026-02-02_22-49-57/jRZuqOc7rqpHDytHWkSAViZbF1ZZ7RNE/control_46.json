As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. The situation is that the girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author thinks is rare. He's been skeptical and even tried to get her to test these things again. Friends suggested sneaking food with those ingredients, but he's against that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if doubting someone's health issues is wrong. Health issues can be real, even if they seem rare. The author's skepticism might stem from concern, but dismissing someone's legitimate health concerns can be hurtful. However, there's also the aspect of trust. The author is trying to help, but maybe in a way that's not supportive.\n\nThe girlfriend's conditions might not be as rare as he thinks. Some people do develop intolerances later in life due to various factors. The author's approach of encouraging her to try those foods again could be seen as dismissive if she's genuinely experiencing symptoms. Plus, suggesting to test without her consent (like friends' idea) would definitely be crossing a trust line. But the author says he's against that, so maybe he's trying to balance his concern with respect.\n\nHowever, even without sneaking, directly challenging her symptoms might not be helpful. It's important to support someone with dietary restrictions rather than doubting them. If he's concerned about the validity, maybe the right approach is to encourage her to see a healthcare professional for testing instead of pushing her to self-test. But the author hasn't done that yet; he's just prodding her to try the foods. That could come off as not believing her, which can strain the relationship.\n\nIn relationships, trust and support are key. If the author isn't believing in her health issues, that could erode trust. On the other hand, he might have valid concerns if she's misdiagnosed. But the way to address that is through proper channels, not personal challenges. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because he's doubting her health without professional validation, which can be harmful. But maybe there's a middle ground where he's just concerned. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since his actions involve doubting and trying to test without professional guidance, that's probably where the fault lies.\n"
