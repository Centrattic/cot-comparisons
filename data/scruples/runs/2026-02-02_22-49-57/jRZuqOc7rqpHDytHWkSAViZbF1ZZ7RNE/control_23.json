As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario involves doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend has three intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author mentions that these are rare and has been skeptical, referencing cases where parents might misdiagnose their children. They\u2019ve been trying to get her to test these foods again, suggesting that she might have developed them later. Friends suggested a more direct approach, but the author is hesitant about crossing trust boundaries.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The main issue is doubting someone's health claims. In a relationship, trust is crucial. If the girlfriend has been diagnosed by a healthcare professional, the author's skepticism could undermine her trust. Even if the author has valid concerns (like rare cases of misdiagnosis), the approach matters. Pressuring someone to consume foods they believe they're intolerant to could cause harm, both physically and emotionally.\n\nThe author is in a position where they should respect their partner's health decisions unless there's credible medical evidence to contradict her claims. The fact that the author is trying to get her to test these foods without her consent might be seen as disrespectful. The friends' suggestion to secretly give her the foods is definitely crossing a line, and the author is right to not follow that advice. However, the author's questioning and urging might still be problematic if done without support for her health.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern is understandable. They want their partner to have a better quality of life without restrictions. But the way to address this should involve open communication and possibly consulting a healthcare provider together, not pressuring or doubting her experiences.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they're questioning their partner's health without offering support and potentially undermining her trust. The correct answer could be A (Yes), but I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. However, the author isn't crossing the same line as the friends, but their doubt is still an issue. In AITA contexts, doubting someone's health issues without evidence is usually frowned upon. So the answer is A.\n"
