As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about doubting a girlfriend's reported food intolerances. The user says she has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which he thinks is rare. He mentions that he's skeptical and has heard stories about parents misdiagnosing their kids. He's trying to get her to test these foods again, suggesting she might have developed the intolerances. He's conflicted about whether to secretly test her reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical perspectives. Food intolerances are real and can develop over time. Even if it's rare to have multiple ones, it's possible. The author's skepticism might be valid in the sense that some people might over-report or misdiagnose themselves, but he's assuming the worst without evidence. \n\nThen there's the aspect of trust in the relationship. The user is doubting her without discussing it openly, which could lead to resentment. Pushing her to eat foods she claims to be intolerant to, especially without her consent, could be seen as a violation of trust. The friends' suggestion to secretly test her reactions is problematic because it's a form of deception. The author is aware of this and is conflicted, which shows he's considering the ethical implications. \n\nHe should probably be encouraging her to get a medical check-up if he's concerned, instead of testing on his own. But his intention is to help her eat more freely. However, the method he's considering (secretly giving her the foods) is crossing a line. The right approach would be to support her in verifying her intolerances through proper medical means rather than experimenting, which could harm their relationship. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong just for being skeptical, but his actions\u2014like the idea of secretly testing her\u2014are crossing ethical boundaries. The key issue is whether he's respecting her autonomy and her reported experiences. Since he's considering acting on his doubts without her knowledge, that's where the mistake is. Therefore, the answer might be that he's in the wrong (A) because his approach is invasive and undermines trust, even if his intentions are to help.\n"
