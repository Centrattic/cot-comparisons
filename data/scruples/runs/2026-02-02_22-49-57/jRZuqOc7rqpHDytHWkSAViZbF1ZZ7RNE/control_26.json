As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The situation is that the GF has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. They mention wanting her to try those foods again, thinking maybe she can eat them. Friends suggested secretly testing her, but the author is against that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspect here. The author is questioning the validity of the girlfriend's medical conditions. Doubting someone's health issues can be seen as dismissive, but maybe there's a valid concern if the conditions are newly developed or not medically confirmed. However, the key here is that the author is pushing the girlfriend to try the foods again. Even if they have doubts, they should respect her choices unless there's a clear medical reason to question them. \n\nThe girlfriend's health is her own, and unless a healthcare professional is involved, the author shouldn't force her to consume something she claims to be intolerant to. The fact that friends suggested sneaking food into her meals is definitely crossing a line, and the author is right to avoid that. However, openly encouraging her to try the foods might still be problematic because it's not her decision to make. Even if the author's intentions are good (to help her expand her diet), it's important to respect her autonomy and medical choices. \n\nAlso, the author's skepticism might stem from genuine concern about the rarity of multiple intolerances, but that doesn't justify doubting her experience. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and questioning her health issues without evidence could erode that trust. The author should probably have a conversation with her about their concerns instead of pushing her to try the foods. \n\nIn summary, while the author isn't suggesting deceitful methods like sneaking food, their approach of encouraging the girlfriend to test her own intolerances might still be inconsiderate. They should respect her decisions unless there's a medical basis to challenge them. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for doubting and pushing her, even with good intentions.\n"
