As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The situation involves the girlfriend having multiple intolerances\u2014gluten, lactose, sugar\u2014which are rare. The author is skeptical because he's heard of cases where people are misdiagnosed or parents fabricate such conditions. He's tried to encourage her to reintroduce these foods but is conflicted about secretly testing her reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical validity. Gluten intolerance isn't the same as celiac disease, which is an autoimmune disorder. Lactose intolerance is common, but developing it later in life is possible. Sugar intolerance is less common. However, self-diagnosis is a real issue; people sometimes avoid foods without proper testing. The author's skepticism isn't unfounded if there's no medical proof, but how he's handling it matters.\n\nThe author's actions include probing and suggesting she try the foods again. Friends even suggest sneaking in gluten/lactose to see reactions, which he finds crossing a trust line. The key here is whether his doubt is justified and how he's addressing it. If he's causing her stress or undermining her health choices, that's problematic. But if he's genuinely concerned about her well-being and wants her to confirm the intolerances medically, that's different.\n\nTrust and respect are crucial in relationships. The author should be supportive, but it's okay to have questions if approached respectfully. However, pressuring her to consume foods she's avoiding could be harmful, especially if she's uncomfortable. The line is crossed if he's not respecting her choices or making her feel doubted without valid reason.\n\nMedical advice: It's always good to get proper testing for intolerances. If the girlfriend hasn't been tested, the author could suggest that instead of forcing her to eat the foods. Secretly testing her reactions is unethical and could damage trust. Open communication is better than manipulation.\n\nSo, the author's intent might be to help, but his methods (like suggesting secret testing) are wrong. Doubting without evidence is part of the problem, but his concern isn't entirely baseless. However, the way he's approaching it, especially the idea of sneaking food, is crossing a boundary. Therefore, he's partly in the wrong for not trusting her experience and for considering underhanded tactics. The answer is A (Yes).\n"
