As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances. The author finds this rare and is skeptical. He's heard cases where parents might falsely claim their kids have intolerances. He's been pushing her to try these foods again, thinking maybe she can eat them now. Friends suggested giving her these foods without her knowledge, but he thinks that's crossing a trust line.\n\nHmm. So, why does the author think it's a problem? Because he's questioning the validity of her conditions. But wait, is it his place to question her health? Even if he's concerned, he's not a medical professional. The girlfriend claims these intolerances, and she's the one experiencing the symptoms. The author's approach is to encourage her to eat the foods again, but that could be harmful if she's genuinely intolerant. Also, his friends suggested sneaking the foods into her meals, which he rightly thinks is a breach of trust.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust is key. If he's not trusting her about her health, that's a big issue. Even if his intentions are good, doubting her health issues without evidence can be seen as dismissive. Plus, developing intolerances later in life is possible. For example, some people develop lactose intolerance as they age, or due to other health factors. So, the rarity aspect might not be a strong argument here.\n\nThe author's actions could lead to her experiencing discomfort or health issues if his doubting is incorrect. There's also the emotional aspect\u2014making her feel like her health concerns aren't valid isn't healthy for the relationship. He should probably consult a healthcare provider instead of testing her himself. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's doubting her without evidence and pressuring her to eat things she avoids, that's problematic. Even if he's trying to help, it's not his place to question her health unless there's a medical reason. The answer here is AITA? AITA is \"Am I the Asshole?\" So, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Considering all that, the answer is A\u2014Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
