As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. The author is skeptical, having heard about cases where parents misdiagnose their children. They've tried to get her to reintroduce these foods into her diet, but some friends suggested more extreme measures, which the author is against.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's skepticism might stem from genuine concern, especially if they believe the intolerances are not real. However, questioning a partner's health issues can be sensitive. The author is encouraging her to test her reactions, which could be seen as supportive if done respectfully. However, pushing someone to consume things they're avoiding due to self-reported intolerances might not be the best approach, especially if it's causing stress.\n\nBut the author is not going as far as their friends' suggestions of secretly giving her the foods. They're trying to approach it openly. The real question is whether doubting a partner's health claims is wrong. If there's no medical evidence, it's one thing, but if the girlfriend has been diagnosed, the author should respect that. However, if the author has valid concerns about the diagnosis's validity, maybe due to lack of testing or consistency, they have a point. However, the way they're approaching it\u2014questioning and pushing for her to try the foods\u2014could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and health concerns, leading to AITA being \"A\" (they are the asshole). But if the author is genuinely concerned and not being malicious, it might be \"B\".\n\nWait, but the author is trying to help by encouraging her to test it. However, in doing so, they might be undermining her trust and her perception of her own health. The line between being supportive and being dismissive is thin here. Since the author isn't crossing the line by secretly testing (as their friends suggested), but is instead engaging in open discussion, maybe they're not in the wrong. But doubting her without evidence could be seen as dismissive. It's a bit of a toss-up. Maybe the answer is A because doubting without evidence can be hurtful, but B if they're approaching it constructively. Hmm. The answer likely leans towards A because the author is doubting her health claims, which can be seen as invalidating her experiences. So AITA would be A.\n"
