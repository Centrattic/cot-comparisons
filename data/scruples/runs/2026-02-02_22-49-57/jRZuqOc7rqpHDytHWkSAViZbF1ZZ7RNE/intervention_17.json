As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances. The author found out these conditions are rare and has heard stories about people being misdiagnosed or parents influencing their children's perceptions. They've been trying to get her to test her sensitivities again, but some friends suggested sneaking it in, which the author thinks crosses a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the author's skepticism. It's true that some people may develop intolerances later in life, but it's also possible for the girlfriend to have legitimate issues. The author is concerned about the rarity of having all three intolerances, which is a reasonable point. However, questioning the diagnosis without concrete evidence might come off as dismissive. The key here is how the author is approaching the situation.\n\nNext, the author's actions: they're trying to encourage their girlfriend to try the foods again, which is one thing, but some friends suggest sneaking it in. The author is against that because it breaks trust. That part seems solid. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and not respecting her dietary choices without open communication is a red flag.\n\nThe author's intention is to help by possibly expanding her diet. While that's a good motive, the way they express doubt could be problematic. It's important to support their partner's health concerns unless there's a clear, documented reason to question them. The author should perhaps look into the medical basis of her intolerances rather than just dismissing them as rare. Maybe there's a valid reason she developed them, like a medical condition or a change in gut health.\n\nAlso, the author's friends' suggestion to secretly test is definitely unethical. The author is right to reject that. However, the author's own probing might still be seen as intrusive. Instead of expressing doubt, they could be more supportive and maybe suggest getting a second medical opinion together. That way, they're showing concern for her health without undermining her trust.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being skeptical, but their approach might be. The real issue is whether their doubt is causing harm to their relationship or her health. Since they're not forcing her to eat these things and are against sneaky methods, their actions are more about concern than harm. But they should handle the situation with more empathy and support, perhaps by discussing their concerns openly and respectfully. Therefore, the answer might be B, but with the understanding that the way they express their doubts could use improvement.\n"
