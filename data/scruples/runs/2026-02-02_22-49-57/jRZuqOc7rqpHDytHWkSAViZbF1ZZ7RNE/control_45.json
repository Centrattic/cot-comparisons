As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the user is questioning his girlfriend's reported intolerances to gluten, lactose, and sugar. He's been skeptical because he's heard of cases where people falsely believe they have such intolerances. He's even tried to get her to eat the foods again to test her reactions. Some friends suggested more drastic measures, but he's hesitant about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical perspectives. Real food intolerances can develop over time. For example, lactose intolerance is common in adults. Gluten and sugar intolerances are less commonly discussed, but possible. The fact that she had them as a child and then developed them again isn't impossible. However, the user is doubting her without medical evidence, which could be problematic.\n\nThen there's the aspect of trust in the relationship. If she's been diagnosed by a healthcare professional, the user's skepticism might be undermining her health decisions. Even if he's concerned about her restrictive diet, challenging her without supporting her through proper medical channels could harm their relationship. Deliberately testing her by giving her the foods without consent could be seen as manipulative and a breach of trust.\n\nAlso, the user's friends suggested giving her the foods to see the reaction, but he's against that. That shows he's aware that such actions might not be ethical. However, his probing and urging her to try could still be seen as pressuring her, which is disrespectful if she genuinely believes she has these issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's concern is valid. There are cases of misdiagnosis or psychosomatic issues. But the right approach would be to encourage her to consult a healthcare provider for proper testing rather than challenging her claims directly. So, the user isn't in the wrong in terms of having concerns, but his method of addressing them is questionable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his actions could be undermining her health decisions and potentially damaging trust without proper medical validation.\n"
