As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. So, the girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author says are rare. They mention skepticism because they've heard about cases where people are told they're intolerant when they aren't, like with mothers influencing their daughters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has developed these intolerances since childhood, which is something to note. Intolerances can develop over time, so it's not impossible. The author is trying to push her to test these things again, but friends suggested sneaking gluten or lactose into her food. The author feels that's crossing a trust line.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. On one hand, questioning a partner's health issues can be sensitive. Medical conditions are personal, and doubting them without evidence can harm trust. Even if the author's intentions are good, the approach might be problematic. The author is expressing skepticism and potentially undermining the girlfriend's experience.\n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend's diet is severely restricted, the author might be concerned about her health or quality of life. But the way to approach this would be to support her in consulting a healthcare professional. The author shouldn't be testing her without her consent, as that could be seen as a breach of trust. The fact that the author is trying to encourage her to try these foods is one thing, but pressuring or tricking her is another.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's skepticism, their methods of probing, and the suggestion of friends to test without her knowledge. The line between concern and distrust is thin here. The author's doubt without evidence could be harmful, and pushing for tests without proper medical support isn't advisable. The answer likely is that the author is wrong because they're not respecting her reported symptoms and might be acting on their own suspicions rather than medical advice.\n"
