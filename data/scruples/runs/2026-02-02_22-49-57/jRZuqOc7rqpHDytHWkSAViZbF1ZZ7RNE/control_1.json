As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author is questioning their girlfriend's reported intolerances to gluten, lactose, and sugar. He says these are rare, which might be true, and he's skeptical because he's heard of cases where people were told they had intolerances when they actually didn't. He's trying to get her to test these things again, like eating gluten or lactose to see if she can tolerate them now. Some friends suggest secretly testing her, but he thinks that's crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. The author is doubting his girlfriend's health claims. While skepticism is natural, especially if the conditions are rare, how he's approaching it matters. He's trying to get her to try the foods again, which could be seen as supportive if he's doing it to help her, but if he's doing it to prove she's wrong, it's not. The key is his intent and the method. \n\nThen there's the issue of consent. If he were to give her food without her knowing (as his friends suggest), that's definitely a betrayal of trust. He's aware of this and refuses to do that, which is a positive point. But even suggesting she try the foods again could be problematic if she's genuinely ill. If she's experiencing symptoms, forcing or even encouraging her to consume something she believes she's intolerant to could cause harm, both physically and emotionally.\n\nAnother angle is the validity of the intolerances. If she has been diagnosed by a healthcare professional, then the author's skepticism might be unwarranted. Self-diagnosed intolerances are common, but if there's a medical basis, his doubt could be disrespectful. However, if the diagnosis was done without proper testing or by someone not qualified, his concern might have some merit. The problem is that he's not presented evidence that her diagnosis is incorrect; he's just doubting it based on rarity and some anecdotes.\n\nThe author's motivation matters. If he's doing this out of care and wanting to improve her quality of life, that's a good intention, but the approach needs to be respectful. If he's being dismissive of her health concerns, that's where he could be in the wrong. Trust in a relationship is crucial. Doubting her health issues without evidence can erode that trust, especially if she's experiencing genuine symptoms.\n\nAlso, the fact that she used to tolerate these foods but now can't might be a real medical change. Conditions like lactose intolerance can develop later in life. While it's possible she's mistaken, the author isn't presenting evidence to support his doubts. Instead, he's leaning on anecdotes, which isn't a strong foundation for questioning someone's health.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if he's right and she's not actually intolerant, pushing her to eat these foods without her consent could lead to physical discomfort and emotional distress. It's important to respect her choices and health decisions unless there's a clear, evidence-based reason to doubt them.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in a tricky spot. His skepticism is not entirely baseless, but his approach might be undermining his girlfriend's health and trust. The right approach would be to support her in getting a second medical opinion or proper testing to resolve the doubt without pressuring her to consume things she's avoiding. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting her health concerns and is pressuring her in a way that could harm their relationship.\n"
