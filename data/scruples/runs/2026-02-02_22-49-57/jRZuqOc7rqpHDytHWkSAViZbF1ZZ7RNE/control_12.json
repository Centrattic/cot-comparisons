As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about doubting his girlfriend's intolerances.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the scenario says. The guy has a girlfriend with gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances. He finds this rare and has heard stories where parents falsely claim their kids have such issues. Now he's trying to get her to test these foods again, thinking she might have developed them. His friends suggested sneaking the foods into her meals to see her reaction, but he's against that because he values trust.\n\nSo, the main points: Is he wrong for doubting her? Is pushing her to test the intolerances crossing a line?\n\nWell, the girlfriend has already self-diagnosed or been diagnosed with these intolerances. If she's been avoiding these foods and is experiencing symptoms when she consumes them, then she's probably right. Even if it's rare, it's possible. The author's skepticism might be unfounded. Also, suggesting she try gluten or lactose again could be harmful if she actually is intolerant. Introducing those foods without her consent, like his friends suggested, would definitely be a breach of trust. But he's against that, which is good.\n\nHowever, the author is trying to help by encouraging her to test her intolerances, which could be valid if he's concerned about her health or quality of life. But without her agreement, it's not his place to force or even suggest these tests. Trust in a relationship is key, and pressuring her to consume foods she avoids could damage that trust. Also, he's not the one who should be making decisions about her diet or health. That's her responsibility, unless there's medical evidence he's right.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's respecting her choices and not going behind her back, maybe not. But doubting her without evidence could be seen as dismissive. However, if she's been avoiding these foods for a while and she's not having symptoms, maybe he's right to question. But the answer hinges on whether he's respecting her autonomy. Since he's not going to sneak the foods, but is just suggesting she try them, perhaps he's not in the wrong. But if she's not open to it, pushing her might be inconsiderate.\n\nHmm. Medical conditions can be subjective, and unless there's a medical diagnosis, she might be self-diagnosing. But even then, if she believes she's intolerant and it's affecting her health, it's valid. The author's concern is about her quality of life. However, he should support her decision unless there's a medical reason to question it. So maybe he is in the wrong for doubting her without evidence and potentially undermining her health choices. But if there's a possibility she's misdiagnosed, maybe he's not in the wrong. It's a tricky balance between support and being a skeptic. I think the key is that it's her body, and he shouldn't force or pressure her to test it without her consent. So, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but he should approach it with more empathy and respect for her feelings and decisions.\n"
