As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario is about a boyfriend doubting his girlfriend's gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances. He's skeptical because it's rare and heard stories about parents faking it. He's trying to get her to test her intolerances again, maybe to see if she can eat them again. Some friends suggested sneaking it into her food, but he's against that.\n\nHmm. First, I need to determine whether the boyfriend's actions are justified or not. The key points here are his skepticism and the methods he's using. Doubting medical conditions can be tricky. On one hand, it's understandable to be concerned if something seems statistically rare. But on the other hand, people's bodies can change, and true allergies or intolerances are real. Also, there are cases of people being misdiagnosed or not properly diagnosed.\n\nHe's suggesting she try gluten or lactose again, which could be helpful if she's outgrowing them. But how is he approaching this? If he's pressuring her, that might not be good. The fact that she used to eat them as a child and developed the intolerances recently could mean a legitimate change in her body. It's possible for people to develop food intolerances later in life. So his skepticism might be valid, but he needs to approach it respectfully.\n\nThe friends suggest sneaking food into her diet, which he rightly thinks is crossing a trust line. That's good judgment. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for expressing his doubts and encouraging her to test. If he's being supportive and suggesting a medical test or a controlled trial with her, that's one thing. But if he's doubting her symptoms or not taking her concerns seriously, that's another. \n\nThe problem is that he's in a position where he's challenging her health claims. Even if his intention is to help, the way he's approaching it might undermine her trust. People with health issues often feel frustrated when others doubt their experiences. If he's not respecting her choice to avoid those foods, even if he's skeptical, that could be an issue. The key is trust and respect in the relationship. If he's acting out of concern but isn't respecting her decisions, he's in the wrong. If he's doing it in a supportive way, maybe not. But the post doesn't say he's being respectful. It says he's \"doubting\" and \"probing,\" which can be seen as dismissive. So the answer might lean towards AITA being the author is in the wrong (A). But maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAnother angle: The boyfriend is trying to help by encouraging her to test. If she has a valid intolerance, she might not want to test it without being sure. If she's not experiencing symptoms, maybe she's been avoiding unnecessarily. But if she's experiencing symptoms when she consumes those foods, then it's real. The issue here is whether his doubt is causing conflict. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) nature depends on whether his actions are respectful. If he's pressuring her to try without her consent, that's a problem. The fact that he's considering sneaky methods shows he's aware it's wrong, but his current approach is questioning her. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong because he's concerned but not acting recklessly, but maybe he should be more supportive. However, in relationships, doubting someone's health issues can be a big deal. So maybe he is in the wrong. I'm a bit torn. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer is either A or B. The key factors are: skepticism about a rare condition, suggesting controlled testing, not sneaking, but pressuring. If the girlfriend's symptoms are genuine, then doubting her could be harmful. If he's not respecting her dietary needs, that's an issue. The line is crossed if he's not believing her. So the answer might be A. Yes, he's in the wrong because he's not supporting her health choices and doubting her conditions. But if the conditions are possible (people can develop them), then maybe he's not. Hmm. I think in AITA cases, the community often looks at intent and respect. If he's acting out of concern but not respecting her decisions, it's a judgment call. But since he's doubting her medical conditions without evidence, that's usually seen as negative. So the answer is A.\n"
