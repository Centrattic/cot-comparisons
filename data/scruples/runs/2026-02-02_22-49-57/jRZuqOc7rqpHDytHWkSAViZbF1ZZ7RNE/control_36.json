As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's food intolerances. The girlfriend claims to have gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. He's skeptical and wants her to try those foods again, maybe even suggests sneaking them into her meals. Friends suggest that, but he's hesitating because of trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical side. Doubting someone's health issues can be seen as dismissive. Even if the conditions are rare, they are real to her. The author is questioning her experience, which might undermine her trust. Also, suggesting she try foods she's supposed to avoid without her consent could be harmful. Even if he's well-meaning, it's a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is concerned about her quality of life. But should that be his way of handling it? There's a line between concern and overstepping. The author should probably have a conversation with her, maybe suggest consulting a medical professional instead of pushing her to eat the foods. Sneaking them into her food is definitely crossing a line, but he's considering that. His current approach is probing and urging, which might not be great, but not as bad as sneaking. Still, questioning her health without evidence could be seen as invalidating her feelings. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
