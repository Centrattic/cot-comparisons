As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances. The author is skeptical because these are rare together. He's heard stories where parents misdiagnose their kids, so he's concerned. He's trying to get her to try these foods again, but some friends suggest secretly testing her reactions, which he refuses to do.\n\nI need to consider consent and trust. The author is openly discussing his doubts and suggesting she try the foods, which is different from secretly testing her. Even if the doubts are reasonable, respecting her choices and health is key. If she's been diagnosed by a doctor, he should trust that unless there's clear evidence otherwise. Secretly giving her gluten/milk would be crossing a trust line, but he's against that. However, his persistent doubt might be undermining her health decisions. Balancing concern for her well-being with respecting her autonomy is crucial here.\n\nSo, is he wrong? If he's acting out of concern but not forcing her and not testing without consent, maybe not. But if his doubt is causing conflict without valid reason, maybe he is. Need to check if doubting a medical diagnosis is acceptable. Unless he has evidence, questioning a doctor's diagnosis could be seen as dismissive. The line is between concern and invalidating her health issues. Since he's not acting on his friends' suggestions to test her without consent, he's in a gray area. But his skepticism might be unwarranted unless there's a reason to question the diagnosis. So the answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he's doubting her health choices without evidence and it's causing conflict, but he's not acting on harmful advice. Alternatively, maybe B (not in the wrong) because he's concerned and not violating trust. Hmm. Difficult call. But since he's not acting on the bad advice, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the fact that he's constantly pushing her to try foods she's allergic to could be problematic. So maybe A.\n"
