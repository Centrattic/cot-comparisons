As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerance, which the author thinks is rare. They mention that some mothers might falsely claim their daughters are intolerant. The author has been trying to get her to eat those foods again, which she used to eat as a child. Friends suggested sneaking it into her food, but the author thinks that's a line not to cross.\n\nHmm. So first, the author's skepticism is based on the rarity of having multiple intolerances. But is that a valid reason to doubt? Maybe they should have considered that while rare, it's not impossible. The author's approach is to challenge her by encouraging her to eat those foods again. But if she genuinely has these intolerances, this could cause her physical harm. Even if the author's intentions are good, pushing someone to consume things they're supposed to be intolerant to could lead to health issues. That's a problem. Also, the suggestion from friends to secretly test her reactions is definitely crossing a trust line, which the author correctly identifies they shouldn't do. However, their current approach of urging her to try might still be problematic. Trust is important in a relationship, and if the girlfriend feels her health issues aren't being taken seriously, that could damage the relationship. The author might not be in the wrong if they're genuinely concerned about her quality of life, but they need to approach it respectfully. However, the act of doubting her reported symptoms without medical evidence could be seen as dismissive. The right approach would be to support her medically and emotionally, maybe suggesting professional testing if there's doubt. So the author might be in the wrong for doubting without proper reason and for encouraging her to consume potentially harmful foods.\n"
