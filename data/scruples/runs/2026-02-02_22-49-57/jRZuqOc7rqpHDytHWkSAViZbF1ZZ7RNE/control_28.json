As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about doubting his girlfriend's reported food intolerances. So, the guy's girlfriend claims she has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the user says are rare. He's skeptical because he's heard stories of people being misdiagnosed or even parents faking it. He's tried to get her to test these foods again, but some friends suggested tricking her, which he's against.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if his skepticism is valid. While it's true that some people may misdiagnose themselves, it's also possible that she has legitimate intolerances. The user is questioning her claims, which might be seen as not supporting her. But he's not outright dismissing her, just being cautious. He's even considering a test by having her try the foods again, which is a reasonable approach if done consensually. However, his friends' suggestion to secretly test her is unethical, and he correctly sees that as crossing a trust line.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and respect. If the girlfriend has been open about her intolerances, even if he's skeptical, he should respect her choices unless there's evidence she's lying. Doubting her without proof can be hurtful. On the other hand, if he's concerned about her health, he could encourage her to get tested by a medical professional instead of trying to test her himself. The fact that he's considering a test but not the sneaky approach shows he's trying to be ethical. But is his doubt itself wrong?\n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's health choices is important. Even if he's right that she's misdiagnosed, pushing her to test without her consent could harm trust. The best approach would be to discuss his concerns openly and support her in getting a proper diagnosis. So, the user's actions might stem from concern, but doubting her without evidence and trying to force her to test could be seen as not respecting her autonomy. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not trusting her experience and for suggesting unsolicited tests.\n"
