As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a 7-month relationship with his girlfriend, who claims to have multiple intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author is skeptical because these are rare and has heard stories where parents might have misdiagnosed their kids. He's been probing her to try these foods again, suggesting she might have outgrown it. Friends have even suggested sneaking these foods to test her reactions, but he's against that. Now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author is doubting his girlfriend's health claims. While it's true that some people might have psychosomatic issues or misdiagnosed conditions, the author's approach might not be the healthiest. Questioning someone's health can come off as dismissive or undermining their experiences. Even if his intentions are good (wanting her to have a better diet), his method of probing might be causing stress or distrust.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's considering sneaking food into her diet is a red flag. That's a breach of trust. Even though he's against that idea, some of his friends suggested it. He's aware that's a line he shouldn't cross, which is a good sign, but his current approach of constantly questioning her condition might be similar in that it's not respecting her autonomy.\n\nAnother angle: he's in a 7-month relationship. It's possible he's not fully aware of her medical history. Maybe she actually has these intolerances, maybe not. But without proper evidence or consulting a medical professional, he's making assumptions. It's not his place to question her health unless there's a valid reason, and even then, the way he's approaching it might be harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, he's concerned and wants to help. His skepticism might stem from love and wanting to improve her life, but the way he's expressing that skepticism is potentially damaging. The key here is whether his actions are respectful. Probing and suggesting she try the foods again might be seen as dismissive. The line between concern and distrust is thin here.\n\nAlso, the rarity of multiple intolerances is a point he's making. However, while it's rare, it's not impossible. Assuming that because it's rare, she's lying might be a form of gaslighting. He should approach this with more empathy and perhaps encourage her to get a medical check-up rather than doubting her.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is being skeptical and possibly undermining his girlfriend's health claims, which could be seen as disrespectful. Even if his intentions are good, the way he's handling the situation is inconsiderate and could harm the relationship. So, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
