As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about doubting his girlfriend's reported intolerances to gluten, lactose, and sugar. He's skeptical because he's heard stories where parents might not be truthful about their kids' intolerances, and now he's trying to get her to test them again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has these three intolerances, which the author thinks are rare. The author is pressuring her to consume these foods again, maybe to prove she isn't actually intolerant. But he's also conflicted because some friends suggested sneaking it into her food, which he thinks would cross a trust line.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, questioning medical conditions isn't inherently wrong, but the way he's approaching it matters. If the girlfriend has been diagnosed by a healthcare professional, then doubting that without evidence could be problematic. However, if there's no medical proof, the author might be right to be cautious. But he's actively trying to get her to reintroduce these foods, which could be harmful if she genuinely has intolerances. That's risky. Also, the part about friends suggesting to give her food without her knowledge is definitely crossing a line, and he's right to avoid that. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend's restrictions are causing significant stress or limiting her life, the author's concern is understandable. But the approach of pressuring her to test it again might not be respectful of her health decisions. It's a balance between supporting her choices and ensuring she's not being misinformed. If the author isn't in the medical field, he might not have the authority to question her health decisions. Trust is a big part of a relationship, and constant doubt could erode that. \n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting her health choices and is pushing her to take risks. Alternatively, if her conditions aren't properly diagnosed, he's right to be skeptical. But the key here is that the girlfriend's well-being is at stake. If she's truly intolerant, his actions could lead to her health issues. The fact that she used to consume these foods as a child but now can't is strange, but that doesn't mean she's faking it. Medical conditions can develop over time. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be overstepping by not respecting her dietary restrictions and pressuring her to consume things that could harm her if she's telling the truth. Even if his intentions are good, the method is problematic. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
