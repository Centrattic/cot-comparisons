As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's food intolerances. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has three intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author finds it rare and is skeptical, maybe because he's heard of cases where parents misdiagnose their children. He's trying to get her to test these foods again, thinking she might have developed the intolerances later. His friends suggest secretly giving her the foods to see her reaction, but he's against that because it's crossing a trust line.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. Well, the girlfriend has self-reported these intolerances, but the author is questioning them. It's important to consider that real food intolerances exist, even if they develop later in life. So, questioning the validity isn't necessarily wrong, but the approach matters. The author is trying to encourage her to test them openly, not secretly. That's good because he's respecting her trust. His motivation is to help her have a less restricted diet, which is caring. However, he should also consider that her symptoms might be real and not just psychosomatic or imagined. Maybe he's being dismissive without evidence. But he's not secretly testing her, which is a positive. So, is he in the wrong? If he's respectful and not causing harm, maybe not. But if he's being dismissive of her health without proof, that could be an issue. The key points are: he's not crossing trust by not doing secret tests, he's trying to support her, but his skepticism could be undermining her. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because he's seeking a solution without violating trust, but maybe there's a balance. However, in such situations, supporting the partner's health concerns even if you're skeptical is important. If he's not respecting her experience, he could be wrong. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. But since he's not acting on the suggestion to secretly test and is instead trying to discuss it with her, maybe he's not in the wrong. So I think the answer is B (No).\n"
