As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about doubting his girlfriend's gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances. They've been together for 7 months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The GF has multiple intolerances, which the author finds rare. He's skeptical because he's heard stories about parents misdiagnosing their children. He's trying to get her to test these foods again, which she used to eat as a child. His friends suggest sneaking gluten/lactose into her food, but he doesn't want to cross that trust line.\n\nNow, the key points here are about doubt and trust. The author is questioning her health conditions. Even if he's concerned about her diet, his approach could be seen as undermining her. Medical conditions are personal, and without her consent, suggesting she test these things could be seen as dismissive. It's important to respect her experience of her own body. Even if there's a chance she's misdiagnosed, it's not his place to challenge her unless she's open to it. The fact that he's bringing up friends' suggestions but refusing to do it shows he knows it's a trust issue. So, the main issue here is whether his doubt is justified or if he's overstepping by trying to test her. \n\nIn relationships, trusting each other's health concerns is crucial. Unless there's evidence of faking, doubting without support could harm trust. Even if the intolerances are rare, they exist, and his approach might be dismissive. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's doubting her health without evidence and possibly violating trust.\n"
