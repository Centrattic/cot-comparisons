As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has three intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author is skeptical because he's heard about cases where people, like mothers, might falsely claim their kids have intolerances. He's trying to get her to eat those things again, thinking maybe she can now. He's considered sneaking it into her food but thinks that's crossing a trust line.\n\nHmm. The key points here are doubt, intent, and boundaries. The author is questioning her legitimate health issues. Even if he's right in some cases (like people faking), he's acting on his doubts without clear evidence. Encouraging her to eat things she's allergic to could be dangerous. But he's not doing it secretly, which is a good sign. However, his doubt itself might be undermining her trust in him. Also, the fact that she used to tolerate these things as a child makes him question it more, but that doesn't mean his doubt is justified.\n\nHealth issues are personal, and even if he's concerned about restrictions, the right approach is to support her decisions unless there's a medical reason to question. He should consult a healthcare professional instead of trying to test her. Sneaking food into her diet without consent is definitely wrong, but he's not doing that. However, pressuring her to try foods she avoids could still be harmful, especially if an intolerance is real. \n\nI think the main issue is that he's doubting her condition without evidence, which could be seen as dismissive. It's important to respect her health choices unless there's proof it's not valid. So, the author is in the wrong because he's not supporting her health choices and is acting on his suspicions instead of trusting her. Answer A.\n"
