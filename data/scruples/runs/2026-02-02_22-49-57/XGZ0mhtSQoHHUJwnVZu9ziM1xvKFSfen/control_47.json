My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he has two sons, an 8-year-old and a 14-year-old, and he lives with his girlfriend. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She got upset and called him an asshole. Now, after some feedback from Reddit, he decided to talk to his oldest son (the 14-year-old) about how he perceives the situation, including his thoughts on the girlfriend and his mother (the boys' mom) being away. The girlfriend found out and is furious, saying he undermined her and lacks confidence in her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. He wanted to understand his son's feelings about the living arrangement and the new situation with the girlfriend. That seems like a reasonable concern as a parent. He mentions that he was advised before that the kids might pick up on the tension, so checking in with them makes sense. However, the girlfriend is upset because he discussed her with the son without her knowledge. \n\nNow, is it wrong to talk to your child about their caregiver? Well, kids do need to feel comfortable talking to their parents about various aspects of their lives. If the son had negative feelings towards the girlfriend, addressing that could help the child feel supported. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her privacy or authority as a step-parent is being challenged if the child is discussing her in a negative light. \n\nThe key points here: Did the author have the right to talk to his son about the girlfriend without her consent? The author argues that as a parent, he needs to communicate with his children about their well-being. The girlfriend sees this as undermining her. But isn't it the parent's responsibility to ensure the child's emotional state? If the child is happy, then maybe the conversation was unnecessary, but if there were issues, it's important to address them. \n\nThe author says the conversation was about both the mother being away and the girlfriend. So maybe he was just getting the child's perspective on the entire situation. The girlfriend's reaction might be over the top because she feels her position is being questioned. However, the father is not criticizing the girlfriend directly through the child; he's just seeking the child's opinion. \n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend left the house and said she needs to rethink the relationship. That's a strong reaction. The father might have overstepped if he questioned the child with a critical mindset towards the girlfriend, but the post says the aim was to check in on the child's well-being, not to criticize the girlfriend. \n\nIn terms of parental rights versus the girlfriend's feelings, parents typically have the right to discuss their child's environment with them. Unless there's a custody agreement or court order, the father can talk to his kids. The girlfriend is a cohabiting partner but not a legal parent, so her expectations about privacy might not be as strong as the parent's. \n\nSo, the author's actions seem justified from a parental standpoint. He's ensuring his child's emotional health. The girlfriend's reaction, while hurtful, might stem from insecurity or miscommunication. The father isn't in the wrong for talking to his son about his feelings towards the people in his life, including the step-parent. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
