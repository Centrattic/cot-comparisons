My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a dad who lives with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to her being upset. Now, the author talks to his oldest son (14 years old) about how the kid perceives the girlfriend and his mother. The girlfriend finds out and gets really angry, thinking he's undermining her.\n\nThe author's main point is that he needed to talk to his son to understand how the kids are feeling, especially after other people suggested the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of commitment. He didn't do it to undermine her, he says, and the conversation was also about the mom who's away. The girlfriend took it as a betrayal and left.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, parents usually have the right to talk to their kids about family dynamics. The issue is whether the son is old enough to have such a conversation and if the father should have discussed the girlfriend's role with the child. The father's intention was to check in on his son's feelings, which is a responsible thing for a parent to do. However, maybe the girlfriend felt her authority was being questioned, especially if she's the primary caregiver now. But the father is also responsible for his children's well-being and ensuring they're okay. Since the son is 14, he's a teenager and can have these discussions. The father didn't do it to criticize the girlfriend but to assess the kids' feelings. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but the father's action seems justified. So I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
