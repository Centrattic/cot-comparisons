My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a 44-year-old dad, lives with his girlfriend and his two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She got upset and called him an asshole. Then he talked to his oldest son to see how he felt about the situation, including how he perceives the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really angry, saying he undermined her and betrayed her, leading her to leave the house.\n\nThe author is asking if he's the asshole. The user thinks he's not, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents should be concerned about their children's well-being, including their feelings about new partners. The author wanted to check in with his son to make sure the arrangement is okay, which seems reasonable. But the girlfriend took it as a personal attack, feeling undermined. \n\nSo, is talking to your child about their perception of a step-parent or partner wrong? It depends on how it's done. If the parent approached it objectively and without bad intent, it's probably a valid step. The author's intention was to ensure the kids are okay, not to criticize the girlfriend. He mentioned the conversation was as much about the son's mother being away as about the girlfriend. That's probably a good point because he's balancing the discussion.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is extreme. She claims he has no confidence in her and acts like a 6-year-old. But if the author didn't go to the child to undermine her, just to understand the kids' feelings, then he's acting in their best interest. Parents should be able to talk to their kids about their lives without needing permission from a partner. \n\nBut maybe there's a way to approach it that's more considerate. For example, discussing the topic with the girlfriend first to see if she feels comfortable with the conversation. But the author might not have known to do that. The key here is intent. The author's intent was not malicious. He had a valid reason to talk to his son. The girlfriend's overreaction might be due to insecurity or feeling threatened. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's fulfilling his duty as a parent to check in with his child. The girlfriend's reaction is harsh, but that doesn't make the author an asshole. He's trying to do the right thing by his kids. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
