My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves the author's girlfriend being upset because he discussed her with their son without her knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has two sons, ages 8 and 14. The older son, 14, was asked about his feelings towards his mother (the ex) and the girlfriend. The author's intention was to check in with the kids and make sure they're adjusting well, especially since the girlfriend took over the responsibility of picking up the kids from school. The girlfriend reacted strongly, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author's right to communicate with their child about family matters vs. the girlfriend's feelings. Parents typically have the right to talk to their children about various aspects of their lives, including family dynamics. The author didn't do it to criticize the girlfriend but to understand the kids' perspectives. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt disrespected or not trusted. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions were in the child's best interest and to ensure the child's well-being. As a parent, they have a responsibility to engage with their children about important family changes. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling criticized, but the author wasn't attacking her; they were seeking the child's input. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have discussed with the girlfriend first. However, the scenario doesn't mention prior communication attempts. Also, the author mentions that the conversation was about both the mother's absence and the girlfriend, so it wasn't one-sided. The girlfriend's decision to leave the house and question the relationship seems extreme given the context. \n\nIn terms of parental rights, parents can discuss their relationships with their children. The girlfriend might be overreacting, but the author's actions were justified. The main issue is whether the author overstepped, but based on the information, it's a necessary conversation for a parent to have. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
