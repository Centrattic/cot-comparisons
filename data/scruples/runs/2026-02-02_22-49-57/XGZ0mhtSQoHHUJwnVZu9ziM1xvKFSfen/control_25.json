My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (a father) talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, thinking he undermined her and lacks confidence in her. The author is wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The father has two sons, an 8-year-old and a 14-year-old. He's living with his girlfriend, who recently lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to conflict in the previous post. Now, he sat down with his oldest son (14) to discuss how the son feels about his mother being away and about the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is extremely upset, feeling betrayed and that he doesn't trust her. She left the house to stay with a friend and wants to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe author argues that talking to his son is necessary to ensure the child's well-being and that he didn't do it to undermine the girlfriend. He also mentions that the conversation was also about the mother being away, not just the girlfriend. He's frustrated that his girlfriend is overreacting and sees this as a high school drama issue.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. From a parenting perspective, talking to your child about their feelings about family members is generally considered appropriate. Parents have a responsibility to understand how their children feel about their living situation, especially when there are changes like a parent moving out and a new partner being involved. The father's intention was to check in on his son's emotional state, which is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is also important. She might feel that discussing her in front of the child could affect the child's perception of her, especially if the child expresses any negative feelings. The key here is whether the father's actions were done in a way that respected his girlfriend's boundaries. If he didn't discuss this with her beforehand and his son's comments were negative, that could be problematic. But in this case, the son was happy with the situation, so maybe the father's actions weren't harmful.\n\nBut the girlfriend's feeling of being undermined is a red flag. Even if the father's intent was good, the girlfriend might see it as a lack of trust. In relationships, communication is key. The father might have should have talked to his girlfriend first about his intentions to discuss her with the child, to set expectations and avoid hurt feelings. However, the father's argument is that he needed to talk to his children to ensure their well-being, which is a parent's duty.\n\nThis is a bit of a gray area. On one hand, parents should monitor their children's feelings about their family. On the other, involving a partner in such discussions without prior communication can cause tension. The question is whether the father overstepped by discussing the girlfriend with the child without her knowledge. But since the son was positive, maybe it's okay. Alternatively, the girlfriend's reaction might be a sign of insecurity or control issues in the relationship.\n\nIn terms of the children's well-being, the father's actions were appropriate. But the way he handled it without considering his girlfriend's feelings could have been better. However, given that the son was happy and the father's primary role is to his children, maybe he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's overreaction might be her issue, not his. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance where better communication could have been used.\n"
