My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author, a father, talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset and accused him of undermining her. The author argues that he needed to talk to his son without prior clearance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has two kids and is in a relationship with his girlfriend. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and there seems to be some tension around her role in the household. The author had a conversation with his son to check in on how the kids feel about the living arrangement and the girlfriend. The girlfriend took it as a betrayal, feeling undermined.\n\nNow, the key points here: Is it wrong for a parent to talk to their child about their family dynamics, including their perception of a step-parent or partner? On one hand, the author is fulfilling his role as a parent by checking in on his son's feelings. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels her authority or position is being challenged by discussing her with the child.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that the conversation was not just about the girlfriend but also about the son's mother being away. So it's a broader discussion about the family situation. However, the girlfriend's reaction is intense, comparing the author's maturity to a 6-year-old. The author is an adult and should be able to make decisions about parenting without needing his partner's permission. \n\nHowever, communication styles might matter. Did the author approach the conversation in a way that could be seen as critical of the girlfriend? The post says the son had valid thoughts and was happy, so maybe the conversation was neutral. But the girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the child without her consent is a breach of trust. \n\nIn many relationships, partners might expect some level of consultation, especially when children are involved. But the father has a duty to his children's well-being. The question is whether discussing the children's views of a stepparent requires the partner's approval. Legally and ethically, parents have the right to talk to their children about family matters without needing permission from a partner. \n\nBut there's also the emotional aspect. Even if it's justified, the way the conversation was handled might have triggered the girlfriend. Maybe the author should have discussed the intent with his girlfriend beforehand to avoid misunderstanding. However, the author might have felt it was necessary to do it without prior consultation to get an honest answer from the child.\n\nSo, weighing the need for a parent to discuss their children's feelings versus the partner's feelings. The father's action is justified as part of his parenting role. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling undermined, but that doesn't necessarily make the father wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He had a valid reason to talk to his son, and as a parent, he should have the right to discuss family matters with his children without needing his partner's permission. The girlfriend's reaction is a personal issue, but the father's action isn't inherently wrong.\n"
