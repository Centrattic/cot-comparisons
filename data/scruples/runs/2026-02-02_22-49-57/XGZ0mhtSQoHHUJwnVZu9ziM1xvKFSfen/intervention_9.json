My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The author is a 44-year-old man living with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend lost her job and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which she didn't appreciate. Then, after getting advice from Reddit comments that the kids might sense her reluctance, he talks to his oldest son about how he views the situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend finds out and gets really upset, feeling undermined and accused of not having confidence in her. She left the house and said she needs to rethink the relationship.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for talking to his son about his girlfriend. The key points here are the author's intention versus the girlfriend's reaction. The author's intention was to check on his son's well-being, considering the advice he received. He mentions that the conversation was also about the mother (the kids' other parent) being away and the girlfriend's role. The girlfriend felt betrayed and that her position was undermined. \n\nIn terms of legal or ethical wrong, it's not about breaking laws but about social norms and relationships. The author is a parent, so talking to his children about their guardian figures is part of his parental responsibility. However, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the kids without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if there's an expectation of privacy. The author didn't consult her before the conversation, which could be a point of contention. \n\nBut the author argues that he's an adult and needs to be able to talk to his kids without prior approval. The problem arises from the girlfriend's perspective; she might feel that the conversation was a reflection of the author's lack of confidence in her ability to care for the children. The fact that she left and wants to reevaluate the relationship shows the emotional impact. \n\nHowever, the author's action was in the interest of the children's emotional state, based on prior feedback. The issue here is the method and communication. Maybe the author should have discussed his concerns with the girlfriend first, even if he wanted to talk to the kids. But if the kids are his primary responsibility and he's allowed to address their needs, then it's within his rights. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but her feelings are valid. The author's intention was good, but not considering her feelings could be a social faux pas. The answer depends on whether the conversation was necessary and if there was a better way to approach it. Since the author is the parent, it's reasonable for him to talk to his kids, but not involving the other parent in the discussion might have been a mistake. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but he could have handled it better by including the girlfriend in the discussion or explaining the concern first. The key is that the children's well-being is a priority, but the approach could have been more considerate. Therefore, the answer is B (No), but with the caveat that communication between the adults could be improved.\n"
