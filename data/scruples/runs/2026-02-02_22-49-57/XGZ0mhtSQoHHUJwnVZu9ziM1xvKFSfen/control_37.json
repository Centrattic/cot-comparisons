My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the father) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The father lives with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school. She reacted negatively, calling him an asshole. The father then talked to his oldest son (14 years old) about how the son feels about the girlfriend and the situation. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and that he lacks confidence in her.\n\nSo, the key points here are the father's actions. He had a conversation with his son about his feelings towards his parents and the girlfriend. The girlfriend interprets this as the father not trusting her and undermining her. The father argues he needed to check in with his son's well-being.\n\nFrom a parenting perspective, it's common and necessary for parents to talk to their children about family dynamics, especially when there are changes (like a new partner living in the house or a parent moving out). The father's intention was likely to ensure his son felt supported and comfortable. However, the girlfriend feels it's an overstep because she wasn't consulted or informed beforehand.\n\nNow, considering boundaries between co-parents and partners. The father and girlfriend are in a relationship, but they're not married. The father has children from a previous marriage. The girlfriend might feel that the father is discussing her in front of the kids without her knowledge, which could affect how the kids perceive her. But the father is also responsible for his children's emotional health.\n\nThe question is whether the father overstepped by discussing the girlfriend in a one-on-one setting with his son. The father's argument is that he's a parent and needs to talk to his children. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be about feeling disrespected and not trusted.\n\nIn many cases, parents do discuss new partners with their children, especially if the partner is living in the household. However, the way the conversation was handled might be an issue. If the father didn't involve the girlfriend in the discussion or consider her perspective, that could lead to conflict. But the father's responsibility to his children's well-being is a key factor here.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. She left the house and wants to rethink the relationship. That's a heavy response to a conversation between a parent and child. It's possible the father didn't need to clear the conversation with her first, as it's a parent's role to check in with their kids. However, maybe there's a communication issue between them, where the father didn't consider how the girlfriend might react.\n\nIn summary, the father's action was to ensure his son's feelings were considered. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but the father isn't necessarily wrong for talking to his son. He's fulfilling his parental duties. However, there's a need for better communication between him and his girlfriend. But in terms of right or wrong in the action itself, the father isn't in the wrong.\n"
