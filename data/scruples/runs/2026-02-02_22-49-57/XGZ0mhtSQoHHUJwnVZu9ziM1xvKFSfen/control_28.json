My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The author's girlfriend is upset because she feels undermined and that he lacks confidence in her. The author's intention was to check in on his kids' feelings, especially after previous feedback about the kids sensing the girlfriend's reluctance to be around them. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has a duty as a parent to ensure his children's well-being, which includes understanding how they feel about the people in their lives, including the new partner. It's reasonable for a parent to talk to their kids about their relationships and how those relationships affect the children.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense, claiming betrayal and needing to rethink the relationship. That's a strong response. But is the author in the wrong? Well, parents should have autonomy in discussing their children's feelings without needing permission from a partner. The conversation was about the children's experiences, not directly criticizing the girlfriend, as per the author's statement.\n\nHowever, the author should also consider how to approach these conversations. Maybe discussing the girlfriend in front of the son could make her feel targeted. But the author's main concern was the kids' well-being. The key here is whether the conversation was appropriate. Since the author didn't go to the son to undermine the girlfriend and the conversation included other topics (like the mother being away), it seems the author's intention was valid.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be valid if she felt disrespected, but the author's action was a normal part of parenting. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The author isn't wrong for prioritizing his children's emotional health and seeking their input.\n"
