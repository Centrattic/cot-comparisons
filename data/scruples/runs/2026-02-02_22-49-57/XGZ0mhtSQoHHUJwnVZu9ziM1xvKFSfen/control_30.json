My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he lives with his girlfriend and his two sons. His girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She was upset about that and called him an asshole. Now, he's talking to his oldest son about how the son perceives his mom (the author's ex?), the current girlfriend, and maybe their living situation. Then the girlfriend found out and got really angry, saying he undermined her and didn't have confidence in her, leading her to leave the house and reevaluate the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, he's a parent with two kids, which means he's responsible for their well-being. He was concerned about the kids' perception of the girlfriend after reading comments on his previous Reddit post. That suggests he's trying to be a good parent and ensure the kids are okay. He had a conversation with his son to check in on how they feel. But the girlfriend interpreted this as undermining her. \n\nIs it wrong for a parent to talk to their child about how they perceive the people in their lives, especially when there are concerns about the child's adjustment? Parents often discuss such things to address any issues and make sure the child is comfortable. The author didn't go to the son to criticize the girlfriend directly but to get the kid's thoughts. However, the girlfriend's reaction is strong, implying that the author didn't consult her before talking to the son. \n\nIn a relationship, communication is key. The girlfriend might feel that her feelings or position in the family weren't considered. Even if the author's intent was to check on his son's well-being, if he didn't discuss it with his girlfriend first, she might see it as a lack of trust. But at the same time, a parent should have the right to talk to their children about their home life and relationships. \n\nThe author mentions that the conversation was about both his ex-wife and his current girlfriend. So maybe he was trying to balance the discussion. But the girlfriend might feel that he's comparing her to the ex or taking the son's side. The key points here are: the author's duty as a parent versus the girlfriend's feelings about being discussed without prior consultation. \n\nIs there a standard about whether parents should discuss their partners with their children? It's not always clear. If the parent is concerned about the child's adjustment, talking to them privately is reasonable. But if the partner is in the house and part of the family dynamic, the parent might consider involving the partner in such discussions, especially if it's about perceptions. However, the parent's primary responsibility is to the child. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. Leaving the house because the author talked to his son about her could be seen as overreacting. But maybe there's more context. The author had previously asked the girlfriend to take on responsibilities, and she had already been upset. Now, this conversation with the son might have triggered her insecurities. \n\nThe author's stance is that he's an adult and should be able to talk to his kids without permission. That's a valid point because parents have the right to parent. But if the conversation could impact the relationship, maybe some communication with the girlfriend would have been better. However, the author didn't have a malicious intent. He was trying to be a responsible parent. \n\nSo, the author's actions, while perhaps not communicated with the girlfriend, were taken in the interest of his child's well-being. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but the parent's responsibility to the child takes precedence. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
