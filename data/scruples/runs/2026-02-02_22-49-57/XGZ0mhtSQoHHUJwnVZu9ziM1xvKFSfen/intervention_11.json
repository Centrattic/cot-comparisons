My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a dad in a new relationship with a girlfriend. He has two sons, aged 8 and 14. His girlfriend recently lost her job, so he's supporting her. He asked her to help with the kids after school a few days a week, which led to her calling him an asshole. Then, after some Reddit comments, he decided to talk to his oldest son about how he feels about the new girlfriend. The son was okay with things. But the girlfriend found out and got really upset, saying he undermined her and lacked confidence in her. She left the house and wants to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe author is asking if he's the asshole. He feels he's not because he needed to talk to his kids without asking permission. But the girlfriend is upset. \n\nSo, the key points here are: talking to his son about the new girlfriend and the kids' feelings. The author's intention was to check in on the kids' well-being, not to undermine the girlfriend. The girlfriend feels undermined and betrayed. \n\nIs it wrong for a parent to talk to their child about their perceptions of the parent's new partner? Well, parents have a responsibility to know how their children feel about their family dynamics. The author did it after advice from others suggested that the kids might be affected by the girlfriend's behavior. He didn't mention the girlfriend to the child in a negative way, but discussed her as part of the child's environment.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014she feels her position is being attacked. So, maybe the issue is how the conversation was framed. If the author approached it neutrally, just to understand the child's perspective, it's reasonable. But if the child felt pressured to criticize the girlfriend, that could be bad. The author says the son had valid thoughts and was happy, so maybe the conversation wasn't negative. \n\nBut the girlfriend might feel that the parent is siding with the child against her, which could be seen as undermining her. However, as a parent, he has the right to discuss family matters with his children. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling that her role is being questioned. \n\nIs the author wrong? He had a legitimate reason to talk to his son. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but it's her choice to leave. The author isn't in the wrong for checking in on his child's well-being. Unless he did something specific to harm the girlfriend, which isn't mentioned here. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because a parent should be able to talk to their child about their family without needing permission.\n"
