My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a father living with his girlfriend and two sons, had a conversation with his oldest son about how the kid perceives the girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, felt undermined, and left the house. The author is wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's motivation was to check in with his son about how he's adjusting to the new family dynamic. The girlfriend recently lost her job and was taking on childcare responsibilities, which had caused some tension before. The author was advised by Reddit comments that the kids might pick up on the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm, so he wanted to address it by talking directly to his son.\n\nThe key points here are: the author was concerned about his children's well-being, initiated the conversation to understand their feelings, and didn't go to the kids to undermine the girlfriend. The girlfriend reacted strongly, feeling betrayed and that her position wasn't respected. \n\nNow, from a parental perspective, it's reasonable for a parent to talk to their children about family dynamics, especially when there are potential issues that could affect the kids. The author didn't badmouth the girlfriend; he wanted to ensure the kids felt supported and safe. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling insecure or not being communicated with first, but the author didn't have the intent to harm the relationship.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. She might feel that discussing her in front of the child could affect the child's perception of her, especially if the child is young. The author should consider discussing such topics with her first, but since the kids are his, it's also his right to talk to them about their home life. \n\nThe main question is whether talking to the child about the girlfriend is inappropriate. It's a gray area. While the author's intentions were good, maybe he should have included the girlfriend in the conversation first. But given that the children's well-being is a priority, and the author was acting on advice from others who care about the kids, it's not necessarily wrong. The girlfriend's overreaction might indicate deeper issues in their relationship, but that doesn't make the author the asshole here. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions were in the interest of his children's well-being, and he didn't have malicious intent. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
