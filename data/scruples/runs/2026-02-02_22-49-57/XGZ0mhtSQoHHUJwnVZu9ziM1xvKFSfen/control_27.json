My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a father living with his girlfriend and his two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which she took offense to. Now, he had a conversation with his oldest son (14) about how the son views his mother (the ex), the current living situation, and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author is arguing that he needed to talk to his son about these things without needing her permission, as part of being a parent.\n\nThe key points here are about parental rights versus the girlfriend's feelings. The author is a parent, so he has the responsibility to check in with his children about their well-being and their perceptions of their family dynamics. The son is 14, an age where such conversations are appropriate. The author's intent was to understand his child's feelings, not to undermine the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but the question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nNow, considering typical family dynamics: Parents should be able to talk to their children without interference from a partner. However, there's a line when the conversation directly involves the partner. The author didn't badmouth the girlfriend, but he did discuss her with the child, which the girlfriend took as a lack of trust. However, the kids' well-being is the parent's main priority. The girlfriend might feel that her role in the family is being questioned, but the father's action is part of his duty as a parent. Unless the conversation was malicious, the father isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction might be overblown, but that doesn't make the father responsible for her emotional response. So the answer is B\u2014author is not in the wrong."
