My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because she feels undermined and that the author doesn't have confidence in her. The author's reasoning is that he needed to talk to his kids about important family matters, including his girlfriend, since they live together and she's part of their lives. He didn't go to the son to undermine the girlfriend; the conversation was also about his ex-wife's absence.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, he's a parent who's concerned about his children's well-being and wants to know their thoughts on various family dynamics. It seems like a responsible action to check in with his kids, especially after receiving feedback that the girlfriend's behavior might affect the children. However, the girlfriend took it personally and felt betrayed, which might indicate communication issues in their relationship.\n\nNow, considering the key points: The author didn't share the conversation with his son to criticize the girlfriend. He was addressing multiple aspects, like the son's mother being away. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but relationships require mutual understanding. The author is a parent, so talking to his kids about their living situation and people in their lives is part of parenting. It's reasonable for a parent to discuss such matters with their children without needing to clear it with a partner first, unless there's a prior agreement otherwise.\n\nHowever, maybe the author didn't consider the girlfriend's feelings in advance. Even though the parent has a right to talk to their kids, approaching it in a way that's sensitive to the girlfriend's feelings could have mitigated the conflict. But the main issue is whether the author was wrong. Since the parent's actions were to ensure the kids' well-being and not to undermine the girlfriend, the answer leans towards B. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her feelings of insecurity rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n"
