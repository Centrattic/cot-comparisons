My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author has two sons, an 8-year-old and a 14-year-old. He's living with his girlfriend, and after a previous situation where his girlfriend lost her job and he asked her to pick up the kids, there was tension. Now, he's concerned about the kids' feelings, so he talks to his oldest son (14) about how the son feels about his mother being away, the new living situation, and his girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nThe main question is whether talking to his son about his girlfriend is wrong. From the author's perspective, he wanted to check in on his son's well-being and ensure the kids weren't being negatively affected. He didn't get the son's input before, so he felt it was necessary. The girlfriend, however, sees it as a lack of trust and confidence in her, leading her to leave the house.\n\nI need to consider both sides. As a parent, it's important to communicate with children to understand their feelings. But the girlfriend's reaction is also significant. Did the author have a right to talk to his son without consulting her? Maybe the approach could have been different\u2014perhaps discussing with the girlfriend first, but the author might not want to overburden her if there's existing tension. However, the girlfriend's feelings of betrayal suggest that the author didn't consider her position enough. In blended families, maintaining trust between partners is crucial. Even if the author's intent was good, the method might have been problematic. The girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the child in her absence is a breach of trust. The key here is whether the author's action was justified given the need to check on his son's well-being versus respecting the girlfriend's feelings. It's a tough balance, but since the author is the parent, he might need to prioritize his children's emotional health. However, the girlfriend's valid feelings of being undermined can't be ignored. The answer might hinge on whether the conversation was necessary and how it was handled. The author might not be in the wrong because he's fulfilling his role as a parent, but he might need to communicate better with his girlfriend to prevent such situations.\n"
