My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation is that the author lives with his girlfriend and his two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to a conflict. Now, the author had a conversation with his oldest son (14) about how the son feels about his mother being away, the current living arrangement, and his perception of the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author had a valid reason to talk to his son. As a parent, it's important to check in with children about their feelings and well-being, especially when there are changes in their family structure. The author mentions that previous comments suggested the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of willingness to be there for them, so the author wanted to confirm the son's perspective. That seems like a responsible action to ensure the child's emotional state isn't being negatively affected.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend feels that this conversation was an attack on her and that the author lacks confidence in her. The key issue here is whether talking to the child about the girlfriend is an overstep. The author clarifies that the conversation was not just about the girlfriend but also about the mother's trip and other things. But the girlfriend perceived it as undermining her. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics, the author is the parent, so he has a right to discuss family matters with his children. But the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in a way that could be critical or make her seem unreliable is inappropriate. The author didn't go to the son to criticize the girlfriend, but the act of talking to the child about the step-parent could be seen as a breach of trust if the parent and girlfriend had some understanding not to discuss such matters directly with the child without consulting the girlfriend first. However, since the author is the parent, he should have the autonomy to talk to his kids about family matters, especially when the children's well-being is a concern.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014leaving the house and saying she needs to rethink the relationship over a conversation with her stepson. But her perception is that she's being undermined, which is a common concern in step-parent situations. The author might not have considered how the girlfriend would feel about being discussed in this context, even if the intention was good. However, the author is justified in wanting to monitor his children's feelings towards their new parent figure.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's action is a parent checking in with his child, which is a normal part of parenting. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her sense of betrayal rather than the act itself. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but he might need to communicate better with his girlfriend to address her concerns. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's acting in the best interest of his children's emotional health.\n"
