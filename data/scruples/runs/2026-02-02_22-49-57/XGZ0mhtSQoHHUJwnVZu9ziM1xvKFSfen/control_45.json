My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 44-year-old man, lives with his girlfriend and his two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to her calling him an asshole. Then, after receiving feedback that the kids might be sensing the girlfriend's lack of willingness, he talked to his oldest son about how he perceives the girlfriend and their situation. The girlfriend found out and is now upset, feeling undermined and that he has no confidence in her. The author is wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue is whether talking to his son about the girlfriend was appropriate. The author's intention was to check on the kids' well-being and make sure they weren't being affected negatively by the girlfriend's situation. However, the girlfriend perceives this as a betrayal and a lack of trust. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is a parent, so his primary responsibility is to his children. Parents often need to discuss various aspects of their lives with their kids, including family members. But the girlfriend might feel that being discussed without her knowledge is a breach of trust, especially if the conversation was about her. \n\nThe question is whether the conversation was necessary and how it was approached. The author mentions that the conversation was also about the mother's trip and not just the girlfriend. But the fact that he discussed the girlfriend's role with the child could be seen as undermining her authority or presence in the household. However, from a parental perspective, ensuring the child's emotional state is important. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense\u2014leaving the house, saying it's a betrayal. That's a strong response. Maybe she feels that her relationship with the author should be private, and discussing her with the child without her input is a violation. On the other hand, the author is a parent and has a duty to consider his children's perspectives.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Perhaps the author could have discussed his concerns with the girlfriend first, but he might not have known about her feelings towards the kids until after the conversation. The original post mentioned that the previous AITA was about asking the girlfriend to take care of the kids, which she was upset about. The feedback suggested that the kids might be picking up on her lack of willingness, so the author acted on that advice.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention was to check on the kids' well-being, which is a parent's role. However, the method might have been problematic. If the conversation with the son was about the girlfriend's role without her knowledge, that could create tension. The girlfriend might feel that her position in the family is being judged without her input. \n\nBut the author isn't the child's parent, the mother is. The father is step-parent or co-parent? Wait, the original post's link isn't available, but the user says the previous post was about asking the girlfriend to watch the kids, leading to conflict. The sons are 8 and 14. The mother is away, so maybe the kids are with the father and his girlfriend. The author is the legal parent, so he needs to be involved in their upbringing. \n\nSo, the author talking to his son about how he perceives the girlfriend is part of parenting. However, the girlfriend might see it as a lack of trust. But the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to ensure the child's well-being. The girlfriend's reaction seems over the top, but maybe not entirely unjustified. The key is whether the conversation was necessary and how it was handled. \n\nIn terms of social norms, parents often discuss family dynamics with their children, including new partners. However, if the girlfriend was supposed to be a supportive figure, the child's perception is important. The author didn't do anything malicious, but the girlfriend's feelings are hurt. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author had a valid reason, but the girlfriend's reaction is intense. The answer might depend on whether the conversation was necessary and how it was approached. Since the author's main concern was the child's well-being, and given that he's the parent, it's more likely that he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's overreaction is her issue, but the author didn't act unreasonably.\n"
