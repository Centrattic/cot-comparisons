My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that he talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got really upset, feeling undermined. The author argues that he needed to talk to his kids without clearing it with the girlfriend first.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is whether talking to his son about the girlfriend was appropriate. The author had a valid reason: considering the kids' well-being and the comments from others that the girlfriend's behavior might affect the kids. The son's thoughts were important for the father to understand, especially since the kids are part of his life. He didn't do it to undermine the girlfriend, but to ensure the kids were okay.\n\nBut the girlfriend feels betrayed. However, as a parent, shouldn't he have the right to talk to his children about their living arrangements and people in their lives? The key point is that the conversation was about the son's feelings and not a criticism of the girlfriend. The author isn't in the wrong because the intention was to check in with his son, not to attack the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction seems over the top, especially since they are adults and the conversation was necessary for the children's sake. So, I think the answer is B.\n"
