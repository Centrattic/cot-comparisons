My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a father of two boys, living with his girlfriend. He's been supporting her after she lost her job. He asked her to pick up his kids from school a few days a week, which led to some conflict. Then he decided to talk to his older son about how the son feels about the living arrangement and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined, leading her to leave the house. The author is now wondering if he was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are about whether talking to the son about the girlfriend was appropriate. The father's intention was to check in with his son about how he's feeling, which is a common parental concern. He mentions that some Reddit commenters suggested the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of wanting to be there, prompting him to have this conversation. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is that she feels undermined and betrayed. She thinks the father lacks confidence in her. The father argues that he needed to be able to talk to his kids without prior approval from his girlfriend. \n\nFrom a parenting perspective, it's generally considered important for parents to communicate with their children about family dynamics to ensure the kids' emotional well-being. However, the way the conversation was approached might matter. If the father had a genuine concern about the children's feelings and addressed it directly with them, that's a responsible action. \n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt disrespected or that her role in the family was being questioned. The father didn't consult her before talking to the child, which could be seen as a breach of trust if they're in a committed relationship. However, the father is also an adult with the responsibility to his children's welfare. \n\nIn many cases, open communication between parents and children is encouraged, especially when it involves the child's feelings. The father's actions might be justified if he was concerned about the child's adjustment to the new living situation. However, if the conversation was framed in a way that criticized the girlfriend in front of the child or made the child choose between parents, that could be problematic. \n\nThe context provided doesn't mention any direct criticism of the girlfriend by the father during the conversation, just discussing the child's perceptions. The father's intent was to ensure his children's well-being, which is a valid reason. However, the girlfriend might perceive this as an overreach, especially if she felt her role as a caregiver was being questioned. \n\nSo, balancing the need to support the children and the importance of mutual respect in a relationship with a partner is tricky. The father might have handled it differently by maybe discussing his concerns with the girlfriend first, but since he didn't have prior issues as per the previous Reddit post, the conversation with the child was a way to check in. \n\nIn conclusion, the father's concern for his children's well-being is justified, and talking to them is a normal parental responsibility. However, the way it was done might have caused unnecessary tension with the girlfriend. But since the father's action was in the interest of his children and he's an adult with a duty to their welfare, it's more about the girlfriend's sensitivity than the father's wrongdoing. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
