My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author, a 44-year-old man, lives with his girlfriend and two sons, aged 8 and 14. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and the author has been supporting her financially. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which she didn't like and even called him an asshole. Then, after some Reddit comments made him realize that the kids might sense issues, he talked to his oldest son (14) about how he perceives the girlfriend and his mom being away. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, saying he undermined her and lacks confidence in her. She left to stay with a friend and wants to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe author's main argument is that he needed to talk to his son about his well-being, and he didn't mean to undermine the girlfriend. He feels he's an adult and should be able to discuss his children's feelings without permission. The question is whether he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, breaking it down. The key points are: communication with the child about a co-parenting situation, the girlfriend's reaction, and boundaries in relationships.\n\nFirst, talking to one's child about family dynamics seems reasonable, especially if the parent is concerned about the child's emotional state. The author mentions that he had a conversation with his oldest son to check in on how he's feeling about the situation. The son's valid thoughts and happiness are positive outcomes. However, the girlfriend took offense, feeling undermined. The author didn't intend to undermine her; he just wanted to ensure his son was okay.\n\nBut is there a line crossed here? In a relationship, especially when co-parenting, communication is key, but so is respecting each other's roles. The author didn't inform the girlfriend about the conversation, which might have caused her to feel disrespected or not trusted. The girlfriend's reaction could stem from insecurity or a desire to maintain her role as a stepmother. However, the author's responsibility to his children's well-being is significant. \n\nIn most cases, parents should be able to talk to their children without needing permission from their partner, especially regarding the child's well-being. However, the context of the conversation might matter. If the author criticized the girlfriend during the talk, that could be different. But he says the conversation was about both his ex-wife's absence and the girlfriend. The girlfriend might have felt that he was discussing her behind her back, which can be a trust issue.\n\nBut the author's intention was to check in with his son, not to undermine her. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but the author didn't seek to hurt her feelings. There's a balance between a parent's duty to their child and respecting their partner's feelings. It's possible that the author didn't consider how the conversation might affect his girlfriend, which could have been a mistake. However, the core issue is the child's well-being, which is a parent's primary responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's approach might have been a communication misstep, his intention was to ensure his son's happiness. The girlfriend's overreaction might be the bigger issue here. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for better communication practices.\n"
