My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a father, talks to his son about how the son perceives the author's girlfriend. The girlfriend finds out and gets really upset, thinking he undermined her. The author's reasoning is that he wanted to check in with his son about how he feels about the new living situation and the girlfriend. He mentions that people commented in his previous post that the kids might sense the girlfriend not wanting to be there, so he wanted to address that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's intent. He says he had a valid reason\u2014to ensure his son's well-being and to confirm that the changes weren't hurting him. As a parent, it's natural to want to talk to your kids about their feelings, especially when there's a significant change in their environment, like a new caregiver or family member. The father's action seems to come from a place of responsibility towards his children.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She feels that he lacks confidence in her and that he's betraying her by talking to the son about her. The key point here is whether the father should have discussed the girlfriend with the son. But the father clarifies that the conversation was not just about the girlfriend; it was also about the son's mother being away. So he wasn't solely focusing on the girlfriend's role, which might mitigate the girlfriend's feelings of being targeted.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics between the father and his girlfriend: they live together, and she's in a transitional phase (unemployed), which might add stress. The father is supporting her, but now this conversation caused a rift. The father argues that he's an adult and needs to be able to talk to his kids without needing permission. That makes sense because parents should have autonomy in discussing their children's feelings with them.\n\nHowever, one might argue that the father should have considered the girlfriend's feelings and perhaps discussed the conversation with her first. But the father's intention was to check in with his son, not to undermine the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling disrespected, but since the father's primary concern was his son's well-being, it's a bit of a conflict between parental responsibility and the girlfriend's need for validation.\n\nI think the father is not in the wrong because his actions were in the best interest of his child. Parents need the freedom to discuss their children's feelings with them without interference from the other parent or partner. The girlfriend's overreaction might be due to insecurity or the stress of her own situation, but that doesn't make the father's action wrong. He didn't have malicious intent to hurt her; he was focused on his son. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
