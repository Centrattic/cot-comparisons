My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a dad with two kids, living with his girlfriend. His girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which caused some conflict. Then, after getting advice from Reddit that the kids might be picking up on the girlfriend's negative behavior, he talked to his son about how he feels about the situation, including his mom and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, saying he undermined her.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, the key points here are:\n\n1. The author wanted to check in with his son about his feelings regarding the household dynamics. This seems like a responsible action as a parent to ensure the kids are okay.\n2. The girlfriend felt undermined and that the author doesn't trust her. She left the house, indicating significant distress.\n3. The author argues that he needed to talk to his kids without needing permission from his girlfriend, which is a valid point since the kids are his responsibility.\n\nBut, the way he approached the conversation might have been problematic. If he brought up the girlfriend in a way that criticized her, even indirectly, that could be seen as undermining her. However, the author says the conversation was about both his ex-wife and the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, which might be due to feeling disrespected or not trusted.\n\nIn terms of parental rights, parents do have the right to talk to their children about family matters. However, it's important to consider how it's communicated. If the father approached the conversation with an agenda to find faults in the girlfriend, that's different. But the author's intent seems to be checking in on the kids' well-being.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be over-the-top, but that doesn't mean the author had no role. Maybe he didn't consider how the conversation would be perceived by the girlfriend. There's a balance between a parent's duty to their children and respecting a partner's feelings. If the father had a more neutral, non-judgmental approach, maybe the girlfriend wouldn't feel attacked.\n\nIn similar situations, it's often advised to communicate openly with the partner first. The author didn't consult his girlfriend before talking to the son, which could be a misstep. Even if he had good intentions, the method might have been flawed. So, while the author's intent was to check on his kids, the approach might have lacked consideration for the girlfriend's feelings, making him at least partially at fault.\n\nSo, the answer could be A (yes, in the wrong) because he didn't communicate with his partner before discussing her with the child, potentially causing unnecessary conflict. But there's also the aspect of a parent's right to talk to their kids. However, given the girlfriend's reaction and the potential for the conversation to be perceived as undermining, the answer leans towards A.\n"
