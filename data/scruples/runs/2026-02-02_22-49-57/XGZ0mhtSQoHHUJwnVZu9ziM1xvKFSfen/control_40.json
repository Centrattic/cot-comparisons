My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got really upset, thinking he undermined her. The author's main argument is that he needs to be able to talk to his kids without needing permission from his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of co-parenting. The author is a parent with two kids, and his girlfriend is living with him. He's responsible for making sure his children are well-adjusted. If he's concerned about how the kids feel about the new living situation and the girlfriend, it's reasonable for him to check in with them. That seems like a normal parental duty. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. She left the house, called him an asshole, and accused him of betraying her. But the author's intention was to ensure the kids are okay, not to criticize the girlfriend. The conversation was about both the son's mother (who is absent) and the girlfriend. So, the author didn't go out of his way to attack her; it was a necessary conversation for the kids' well-being.\n\nHowever, maybe the author didn't consider how the girlfriend would feel. If the kids are aware of the previous conflict (from the original post), talking to them might inadvertently affect the girlfriend's position. But is that the author's fault? Parents have the right to discuss their children's feelings with them. The girlfriend might be sensitive because she's already in a vulnerable position (just lost a job, taking on childcare duties), but that doesn't give her the right to overreact to a normal parent-child conversation.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have discussed this with the girlfriend first. But the post says he didn't think of it until someone mentioned the kids might sense the tension. He had a valid reason to talk to his son. The girlfriend's reaction seems more about feeling insecure or undermined, but the author's action was in the best interest of the children.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author's action seems justified. The girlfriend's overreaction is her own issue, not his wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
