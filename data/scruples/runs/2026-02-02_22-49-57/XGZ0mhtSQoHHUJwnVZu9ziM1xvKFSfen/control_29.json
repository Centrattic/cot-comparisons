My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The author is a father who lives with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, which led to conflict. Then, the author had a conversation with his older son about his feelings towards the living arrangement and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got upset, thinking the author undermined her.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the dynamics here. The author's intention was to check in with his son about how he feels, which is a responsible action as a parent. The son's well-being is important, so talking to him is reasonable. However, the girlfriend felt undermined and that her position was questioned. The key is whether the author's actions were respectful and appropriate.\n\nThe author didn't consult his girlfriend before talking to the son. While parents should talk to their children about family matters, including step-parents, how it's done matters. The girlfriend might feel that the conversation was one-sided and could affect the son's perception of her. However, the author's primary responsibility is to his children's emotional state. \n\nOn one hand, the author isn't wrong for caring about his son's feelings. On the other hand, maybe a better approach would have been discussing it with the girlfriend first, but the situation doesn't mention prior communication attempts. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but the author's intent was not to undermine her. \n\nSo, considering the author's intent was to ensure his son is okay, which is a parent's duty, and the girlfriend's reaction is more about feeling disrespected, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
