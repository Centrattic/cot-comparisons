My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a father who talked to his son about his girlfriend) is in the wrong. The situation involves the father having a conversation with his 14-year-old son about how the son perceives the girlfriend, which led to the girlfriend being upset and leaving.\n\nFirst, the father's intention was to check in with his son about his feelings regarding the new living arrangements and the girlfriend. He did this because previous comments on his Reddit post suggested that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm. The father wanted to ensure he wasn't harming his kids, which is a reasonable concern. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend felt that discussing her with the son without her knowledge was a breach of trust. She took it as an attack on her and left the house. The key issue here is communication. The father didn't inform the girlfriend beforehand, which might have caused her to feel undermined. \n\nIn co-parenting situations, especially with a new partner, communication between the adults is crucial. While the father's intention was to protect his child's well-being, he might have failed to consider the girlfriend's perspective. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but it's possible she felt her boundaries were crossed. \n\nBut then again, the father has a right to discuss his children's feelings with them. The son is old enough to have such a conversation, and the father's approach seems non-confrontational. The girlfriend's reaction might be over the top, but the father could have handled it better by discussing with the girlfriend first. \n\nSo, is the father in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He had good intentions but didn't communicate with his girlfriend. However, he had a valid reason to talk to his son. The answer might hinge on whether discussing the girlfriend's role in front of the child was necessary. Some might say the father overstepped, others might say it was a responsible act. \n\nConsidering all factors, the father's action, while well-intentioned, could be seen as a misstep in how he handled the communication. But it's not necessarily a clear case of being in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is also extreme. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there are elements where he could have done better.\n"
