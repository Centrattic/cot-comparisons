My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The key points are:\n\n1. The father had a conversation with his son about his girlfriend to check in on his feelings, which he hadn't done before. The son was happy with the arrangement.\n2. The girlfriend found out and felt undermined, leading her to storm out and reconsider the relationship.\n3. The father argues that he needed to talk to his kids without clearing it with his girlfriend, as they are adults.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the father overstepped. Parents have a responsibility to their children's well-being, including understanding their emotional state. Talking to his son about the girlfriend seems like a reasonable step to ensure the son is okay, especially given the context of the previous issues mentioned (like the girlfriend calling him an asshole before).\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is strong. She felt her position was undermined. The question is whether the father should have discussed his girlfriend's role with the son without her knowledge. But from a parent's perspective, discussing a child's feelings about their living situation and family members is part of parenting. The father didn't go to the son to criticize the girlfriend; he was assessing the child's well-being. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction could stem from feeling disrespected or not trusted. However, the father is the parent, and he should have the right to communicate with his children about their family dynamics. The fact that she left and accused him of being a child suggests her issue is more about her own insecurities or the way the conversation was handled rather than the act itself.\n\nIn terms of parenting, transparency and open communication with children are important. The father's intention was to ensure his son's well-being, which is a valid concern. Unless there was prior agreement to discuss such matters with the girlfriend first, which isn't mentioned, he's within his rights as a parent. \n\nTherefore, the father isn't in the wrong. He acted in the best interest of his child, and the girlfriend's reaction might be more about her own feelings about being questioned rather than the father's wrongdoing. The answer should be B (No).\n"
