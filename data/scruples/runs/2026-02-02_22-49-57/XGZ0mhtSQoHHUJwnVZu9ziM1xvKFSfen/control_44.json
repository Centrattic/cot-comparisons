My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who talked to his son about his perception of his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, feeling undermined, and left the house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author has two children, 8 and 14 years old. He's living with his girlfriend, who recently lost her job, and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to a previous conflict. Now, he's sitting down with his oldest son (14) to talk about how the son feels about the living arrangements and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling that he undermined her and lacks confidence in her. The author argues that he was checking on his son's well-being and that the conversation was about both the previous mother's absence and the current girlfriend.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether talking to his son about his girlfriend is wrong. The author's intention is to ensure his son is okay, which is a parent's responsibility. However, the girlfriend felt betrayed. The key here is communication and boundaries. As a parent, he has a right to talk to his children about their well-being, especially regarding their living situation and relationships. However, maybe he should have considered how the girlfriend would feel and perhaps discussed it with her first, depending on the context of their relationship. \n\nBut the question is if he's in the wrong. If the conversation was about the child's feelings and not a criticism of the girlfriend, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but relationships require communication. The problem might be that he didn't inform her about the conversation. But is that an issue? The parent's primary responsibility is to the child. So, unless the conversation was meant to undermine the girlfriend, which the author says it wasn't, he might not be in the wrong. However, maybe he should have been more considerate of the girlfriend's feelings. \n\nIn some cases, involving a partner in discussions about their relationship with your children can be sensitive. But the author's main goal was the child's welfare. The girlfriend's reaction could be a red flag. But the author is an adult, and talking to his son is his right. The girlfriend's maturity in handling the situation is questionable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's a parent doing his duty, and the girlfriend's overreaction is the issue here. However, he might need to improve communication with his girlfriend. But in terms of right and wrong, he's not the asshole.\n"
