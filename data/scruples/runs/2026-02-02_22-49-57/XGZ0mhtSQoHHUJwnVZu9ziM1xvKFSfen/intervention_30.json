My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The author has two kids with an ex (their mom is away), lives with his girlfriend, and the girlfriend recently lost her job. The author had her watch the kids part-time, which led to conflict. Then, the author decided to talk to his oldest son (14) about how he feels regarding the mother being away and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and was upset, feeling undermined.\n\nThe author's intention was to check in on the kids' well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. The main question is whether discussing the girlfriend with the son was appropriate. \n\nParenting typically involves having open conversations with children about their lives and family dynamics. However, if the conversation is perceived as critical of the girlfriend, it could cause tension. The author mentions the conversation was also about the mother's trip, so it's part of a broader discussion about the family situation. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014calling it betrayal and a maturity issue. But the author is an adult and has the right to speak with his children about their family without needing permission. While the way the conversation was handled might have been a misstep (maybe not being clear enough about the intent), the act itself isn't inherently wrong. \n\nThe key points are the parent's duty to understand the kids' feelings and the girlfriend's overreaction. The author didn't intend to undermine; he was concerned about the kids' well-being. So, it's more about the girlfriend's insecurity than the author being in the wrong.\n"
