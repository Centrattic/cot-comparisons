My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author is a guy living with his girlfriend and two sons. His girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She got upset and called him an asshole. Then, after some feedback, he talked to his oldest son (14) about how the son perceives his mother (the ex?), the situation with the girlfriend, etc. The girlfriend found out and got really angry, saying he undermined her and didn't have confidence in her. She left the house and said she needs to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe author argues that he needed to talk to his kids about these things without his girlfriend's approval. He's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. From the parent's perspective, talking to your child about family dynamics is probably necessary. Kids do pick up on things, and it's important to address their feelings. The problem arises when the partner feels disrespected or undermined. The author didn't talk to the son to criticize the girlfriend but to understand the kids' perspectives. However, the girlfriend saw it as a betrayal. \n\nBut parents should have the right to discuss their children's well-being with them. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. If she's supposed to be part of the family, the kids might need to talk about her role. The author didn't consult her before talking to the child, which might be an oversight, but it's not necessarily wrong. The key is intent. The author's intent was to check in with the child, not to undermine the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about her own insecurities or misinterpretation. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He did what a responsible parent would do. The girlfriend overreacted. Therefore, answer B.\n"
