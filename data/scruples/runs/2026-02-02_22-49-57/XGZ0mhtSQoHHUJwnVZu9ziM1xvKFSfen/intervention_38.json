My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author, a 44-year-old dad, has two kids and a girlfriend. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few times a week. She got upset and called him an asshole. Now, he's talked to his son about how he perceives the girlfriend and the situation. The girlfriend found out and is really upset, thinking he undermined her. The author is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to check in with his son about how he feels about the new living arrangements and the girlfriend. As a parent, it's reasonable to want to know how his children are adjusting. The son was happy, so that's a good sign. But the girlfriend felt betrayed because he discussed her without her knowledge. \n\nThe key here is whether talking to his son about his perceptions of the girlfriend is wrong. Parents often have conversations with their kids about family dynamics. However, if the conversation was specifically critical of the girlfriend, that's different. The author says the conversation was about both his ex-wife being away and the girlfriend. He didn't go to undermine her. \n\nBut maybe the girlfriend felt that discussing her with the child without her input made her feel untrusted. In relationships, partners might expect a level of consultation. However, the author is the parent, and it's part of his parenting role to discuss family matters with his kids. \n\nIs there a breach of trust? If the author had talked to the kids in a way that criticized the girlfriend or made the kids choose sides, that's one thing. But if it's just about understanding the kids' feelings, it's within his parental responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme if the conversation was neutral and aimed at the kids' well-being.\n\nStill, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author could have approached it differently. Perhaps he should have considered how she might react, but he didn't have to consult her before talking to his own children. The main issue is that the author did what any parent would do\u2014check in with their kids. The girlfriend's overreaction might be her own insecurity or jealousy. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's fulfilling his role as a parent. The answer is B.\n"
