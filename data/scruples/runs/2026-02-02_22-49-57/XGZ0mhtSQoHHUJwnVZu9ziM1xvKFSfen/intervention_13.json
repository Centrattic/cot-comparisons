My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The man lives with his girlfriend and his two kids. The girlfriend recently lost her job and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She got upset and called him an asshole. Now, he's tried to talk to his 14-year-old son to understand how he feels about the situation, including his mom being away and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, feeling undermined and questioning the relationship. The author is wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nThe key points here are the parent's responsibility to understand their child's feelings and the boundaries in a relationship. Parents often need to have open conversations with their kids about various aspects of their lives, including new partners. However, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the child without her knowledge crosses a boundary. But considering the child's well-being and the parent's duty to ensure the child's adjustment, the conversation seems necessary. The author didn't intend to undermine the girlfriend; he wanted to check on his son's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but the author isn't wrong for wanting to talk to his own child. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
