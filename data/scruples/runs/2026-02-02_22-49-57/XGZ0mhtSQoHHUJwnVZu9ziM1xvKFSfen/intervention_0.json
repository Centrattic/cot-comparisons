My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The original situation involves the author living with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She was upset about that, called him an asshole. Then he decided to talk to his oldest son (14 years old) about how he feels regarding his mother being away and his girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and was extremely upset, feeling undermined and that he lacks confidence in her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did something wrong. The key points here are communication with his son and the girlfriend's reaction. The author's intention was to check in with his son about his well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. However, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the child without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust. But the author argues that he needed to talk to his son about the family dynamics and that he's an adult who can have those conversations.\n\nIs it right for a parent to talk to their child about their parent's partner or step-parent? Generally, yes, especially if the child is old enough to understand. The son is 14, so a teenager, capable of having such discussions. The author didn't share the conversation with others but kept it between him and his son. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but maybe she's feeling insecure or not consulted, which is a separate issue. The problem is whether the author overstepped by discussing his girlfriend with the son without her knowledge. However, since it's about the son's perception and the author's own family dynamics, it's a reasonable action. The girlfriend's need to \"rethink the relationship\" is her response, but the author isn't in the wrong for fulfilling his role as a parent. So, answer B.\n"
