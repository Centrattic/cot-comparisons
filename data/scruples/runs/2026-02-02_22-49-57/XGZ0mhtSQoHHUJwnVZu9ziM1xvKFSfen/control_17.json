My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how he perceives the author's girlfriend. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a father of two boys, 8 and 14. He lives with his girlfriend and his kids. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he started supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to her calling him an asshole. In the comments on his previous Reddit post, people mentioned that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of willingness to be around them. He hadn't considered this before but then decided to talk to his oldest son (14) about how he feels regarding the living situation and his mom (the ex) and the girlfriend.\n\nAfter the conversation, the girlfriend found out and got really upset, thinking he undermined her and didn't trust her. She left the house to stay with a friend and said she needed to rethink the relationship. The author feels he's not in the wrong because he needed to talk to his kids about their well-being, and the conversation was also about their mother's absence.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key points here are: parents should be able to talk to their kids about family matters, including their other parent (the girlfriend). However, the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling undermined. The author didn't go to the kid to criticize the girlfriend, but to discuss the kid's perception of both parents and the situation. \n\nFrom a child's perspective, it's reasonable for a parent to check in on how they're adjusting to the new living arrangements. The author mentions the conversation was balanced between talking about the ex and the girlfriend. However, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in front of the child without her knowledge could affect their dynamic or the child's perception of her. \n\nBut on the other hand, the father has a responsibility to understand his children's feelings and ensure they're not negatively impacted by the family situation. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but maybe there's some valid concern about being discussed behind her back. However, the father's intention was to understand his son's feelings, which is a parent's right. The girlfriend might have felt it was a breach of trust, but the author didn't ask the kid to criticize her. \n\nI think the main issue here is communication. The father didn't clear it with the girlfriend before talking to the son, which could be seen as a lack of consideration. But since the father is the parent, he has the right to talk to his children about family matters. The girlfriend might be overreacting, but the father could have handled it better by discussing his intentions with her first. However, the core action\u2014talking to his son\u2014is not inherently wrong. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
