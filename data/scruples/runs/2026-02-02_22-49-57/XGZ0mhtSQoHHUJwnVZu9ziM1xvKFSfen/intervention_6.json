My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a parent who talks to their son about how the son perceives the author's girlfriend. The girlfriend then gets upset, feeling undermined and accuses the author of betraying her.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention was to check in with their child about how he's adjusting to his mother being away and living with the girlfriend. The parent mentions that they had valid reasons, considering previous advice that children might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm. The conversation was also about the mother's trip, not solely about the girlfriend. \n\nThe key point here is the parent's responsibility to their children's well-being. Parents naturally need to communicate with their kids about various aspects of their lives, including their relationships. However, the girlfriend feels that being discussed with the child without her consent is a breach of trust. \n\nBut the parent didn't go to the son to undermine the girlfriend. The parent's main concern was the child's feelings, which is a parent's duty. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling that her role in the household isn't respected. However, the parent isn't wrong for wanting to ensure their son is okay, especially if there were previous issues. \n\nIn such situations, communication between the parent and the girlfriend could have been important. The parent might have considered discussing their concerns with the girlfriend first, but the primary responsibility to the child's emotional state still stands. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme given the parent's intent wasn't to criticize her but to check on their child. \n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
