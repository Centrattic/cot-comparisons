My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The scenario is that the author has two sons, one of whom is 14 and the other 8. He talked to his oldest son (the 14-year-old) about how the son feels about his mother being away, living with him, and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got upset, thinking he undermined her, leading her to leave the house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents do need to communicate with their children to understand their feelings and ensure their well-being. The author mentions that people in the previous Reddit post suggested that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm, so he decided to check in with his son. That seems like a responsible action.\n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction is a problem. She felt betrayed and that her partner doesn't have confidence in her. The key point here is whether talking to the son about the girlfriend's role in their lives was appropriate. The author argues that he needed to talk to his children without needing permission from his girlfriend. The girlfriend, however, sees it as an attack on her.\n\nThe parent's intention was to check on the child's well-being, not to undermine the girlfriend. The conversation was also about the son's mother being away, which is part of the family dynamics. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt her position was being questioned, even if that wasn't the intent.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, parents generally have the right to discuss family matters with their children. The issue might be more about how the conversation was framed. If the parent approached the topic in a neutral way, focusing on the child's feelings rather than criticizing the girlfriend, it might have been better. But the core action\u2014talking to his son\u2014seems justified for a parent looking out for their child's emotional state.\n\nOn the other hand, if the parent's discussion made the son feel like the girlfriend wasn't a good influence, that could be an issue. But the parent says the son was happy with the situation overall, so maybe the conversation wasn't negative. The girlfriend's overreaction might stem from insecurity or the way the conversation was handled.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action seems reasonable as a parent's duty to know how their children feel about their living arrangements. The girlfriend's reaction is more about feeling disrespected, but the parent isn't wrong for wanting to ensure his son's well-being. So the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
