My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The author is a 44-year-old man living with his girlfriend and two sons. He asked his girlfriend to pick up their kids from school a few days a week after she lost her job, which led to her being upset. Now, the author had a conversation with his oldest son (14) about how the son perceives the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is angry, feeling undermined and that the author lacks confidence in her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights and responsibilities of both the author and the girlfriend. The author's intent was to communicate with his son, which is a natural part of parenting. He wanted to understand how his son felt about the situation with his mother (the ex) being away and his current living arrangements with the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling criticized or not trusted. \n\nFrom a parenting perspective, talking to children about their parents and guardians is important. The author might have thought it necessary to address any potential issues the son had, especially since previous comments suggested the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm. However, the girlfriend might have felt that the author was consulting the children without considering her feelings, as if he were taking sides or not respecting her role in the household.\n\nThe key points are: The author didn't discuss the girlfriend with the son to undermine her but to include the son's perspective on all family dynamics. The conversation was about the son's happiness and well-being. The girlfriend's overreaction could indicate insecurity or a need for communication about boundaries. \n\nBut, the author should have considered discussing the matter with the girlfriend first. Even though he had a right to talk to his son, doing so without her knowledge might have caused unnecessary tension. The girlfriend's role as a partner and co-parent in the household might require more mutual respect and prior consultation, especially on topics that involve her directly.\n\nHowever, the author is also a parent, and ensuring his children's well-being is paramount. If the son was happy, maybe the author's actions were justified. Yet, the way he approached it might have been insensitive. The girlfriend's feeling of betrayal suggests that the conversation's content or method was a problem. \n\nIn relationships, especially with children involved, communication is key. The author might not have been in the wrong, but his approach could have been better. However, the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme given the intent was to check on the child's well-being. \n\nI think the author isn't the asshole here because his intention was positive (parental concern) but maybe could have handled it more sensitively. However, the girlfriend's reaction is over the top. The correct answer is B (No), but I need to make sure there's no red flag I'm missing. The author didn't exclude the girlfriend from the conversation to criticize her but to include the child's voice. So the answer should be B.\n"
