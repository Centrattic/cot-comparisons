My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is a father with two kids, living with his girlfriend. The girlfriend recently lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to conflict. Now, he had a conversation with his son about how he feels about his mom being away, the living situation, and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author thinks he's not in the wrong because he needs to talk to his kids without clearing it with his girlfriend first.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether talking to his son about his girlfriend is wrong. The author's argument is that as a parent, he has the right to talk to his children about their lives and their mother's absence. He didn't mean to undermine his girlfriend; the conversation was also about his ex-wife's trip. The girlfriend felt betrayed and thinks he lacks confidence in her.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, a parent should be able to discuss family matters with their children without needing permission from a partner. It's part of parenting. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in front of the child is a breach of trust, especially if it's done without her knowledge. But the author didn't do it to undermine; he did it for the child's well-being. \n\nIn many cases, parents have to talk about partners or other family members to address the child's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but maybe she's feeling insecure or threatened by the conversation. However, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing his child's emotional health. The problem might be in how it was communicated or if there was prior tension. But the act itself of discussing the child's feelings seems reasonable. \n\nI think the key here is the intent. The author's intent was to check in with his son, not to criticize his girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction is about her feeling undermined, but the father's action was about the child's well-being. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
