My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset, feeling undermined. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has two kids with an ex-wife. He's living with his current girlfriend, who recently lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids sometimes, which led to conflict. Now, the author wanted to check in with his son about how he's dealing with the situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend took offense and left, feeling betrayed.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to talk to his son about his girlfriend. The author's reasoning is that as a parent, he needs to talk to his kids without needing permission. The girlfriend feels her authority is undermined.\n\nI think the key points here are: the right of a parent to communicate with their children about family matters versus a partner's feelings about being discussed. The author had valid concerns about his kids' well-being and wanted to ensure they weren't negatively affected by the girlfriend's possible resentment. The conversation wasn't malicious, but the girlfriend took offense. \n\nHowever, maybe the author should have considered how the girlfriend might feel. But on the other hand, parents should be able to discuss their children's lives without needing to consult their partner every time. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but the author's intention was to check in with his son, not to criticize the girlfriend. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's action was to protect his kids' interests. The girlfriend's reaction might be over the top, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was in the wrong. The core issue is whether the parent's duty to their children gives them the right to have these conversations, even if it upsets their partner. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because ensuring the children's well-being is a parent's responsibility, and the conversation was appropriate. The girlfriend's reaction is a problem, but the author isn't at fault here. Therefore, answer B.\n"
