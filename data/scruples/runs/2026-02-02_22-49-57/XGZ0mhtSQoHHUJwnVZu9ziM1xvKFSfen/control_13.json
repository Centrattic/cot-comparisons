My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a father living with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to conflict. Now, he sat down with his oldest son to discuss how the son feels about the current living situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. She left the house and wants to rethink the relationship.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether a parent is justified in talking to their child about the parent's partner. The author argues that he needed to ensure his children's well-being and that the conversation wasn't to undermine the girlfriend. The girlfriend feels her relationship with the author is being interfered with, and she's hurt.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, it's normal to be concerned about their children's feelings and adjust their approach if needed. The author had concerns after reading comments suggesting the children might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm. Talking to the son seems like a reasonable step to address those concerns. The conversation was also about the son's mother being away, not just the girlfriend. The author didn't go to the son to criticize the girlfriend but to understand the son's perspective.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is also significant. She might feel that the author didn't consult her first, which could be seen as a breach of trust. But, as an adult, the author has the right to discuss family matters with his children. The key here is that the author's intention was to check on his son's well-being, not to undermine the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, given that talking to one's child is a fundamental parental right.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have considered how the girlfriend would feel and discussed it with her first. However, the scenario doesn't indicate that the author had prior discussions with the girlfriend about the kids' feelings. The author might have acted without considering her feelings, but the action itself\u2014talking to the child about family dynamics\u2014doesn't seem wrong.\n\nIn terms of relationships, communication is key. The author might have handled the situation better by involving the girlfriend in the discussion about the children's feelings. However, the act of talking to the child isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about her insecurities or the way the conversation was approached rather than the conversation itself.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author's intention was parental concern, and the action is a normal part of parenting. The wrong here might lie more with the girlfriend's overreaction, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since talking to your child about their perceptions of a parent's partner is a standard parenting activity, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
