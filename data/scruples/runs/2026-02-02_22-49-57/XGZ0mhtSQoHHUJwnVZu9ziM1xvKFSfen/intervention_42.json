My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the Reddit post) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The key points here are the parent's intention and the girlfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the parent wanted to check in with his oldest son about how he's adjusting to his mother being away and living with the girlfriend. The parent mentions that the son was happy and hadn't been hurt, which suggests the conversation was constructive. The parent's main goal seems to be ensuring their kids are okay, which is a responsible thing for a parent to do.\n\nNow, the girlfriend is upset because she feels undermined. She thinks the parent is lacking confidence in her. But the parent argues that talking to the kids is part of their parental duty, not about the girlfriend. The parent didn't discuss the girlfriend's performance or criticize her directly; the conversation was about the kids' feelings overall.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, open communication is important. However, the parent's actions were about their children, not about the girlfriend. The parent didn't go out of their way to criticize or question the girlfriend's role in front of the child. The girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling that her autonomy in the relationship is being challenged, even though the parent's actions were within their rights as a parent.\n\nThe parent isn't in the wrong because they're fulfilling their responsibility to their children. The girlfriend's feelings, while valid, shouldn't override the parent's need to communicate with their kids. Unless there was prior agreement to not discuss partners in front of the kids, the parent's action is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
