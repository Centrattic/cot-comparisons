My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The author lives with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, which led to conflict. Now, after talking to his son and sharing that conversation with the girlfriend, she's upset and thinks he undermined her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points are the author's intention with talking to his son. He mentioned he did it to check in on the kids' well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. The conversation included topics about the girlfriend and his ex-wife. The girlfriend felt undermined and betrayed, leading to her leaving.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Parents often need to talk to their kids about various aspects of their lives, including relationships. However, the way the conversation was handled might be an issue. If the author focused on the girlfriend in a negative light or if the son felt the need to report it to the girlfriend, that could be problematic. However, the author states that the conversation was balanced and also included discussions about the mother. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but her feelings are valid if she felt disrespected or not trusted.\n\nIn such situations, communication between the author and his girlfriend is crucial. The author might have failed to consider how the conversation would be perceived, especially if it was done without the girlfriend's knowledge. However, parents have a right to discuss their children's well-being and relationships without necessarily involving their partner, especially if there are concerns about the partner's role.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the conversation was meant to assess the kids' feelings and he didn't badmouth the girlfriend, then he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction might be overblown, but the author should have considered discussing the approach with her first. However, as a parent, he has a duty to his children's emotional state. Therefore, the author's actions were justified, but perhaps his communication with his girlfriend could have been better. So the answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
