My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent talking to their son about how the son perceives the parent's girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset, feeling undermined, and the author is seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intent. The author mentions that they were concerned about their son's well-being and wanted to check in on how he's adjusting to his mom being away and living with the girlfriend. That seems like a responsible action as a parent. The parent's main goal was to understand their child's feelings, which is a valid reason to have such a conversation.\n\nNext, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She feels betrayed and undermined. But is her reaction justified? The parent didn't share the information with her first, but is that necessary? The children are the parent's responsibility, and discussing their feelings with them is part of being a parent. The parent isn't required to get permission to talk to their own children about family matters, especially when it's about the child's emotional state.\n\nThe comments from the previous post highlighted that the kids might notice the girlfriend's lack of engagement, so the parent acted on that advice. That shows the parent was trying to be proactive about their children's well-being, which is a positive step. The parent also clarified that the conversation wasn't just about the girlfriend but also about the mother's absence, which adds context to the discussion being balanced.\n\nThe girlfriend's claim that the parent has no confidence in her is a bit of a stretch. The conversation was about the child's perspective, not a direct criticism of the girlfriend. The parent's actions were about ensuring the child's emotional health, which is a parent's duty. The girlfriend's reaction seems more about feeling insecure or not trusted, but that doesn't make the parent wrong. \n\nIn terms of being an adult, both parties are expected to handle things maturely. The parent isn't at fault for talking to their child. The girlfriend's response might indicate issues in their relationship, but that doesn't mean the parent is the asshole here. The parent acted in the child's best interest, which should take precedence.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). The parent's actions were appropriate and necessary for the child's well-being, and the girlfriend's reaction, while strong, doesn't justify the parent being in the wrong.\n"
