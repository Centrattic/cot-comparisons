My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about his perception of the girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author has two sons, ages 8 and 14, and lives with his girlfriend. The older son, 14, was asked about how he feels about the girlfriend, his mother being away, etc. The author did this because people on Reddit mentioned that the kids might sense the girlfriend's reluctance to care for them. The son seemed okay, but the girlfriend got upset, felt undermined, and left.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The author's intention was to check in with his son about the family dynamics, not to criticize the girlfriend directly. The conversation was part of a broader discussion about his ex-wife and the new living situation. The girlfriend, however, took offense, feeling that her position as a step-parent was being questioned. \n\nIs it wrong for a parent to talk to their child about family matters? Generally, parents have a right to discuss their children's well-being and family dynamics with their kids. The child is part of the family, so discussing how he feels about the new living arrangements is reasonable. The author didn't go to the son to undermine the girlfriend; the son brought up the girlfriend's role in his answers. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems over the top. If she felt that the conversation was about evaluating her parenting, that's a valid concern, but the author's intent was to ensure the child's well-being. However, it's possible that the author didn't consider how his actions might make the girlfriend feel. Maybe he should have included her in the conversation or discussed it with her beforehand, but is that necessary? The author is the parent; he has a duty to his children's emotional state. \n\nThe girlfriend's response\u2014storming out and threatening to rethink the relationship\u2014might be an overreaction. But the author's action might have been a breach in their relationship's unspoken rules. Did he overstep by discussing the girlfriend in front of the child without her consent? If the conversation was about the child's feelings, then it's part of parenting. But if it included specific criticisms or evaluations of the girlfriend, maybe that's where it went wrong. The author says the conversation was as much about the mother's trip as the girlfriend, so maybe he didn't focus on the girlfriend. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, parents need to communicate with their children about family issues. The girlfriend might need to understand that part of being a step-parent involves the parent discussing the child's feelings with them. However, the author could have handled it more sensitively. Maybe a follow-up conversation with the girlfriend about the discussion would have been better. But the initial conversation with the child isn't inherently wrong. \n\nSo, the answer likely leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because the parent's duty to the child's emotional health is primary. However, the execution could have been better. Still, the act of discussing the child's feelings isn't wrong per se. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her insecurities or boundaries not being respected, but the author isn't necessarily at fault here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
