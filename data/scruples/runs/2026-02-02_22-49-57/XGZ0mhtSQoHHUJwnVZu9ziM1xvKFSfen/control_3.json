My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by talking to his son about his girlfriend. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a father living with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She reacted negatively, calling him an asshole. Now, the author decided to talk to his oldest son (14) about how he feels about the situation, including his perception of the girlfriend and his mother. The girlfriend found out and got extremely upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. She left the house. The author is now asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the father wanted to understand his son's feelings about the new living arrangement and the girlfriend. He had a conversation that included his son's thoughts on the girlfriend and his mother's absence. The girlfriend felt that this conversation was an attack on her and that her partner didn't trust her. The author argues that he's an adult and should be able to talk to his kids without needing permission from his girlfriend.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Parents have a responsibility to check in with their children's well-being, especially when there are changes in family structure. The author had a valid concern after seeing comments on his previous post about children sensing negative behavior. He wanted to make sure his son wasn't being affected negatively. That seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, the way he approached the conversation might have been problematic. If the conversation focused a lot on the girlfriend's behavior or if he shared that information with others without her knowledge, that could cause issues. But according to the author, the conversation was also about the mother's trip and he didn't go to undermine the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, which suggests she might feel insecure or not trusted.\n\nOn one hand, parents should be able to talk to their kids about family matters. On the other hand, sharing those conversations with a partner or discussing a partner in a way that could be seen as critical might cross a line. The key is whether the father's intent was to undermine the girlfriend. The author claims it wasn't, but the girlfriend perceived it that way.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. If the author had discussed his intention with the girlfriend beforehand, maybe that would have avoided the conflict. But he's not necessarily wrong for wanting to talk to his son. The girlfriend's reaction seems over the top, but her feeling of betrayal might stem from a lack of trust in their relationship.\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? If the author had a legitimate reason to talk to his son about the family dynamics and his son's well-being, then he's not wrong. However, if the conversation was framed in a way that criticized the girlfriend or if he shared the results with others without her consent, that could be an issue. But based on his description, the conversation was about the child's perceptions, which is part of being a responsible parent.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but that doesn't automatically make the author right. However, since the author's intent was to understand his son's feelings and not to undermine the girlfriend, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. The main issue might be the lack of communication between the author and his girlfriend about why he wanted to talk to the son. But the act of talking to his son itself is a reasonable parental action.\n"
