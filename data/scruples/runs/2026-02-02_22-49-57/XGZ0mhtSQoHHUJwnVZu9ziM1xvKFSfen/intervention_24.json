My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The situation involves a father talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The father had a previous issue where his girlfriend was upset when he asked her to pick up the kids. Then he talked to his son to check in on his feelings, and the girlfriend reacted strongly, thinking he undermined her. The author is asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. As a parent, he's responsible for his children's well-being, so having an open conversation with his son about the family dynamics seems reasonable. He did this to ensure his son feels supported and to address any potential issues. It's important for parents to communicate with their kids, especially when there are changes in the family structure, like a new partner.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels betrayed. She might perceive the conversation as a lack of trust. However, the father wasn't criticizing her directly but rather checking in with his son. Maybe the girlfriend felt threatened or not respected. But is it the father's fault if he's just fulfilling his role as a parent? He didn't need to discuss the girlfriend in a negative way; the conversation was about the son's feelings and the mother being away. \n\nThe key point is whether the father overstepped. Since he's the parent, he's entitled to talk to his children about their experiences. The girlfriend might need to realize that the father's priority is his children's well-being. However, the father should also consider his partner's feelings. Maybe there's a better way to approach such conversations without making the partner feel undermined. But in this case, the father's intention was to understand his son's perspective, not to criticize the girlfriend. \n\nSo, the father isn't in the wrong because he's acting in his children's best interest. The girlfriend's reaction seems excessive, as the father has a right to communicate with his children. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
