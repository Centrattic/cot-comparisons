My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the Reddit post) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The man lives with his girlfriend and his two sons. His girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week. She was upset about that. Then, he talked to his oldest son about his feelings regarding the girlfriend and his mother. The girlfriend found out and is now upset, feeling undermined and that he doesn't trust her. The man is confused because he thinks he's just being a parent and needs to talk to his kids without his girlfriend's permission.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the father's responsibility to check in with his child, the girlfriend's reaction, and the dynamics of their relationship. \n\nFrom a parental perspective, talking to your child about their feelings and their perception of people around them is generally considered a good thing. Parents should be aware of how their children feel about all the adults in their lives, especially since the children's well-being is the priority. The man is trying to ensure that his son is okay with the living situation and the presence of his girlfriend. That seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is significant. She feels that the conversation undermined her. It's possible that she felt the conversation was a critique of her role in the household or that she was being evaluated by the child. The man might not have considered her perspective when initiating the talk. But since the conversation was with his child, it's a parental duty to address the child's feelings, not a betrayal of the girlfriend. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, the girlfriend's response seems extreme. If she's concerned about being judged, that's an issue between her and the man. However, the man isn't wrong for prioritizing his child's emotional state. He didn't have to consult her before talking to his son, as the child is his responsibility. \n\nThere's no indication that the conversation was malicious. The man's intention was to understand his son's feelings, not to criticize his girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from her own insecurities or the stress of losing her job. But the man isn't the one at fault here for doing what's best for his child.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the man is not in the wrong. He's acting in his child's best interest, which is a parent's duty. The girlfriend's reaction is a relationship issue, but it doesn't make the man the asshole for talking to his son. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
