My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author in the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who's a dad, talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got really upset and accused him of undermining her. The author's main point is that he needed to talk to his kids about their well-being, especially since the son's mother is away (maybe because she lost her job), and the girlfriend was supposed to be watching them but there was some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's intention was to check in with his son to see if he was okay with the living situation and how he felt about the girlfriend. He did this because people on Reddit had warned him that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm. The girlfriend, however, took offense and felt undermined. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Parents have a responsibility to their children's well-being. Talking to your kids about their feelings towards people in their lives, especially when there are new family members, is generally seen as a responsible act. The author didn't go to the kids to criticize the girlfriend but to understand their perspective. \n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction is also a factor. She might feel that her authority or position in the family is being questioned. However, the father should have the right to discuss his children's feelings with them without needing permission. The girlfriend's response seems a bit overblown. \n\nIs there a breach of trust or boundaries? The father didn't speak ill of the girlfriend; he just wanted the son's input. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or a lack of communication. The father's actions seem justified as a parent's duty. \n\nBut maybe there's a way to approach it that's more considerate. Perhaps discussing it with the girlfriend first could have been better, but the father had a valid reason to talk to the son directly, especially if he was concerned about the kids' adjustment. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the father's actions don't seem malicious. He was acting in his children's best interest. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but the father isn't the one at fault here. The answer would likely be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
