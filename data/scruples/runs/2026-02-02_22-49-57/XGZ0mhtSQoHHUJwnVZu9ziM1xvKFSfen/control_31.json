My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation is that the author has two sons, lives with his girlfriend, and after a previous situation where his girlfriend was upset about being asked to pick up the kids, he checks in with his oldest son to see how he feels about the current living arrangements and his girlfriend. The girlfriend then gets upset, feeling undermined and betrayed, and leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The father wanted to talk to his son about how the son feels about the new living situation, especially after previous concerns were raised about the kids sensing tension. The father's intention was to ensure the kids are okay and not being hurt, which seems like a responsible parent's action. However, the girlfriend felt that the conversation was an attack on her and that her feelings were disregarded.\n\nThe question is whether the father overstepped. The father isn't the one who initially caused the problem; the previous issue was about the girlfriend's actions (calling him an asshole over picking up the kids). Now, he's trying to address the kids' well-being. Parents do need to communicate with their children about family dynamics, especially when a new partner is involved. However, maybe the father should have considered discussing this with his girlfriend first, even if it's a parent's right to talk to their kids. But the father's main concern was the kids' feelings, not undermining the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but maybe there's some validity in her feeling that her position in the family is being questioned.\n\nBut the father is an adult and a parent; he has a duty to his children's well-being. The fact that the conversation was about the kids' feelings and the girlfriend's role in their lives might be necessary. The father isn't in the wrong for checking in with his son. The girlfriend's reaction might be overreacting, but the father's action was reasonable as a parent. So the answer would be B, the father is not in the wrong.\n"
