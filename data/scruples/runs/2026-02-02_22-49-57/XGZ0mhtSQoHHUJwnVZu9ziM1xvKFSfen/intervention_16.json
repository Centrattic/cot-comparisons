My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to their son about how he perceives the girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has two sons, ages 8 and 14. They live with their girlfriend, who recently lost her job and is being supported by the author. The author previously asked the girlfriend to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to a conflict. Now, the author had a conversation with their oldest son (14) about how the son views the girlfriend and the situation with the ex-wife. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. She left the house, saying she needs to reevaluate the relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they needed to check in with their children's well-being, especially after feedback from others that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of commitment. They didn't clear the conversation with the girlfriend first, which is why she's upset. The author feels they're justified because they needed to talk to their kids without needing permission.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: parents have a duty to ensure their children's emotional health. Discussing how the children feel about caregivers is part of that responsibility. However, the girlfriend might feel that the conversation was a criticism of her, especially if the son's perception was negative. The key points here are intent and context. The author's intent was to assess the kids' feelings, not to undermine the girlfriend. But the way it was done might have made the girlfriend feel untrusted or criticized.\n\nBut in such situations, it's common for parents to speak to their children about family members to understand their adjustment. However, if the approach made the girlfriend feel attacked, maybe the author should have been more cautious. However, given that the conversation was about the kids' well-being and not a direct criticism, the author might not be in the wrong. It's more about communication style and sensitivity. But since the author's primary responsibility is to their children, they aren't necessarily wrong for checking in. So the answer is B.\n"
