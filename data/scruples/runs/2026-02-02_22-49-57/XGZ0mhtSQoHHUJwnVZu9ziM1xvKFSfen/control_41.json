My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a dad talking to his son about how the son feels about the dad's girlfriend and his mom. The girlfriend got really upset and left, saying he undermined her. The author thinks he's not the asshole because he needed to talk to his kids without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what actions were taken. The dad had a conversation with his son about his relationship with his girlfriend and his mom. The son was happy, but the girlfriend felt undermined. The key points here are communication with children and the girlfriend's reaction.\n\nAs a parent, talking to your kids about family dynamics is usually important for their well-being. The dad wanted to check in on his kids' feelings, which is a responsible action. However, the method might matter. Did he share the conversation details with the girlfriend? Did he involve her in the process? The girlfriend might feel that her authority or role as a parent figure is being questioned without her input.\n\nThe girlfriend left because she felt betrayed. That's a strong reaction. The dad didn't consult her before talking to the kids, which could lead to hurt feelings. But is that his fault? Parents typically have the right to discuss family matters with their children. However, if the boyfriend/girlfriend has a co-parenting role, maybe the dad should have included her in the conversation.\n\nBut the dad wasn't trying to undermine the girlfriend; he was focusing on the kids' well-being. The girlfriend's reaction might be over the top. The dad is an adult, and discussing his children's feelings is part of parenting. However, maybe the way he approached it could have been more considerate, like discussing it with the girlfriend first. But in some cases, especially if the girlfriend is not the legal parent, the dad might not need her permission to talk to his kids.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the dad acted out of concern for his children's well-being, which is a valid reason. The girlfriend's reaction is intense but might stem from insecurity or feeling excluded. However, the dad isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his kids' needs. He didn't have to clear the conversation with her first. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
