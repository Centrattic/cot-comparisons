My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The author's girlfriend is upset because she feels undermined. \n\nFirst, parents usually have the right to talk to their kids about various aspects of their lives, including family members. The author's intention was to check in on his son's well-being, not to criticize his girlfriend. The conversation was about the son's feelings towards both his mother's absence and the girlfriend. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014she feels betrayed and that the author lacks confidence in her. It's possible the author didn't consider how the girlfriend would interpret the conversation. Even if the intent was good, the manner in which it was done might have caused hurt feelings.\n\nBut then again, the author is an adult with two children. He has a responsibility to ensure their emotional well-being. The girlfriend's reaction might be over the top, especially since she's already stressed about losing her job. The key here is whether the author overstepped by discussing the girlfriend with the son without her knowledge. \n\nIn many cases, being honest with your kids about their relationships with other family members is necessary. However, maybe the author should have mentioned his plans to talk to the son with his girlfriend beforehand, even if it's not strictly necessary. Still, the main issue is the son's well-being, not the girlfriend's feelings. \n\nSo, the answer might be B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. He acted in the children's best interest. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, and the author has a right to communicate with his children without needing permission from his partner. The main problem isn't the conversation itself but the girlfriend's insecurity or misinterpretation.\n"
