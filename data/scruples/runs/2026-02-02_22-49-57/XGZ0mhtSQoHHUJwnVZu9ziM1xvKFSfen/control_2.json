My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to determine if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a father in his 40s living with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week. She took offense and called him an asshole. Now, the author had a conversation with his oldest son (14 years old) about how the son perceives his mother, the girlfriend, and the situation. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. She left the house and wants to reevaluate the relationship. The author argues that he needed to talk to his son about these matters without clearing it with his girlfriend first, as part of his parental responsibility.\n\nSo the main question is: Is the author in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son views the girlfriend?\n\nFirst, I should consider the parents' roles here. The author is the father, and it's natural for him to want to check in with his children about their well-being, especially considering the recent changes in their family dynamics (mom being away, a new stepmom, etc.). Parents often talk to their kids about various aspects of their lives, including relationships with others in the household. It's part of understanding their children's feelings and ensuring they're okay. The author mentions that the conversation was about both the mother (the kids' biological mother) and the girlfriend. So the intent seems to be about the kids' adjustment and happiness.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is upset because she feels undermined. She might see this conversation as a challenge to her authority or role in the family. However, the author is the parent, and he has a right to communicate with his children without needing permission from his partner. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, especially since the author's intent wasn't to undermine her but to ensure his son's well-being.\n\nAnother angle: The author's previous situation where the girlfriend was asked to take on responsibility (school pickups) led to conflict. The author might be trying to address potential issues early by talking to his son. The fact that the son expressed positive feelings could mean the author's approach helped reassure him. The girlfriend's response might be a reaction to feeling insecure or not trusted, but the author is not obligated to validate his actions with her, especially concerning his children.\n\nPossible issues: Did the author overstep by discussing the girlfriend's role in front of the son? Maybe, but the author claims the conversation was balanced and included the mother's situation as well. Also, the son is 14, old enough to have such discussions with a parent. The girlfriend might be projecting her own insecurities here. \n\nIn terms of relationships, trust is important. The author isn't the one who called the girlfriend an asshole; she called him that initially. Now, she's reacting strongly to the parent-child conversation. The author's actions seem reasonable from a parental standpoint. The girlfriend's need for validation and perceived betrayal might be a bigger issue here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably isn't in the wrong. He's fulfilling his role as a parent by checking in with his child. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her feelings of being undermined and possibly insecurity, but that doesn't make the author at fault.\n"
