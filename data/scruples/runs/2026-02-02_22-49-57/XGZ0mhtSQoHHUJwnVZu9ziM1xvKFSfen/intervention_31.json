My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation is that the author has two sons, and after some criticism from Reddit about the kids possibly sensing the girlfriend's lack of engagement, he decides to talk to his oldest son. The son is happy with things, but the girlfriend is upset and feels undermined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents should be able to talk to their children about various aspects of their lives, including co-parents or step-parents. The author was checking in on his son's well-being, which is a normal and responsible action. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme because she felt betrayed, but the parent's primary duty is to his children's welfare.\n\nHowever, the context includes that the girlfriend was already under stress (job loss, taking on childcare duties) and might be sensitive. The author didn't consult her before the conversation, which could have been a point of communication. But the act of talking to the child isn't inherently wrong. The key is whether the parent overstepped by discussing the girlfriend directly with the child without her consent. But even so, parents often have these discussions without input from the other adult in their lives. The girlfriend's reaction seems more about feeling disrespected rather than the conversation itself being harmful.\n\nThe author mentions that the conversation was also about the mother's absence, so it's not solely about the girlfriend. The parent's intent was to assess the child's feelings, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's claim that it's a betrayal might be an overreaction. So the author isn't in the wrong for trying to ensure his child's happiness and adjustment. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
