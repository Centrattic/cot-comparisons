My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy lives with his girlfriend and his two sons. His ex-wife is away, and he asked his girlfriend to pick up the kids from school, which caused conflict. Then he talked to his oldest son about how he feels, which included the girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset and left, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author thinks he's not wrong because he didn't intend to undermine her and needed to communicate with his kids.\n\nSo, the question is whether talking to his son about his girlfriend was wrong. The author's main point is that as a parent, he should be able to talk to his children without needing permission from his partner. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, feeling betrayed and that he has no confidence in her.\n\nFrom a parenting perspective, it's important to understand how kids are feeling, especially when there are changes in their family dynamics. The author had a valid reason to check in with his son. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that her privacy or role in the family is being questioned without her input. But the author isn't making public criticism or belittling her in front of the child. He's discussing with his child to understand their feelings, which seems like a responsible action.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a communication issue. If the author had discussed this with his girlfriend beforehand, it might have prevented the conflict. But the scenario says the conversation was also about his ex-wife's absence, so maybe he had a right to talk to his son about family matters. The key point is intent: he didn't aim to undermine her. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems over the top, but that doesn't necessarily make the author right. However, given that he's a parent and needs to communicate with his children, I think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to ensure his child's well-being and understanding their thoughts. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her insecurities than the action itself being wrong.\n"
