My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. Let's look at the situation.\n\nThe author has two sons, 8 and 14. He lives with his girlfriend, who recently lost her job and is being supported by him. The girlfriend was supposed to pick up the kids from school, but she called him an asshole when he asked. Comments on Reddit suggested that the kids might sense the girlfriend's reluctance. The author then talks to his oldest son (14) about his feelings regarding his mom being away, the living situation, and his girlfriend. The girlfriend finds out and gets upset, feeling undermined and betrayed, leading her to leave the house.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intention was to check in with his son about his well-being, considering previous feedback about the girlfriend's behavior. The conversation wasn't just about the girlfriend but also about his ex-wife. The girlfriend took it as a personal attack and felt undermined. Now, is the author wrong?\n\nParents often have to talk to their kids about various aspects of their lives, including relationships. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by her sensitivity or lack of communication. The author didn't consult her first, which could be a point of contention. But is that necessary? If a parent wants to discuss their child's feelings about the household, including a stepparent, is that overstepping? \n\nOn one hand, a parent has the right to talk to their children about their well-being. On the other hand, involving a partner in such discussions without their knowledge could be seen as undermining their authority. But the author's intent was to ensure his son's happiness, not to criticize the girlfriend. However, the girlfriend's perception is that she was being evaluated by the son, which might have triggered her insecurities. \n\nThe author argues that he's an adult and should be able to talk to his kids without permission. But the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in front of the child, even with good intentions, could affect the child's view of her. The line between appropriate parental concern and overstepping into relationship dynamics is thin here. \n\nIn similar situations, the advice often given is to communicate openly with the partner first. The author didn't do that, which might have caused unnecessary conflict. However, the necessity of talking to the child about their feelings is also valid. The problem might be more about how the conversation was handled rather than the act itself. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's intentions were good, but the execution might have been lacking in communication with his girlfriend. However, the core action\u2014talking to his son about his perceptions\u2014doesn't inherently make him wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but the author's failure to discuss it with her first could be a misstep. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nGiven the options, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because parents have the right to discuss their children's feelings and well-being, even if it involves their partner. However, the lack of prior communication with the girlfriend is a point of tension. But the primary action of talking to the son isn't wrong.\n"
