My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is a parent living with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job and was asked to help with the kids, which led to conflict. The author then had a conversation with his oldest son about how the son feels about the girlfriend and his mother being away. The girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, saying he undermined her and lacks confidence in her. The author is questioning if he's the asshole (AITA).\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to evaluate whether the author acted appropriately. The key points are:\n\n1. The author's intent was to check in on his son's well-being and see if he was adjusting okay to the living situation. He wasn't trying to criticize the girlfriend but wanted to ensure his son was okay. \n\n2. The conversation was about both the ex-wife (who was away) and the girlfriend. The author is a parent, so talking to his children about family dynamics is a reasonable action.\n\n3. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014leaving the house and saying she needs to rethink the relationship over a conversation between a parent and child. The author didn't go to the son with the intention of undermining the girlfriend; the girlfriend's insecurity might be the issue here.\n\n4. The author is an adult, and the girlfriend is also an adult. The parent should have the right to discuss family matters with his children without needing to consult his partner first. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she might be overreacting or feeling insecure about her role in the family.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: Maybe he should have discussed this with the girlfriend first, considering her feelings. However, as a parent, his primary responsibility is to his children's well-being. The girlfriend's reaction seems disproportionate.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author's action was necessary for the child's emotional health. The author didn't act maliciously; the girlfriend's insecurity might be causing the conflict.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions were reasonable. He was checking on his son, and the girlfriend's overreaction is the problem here. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
