My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted) is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author talked to their son about how the son perceives the author's girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, feeling undermined, and left the house. The author's main point is that they needed to talk to their kids about important family matters, which includes their new partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has two sons, 8 and 14 years old. It's common for parents to discuss family matters with their children, especially when there are significant changes, like a parent moving out or a new caregiver. The author mentioned that they were concerned about the kids' feelings towards the girlfriend after previous comments on their Reddit post. They wanted to check in with the oldest son to ensure he's okay.\n\nThe girlfriend, on the other hand, felt betrayed. She might see the conversation as a challenge to her authority or a lack of trust. But from the author's perspective, they're a parent who needs to communicate openly with their children. The author emphasized that the conversation was about the kids' well-being and their mother being away, not just the girlfriend. \n\nNow, considering the rights and responsibilities here. Parents have the right to talk to their kids about their family life. The author didn't do anything harmful; they had a conversation to address their own concerns about the kids' adjustment. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, possibly because she felt her role as a caregiver was being questioned without her input. However, the author isn't wrong for wanting to ensure their children are comfortable with the living situation.\n\nIt's also important to note that the author didn't share the conversation with the girlfriend first. But the question is, do they need to? As a parent, the children are their responsibility, and discussions about their well-being are part of parenting. The girlfriend might feel insecure, but that doesn't make the author at fault for fulfilling their parental duties.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author acted appropriately in seeking to understand their child's perspective on the new living arrangements. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her feelings of being undermined rather than the author doing something wrong. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
