My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a parent living with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to a conflict where she called him an asshole. After that, he had a conversation with his older son (14) about how the son views the situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and accused him of undermining her and having no confidence in her. Now, the author is questioning if he was wrong to talk to his son about his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents have a duty to check in with their children's well-being. The author was concerned about his son's perception of the girlfriend, possibly because of previous comments from others that the girlfriend's behavior might affect the kids. Talking to his son seems like a reasonable step to ensure the children are okay.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is also valid. She might feel that discussing her with the child without her knowledge could undermine her parental role. But the parent also has a right to discuss the children's feelings without prior approval. The key issue here is whether the parent overstepped by talking to the child about the girlfriend specifically.\n\nIn many cases, parents and their partners should communicate about the children's welfare. However, if the conversation was about the girlfriend's role and the son's feelings towards her, it might have made the girlfriend feel criticized. But the parent's intention was to ensure the child's well-being, not to attack the girlfriend. The parent mentions that the conversation was also about the mother, so maybe the focus wasn't solely on the girlfriend.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of leaving the house and calling it a betrayal might be an overreaction. The parent is not in the wrong for wanting to know how his child perceives the new living situation. It's a balance between maintaining a good relationship with the partner and the responsibility to the children.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parent acted in the best interest of the child, and while the girlfriend's feelings were hurt, the parent's actions were justified. The girlfriend's reaction seems excessive, and the parent should not have to clear every conversation with the partner before talking to his children. The main issue is the girlfriend's insecurity and the need for better communication between the two adults.\n"
