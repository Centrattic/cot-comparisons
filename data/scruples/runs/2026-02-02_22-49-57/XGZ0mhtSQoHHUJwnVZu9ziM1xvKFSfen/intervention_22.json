My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a father, talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, thinking he undermined her. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has two kids with an ex-wife, and he's currently living with his girlfriend, who lost her job. He asked her to help with the kids, which led to conflict. Then he talked to his oldest son about his feelings towards the girlfriend and his mother. The girlfriend took it as a betrayal.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, it's important for parents to discuss their children's well-being and relationships. The author wanted to check in with his son about how he feels about the new living situation and the girlfriend. That seems reasonable. He didn't just talk about the girlfriend; he also discussed his son's mother being away. So maybe he was trying to get a balanced view of his son's feelings.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense. She left the house, feeling betrayed. But as the father, he has a right to talk to his children about their lives and relationships, especially since they are his children. He's the parent, not her. The girlfriend's role might be more about co-parenting if she's involved with the kids, but the main responsibility lies with the biological parent.\n\nHowever, the way he approached it might have been a consideration. Maybe he should have discussed with the girlfriend first about the intention to talk to the kid, to avoid misunderstandings. But the core issue is whether a parent needs permission from a partner to talk to their own children. That seems odd. Parents should have the autonomy to discuss their children's welfare without needing to clear it with a partner. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she might be overreacting, possibly feeling insecure or not confident in her role. The author's intention was to understand his son's perspective, which is a responsible action. The fact that the conversation included both the girlfriend and the mother's absence shows it was about the child's adjustment. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Probably not. He's acting in the best interest of his child by checking in on their feelings, which is a parent's duty. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her insecurities, not the author's wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
