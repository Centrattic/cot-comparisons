My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation is that the author has two kids, an 8-year-old and a 14-year-old. He asked his girlfriend to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, which led to some conflict. Then, after some feedback from Reddit, he sat down with his oldest son (the 14-year-old) to talk about how he's feeling regarding his mom being away, living with the author and the girlfriend, and his thoughts on the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, saying he undermined her and didn't have confidence in her, leading her to leave the house.\n\nSo, the author is asking if he's the asshole here. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents should check in with their kids' well-being, especially when there are significant changes in their lives, like a parent being away or a new partner in the household. The author's intention was to ensure his son was adjusting well, which is a valid concern. It's reasonable for a parent to discuss such matters with their teenager (14 years old) as they can have their own perspectives and feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her authority or role as a step-parent is being questioned. If the author discussed the girlfriend's behavior or role in front of the son, that could be seen as undermining her. However, the author mentions that the conversation was as much about the mother's absence as about the girlfriend. He also didn't consult the girlfriend before talking to the son, which might have been a misstep in communication. But is that a big enough issue to make the author wrong?\n\nThe key points are: the parent's duty to their child's emotional state, the method of communication with the child about the girlfriend, and the handling of the situation with the girlfriend. The parent's action was to check in on the child's feelings, which is a responsible action. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but the parent might have failed to communicate with the girlfriend beforehand, which could have prevented the conflict. However, the parent isn't wrong for wanting to talk to his son about his feelings. The problem might be more about how the girlfriend reacted rather than the parent's action itself.\n\nIn some cases, involving the girlfriend in the conversation about the child's adjustment might have been better, but the parent's primary responsibility is to the child. The girlfriend's reaction seems over the top, but the parent could have handled it differently. However, the core issue is whether talking to the son was wrong, and I don't think it is. So, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
