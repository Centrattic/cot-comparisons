My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after talking to their son about how the son perceives the author's girlfriend. The original situation is that the author's girlfriend lost her job and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to her getting upset. Now, the author had a conversation with their 14-year-old son about the situation, including the girlfriend's role, and the girlfriend found out and reacted negatively, saying he doesn't have confidence in her and that he's acting like a child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries here. The author is a parent and has a responsibility to check in with their children, especially about their well-being and how they're adjusting to the new living arrangements. The kids are 8 and 14, so the 14-year-old is probably old enough to have thoughts and feelings about the new family setup. It's reasonable for a parent to want to gauge their child's adjustment, especially when the child is at an age where they can articulate their feelings.\n\nThe author's intention was to understand how the kids are doing, not to undermine the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling criticized or not trusted. But the parent has the right to communicate openly with their children about family matters. The girlfriend might be projecting her own insecurities or taking it personally, which is a common issue in stepfamily dynamics.\n\nHowever, I should also think about how the conversation was approached. Did the author discuss the girlfriend in a way that was biased or critical? The post says the conversation was as much about the son's mother being away as it was about the girlfriend, which suggests a balanced approach. The parent might have been trying to get a well-rounded view of the situation from the child's perspective.\n\nThe key point here is that the parent is fulfilling their duty to their children's emotional health. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but that doesn't make the parent wrong. The parent is not required to share every conversation with a partner before discussing their children's feelings. The girlfriend's feeling of betrayal might be more about her own insecurities than the parent's actions. \n\nSo, the parent's action is justified. They were checking in with their child about their perception of the new family dynamics, which is a responsible parenting move. The girlfriend's overreaction is her issue, but the parent isn't the asshole here. The answer should be B.\n"
