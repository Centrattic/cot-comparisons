My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about his perceptions of the author's girlfriend. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a dad living with his girlfriend and his two kids. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She got upset and called him an asshole. Then, after some Reddit advice, he talks to his son about how he feels about the situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend finds out and thinks he undermined her, leading to her staying over at a friend's and reevaluating the relationship.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the parent's responsibility to understand their child's feelings and the girlfriend's reaction. The parent had a valid reason to talk to his son about how he's adjusting to the new living situation, especially since the previous Reddit comments suggested that the kids might be picking up on the girlfriend's discomfort. It's a parent's duty to check in with their kids about major life changes affecting them, like moving in with a new partner.\n\nHowever, the parent didn't clear this conversation with the girlfriend first. The girlfriend might feel that her position as a step-parent is being questioned or that her feelings are being prioritized over the kids' well-being. The parent's intention was to ensure the kids are okay, but the girlfriend perceives it as a lack of trust or confidence in her ability to care for the children.\n\nNow, considering the parent's age (44) and the girlfriend's age (32), they are adults and should be able to handle such conversations maturely. The parent argues that he's just doing his job as a parent, which is to communicate with his children about their lives. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her role in the family is being scrutinized without her input.\n\nThe question is whether the parent overstepped by discussing the girlfriend's role without her consent. However, the parent's primary responsibility is to his children. If the kids are affected by the new living arrangements, it's reasonable for the parent to talk to them. The girlfriend's reaction could stem from insecurity or feeling that her role isn't respected. But the parent isn't wrong for wanting to know his child's perspective.\n\nAnother angle: the parent didn't have to involve the girlfriend in the conversation about the kids' feelings. As a parent, he has the right to discuss family dynamics with his children. The girlfriend might need to accept that the parent's primary duty is to his children's well-being. The parent's action doesn't necessarily undermine the girlfriend unless the conversation was meant to criticize her. The parent mentioned the conversation was about both his ex-wife's absence and the girlfriend, indicating a balanced approach.\n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong for talking to his son about how he perceives the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about her own feelings of being undervalued rather than the parent's actions being inherently wrong. The parent should address the relationship dynamics with the girlfriend to ensure mutual understanding, but his initial action of talking to the son isn't the issue.\n"
