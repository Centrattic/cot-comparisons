My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the kid perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is a father living with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job and the author asked her to pick up the kids a few days a week, which led to an argument. Now, the author is concerned about his kids' well-being and decides to talk to his oldest son about how he feels regarding the situation, including his perception of the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed, leading her to leave the house.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the father overstepped by discussing the girlfriend with his son. On one hand, parents have a responsibility to check in with their children about their emotional well-being and family dynamics. It's important for the father to understand how his son is feeling, especially since there was previous concern from the Reddit community about the kids sensing the girlfriend's lack of willingness to be there for them. The father's intention seems to be to ensure his son is okay and not being negatively affected, which is a valid parental concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt her authority or position in the family was being undermined. She might view the conversation as the father not trusting her or questioning her relationship with the kids. However, the father did not go to the son to criticize the girlfriend; he mentioned the conversation was about both the son's mother and the girlfriend. The father also argues that he needs to be able to talk to his children without prior approval from his girlfriend. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the father's action seems to be within his bounds as a parent. The key is intent. If the conversation was meant to support the child and understand his feelings, rather than to criticize the girlfriend, then it's not wrong. The girlfriend's reaction, while strong, might be a result of feeling insecure or not respected, but the father's action itself doesn't cross an ethical line. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the father was acting in his children's best interest and has the right to discuss family matters with them without needing his partner's permission.\n"
