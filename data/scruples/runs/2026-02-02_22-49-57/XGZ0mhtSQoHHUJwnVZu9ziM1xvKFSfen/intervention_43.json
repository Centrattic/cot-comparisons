My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives the author's girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author has two sons, lives with his girlfriend, and she recently lost her job. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to conflict. Then, after considering Reddit users' advice that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of interest in being there for them, the author talks to his oldest son (14-year-old) about his feelings regarding the situation, including his perception of the girlfriend. The girlfriend overhears this and gets upset, feeling undermined and betrayed, leading her to leave the house.\n\nThe author is now being called an asshole for this. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the rights and responsibilities here. The author is a parent, so his primary responsibility is to his children. Checking in on how the children feel about their living situation, including the step-parent, seems like a reasonable parent instinct. The girlfriend feels her boundaries were crossed because he discussed her with the son without consulting her. But parents have a duty to their children's well-being, and it's not uncommon for parents to talk to their kids about family members to understand their perspectives.\n\nHowever, the way the conversation was approached might matter. Did he approach the conversation in a way that could make the girlfriend feel attacked? The author mentions the conversation was about both the mother's absence and the girlfriend. If he was balanced in his approach, that might be different. But the girlfriend's reaction is strong, feeling betrayed and undermined. The key here is whether the parent has the right to discuss the girlfriend with the child without the girlfriend's consent.\n\nIn terms of parental rights, parents generally can talk to their children about family matters. The step-parent relationship is a bit more complex. If the girlfriend is not a legal guardian, perhaps the author has more freedom. However, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in this way is a breach of trust. It's a delicate balance between parental responsibility and respecting the partner's feelings.\n\nBut the core issue is the parent's duty to their children. The author was addressing a potential problem that could affect the child's emotional state. The girlfriend's reaction might be overblown, but it's also valid that she feels disrespected. However, the parent's action isn't inherently wrong. The problem might be more about communication and how the conversation was handled rather than the act itself.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for talking to his son about his perception of the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but the parent's intent was to ensure his child's well-being. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
