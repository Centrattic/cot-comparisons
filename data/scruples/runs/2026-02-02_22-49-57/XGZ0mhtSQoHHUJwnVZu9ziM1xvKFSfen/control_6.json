My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation is that the author has two sons, 8 and 14, and lives with his girlfriend. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, and she got upset, calling him an asshole. Then, he talked to his oldest son about how the son feels about the new arrangement and his girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got even more upset, saying he undermined her and not having confidence in her.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if talking to his son was wrong. The author's intention was to check in on his son's well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. However, the girlfriend felt that this conversation undermined her. The key points here are the parent's responsibility to their children and the boundaries between partners.\n\nOn one hand, parents have the right and duty to discuss their children's feelings and adjust their parenting as needed. The author didn't go to the son to criticize the girlfriend directly but to assess the child's adjustment. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the child without consulting her first could be perceived as not respecting her position as a step-parent or partner.\n\nThe question is whether talking to the son about the girlfriend was an overstep. If the conversation was framed in a way that made the girlfriend feel targeted, then maybe there's a communication issue. But the author's main goal was the son's well-being. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, reacting to a conversation that was part of parenting duties. \n\nIn such cases, it's possible that both parties have valid points. However, the parent's duty to their children generally takes precedence. The author isn't wrong for wanting to ensure his son is okay with the living arrangements. The girlfriend's insecurity might be more about her own feelings in the relationship rather than the action itself. Unless the author was using the child to criticize or undermine the girlfriend, which he states wasn't his intent, he's not in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's fulfilling his role as a parent, and the girlfriend's reaction, while hurtful, doesn't make the author responsible for the conflict unless there's a history of similar issues. The key is the intent and the parent's responsibility.\n"
