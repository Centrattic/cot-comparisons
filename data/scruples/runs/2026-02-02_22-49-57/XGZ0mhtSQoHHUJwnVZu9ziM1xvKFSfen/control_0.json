My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how he perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is a father of two boys, 8 and 14, living with his girlfriend. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to a conflict. The author then had a conversation with his oldest son (14) about his feelings towards the girlfriend and his mother. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nThe key points here are the parent's right to talk to their child about family dynamics and the girlfriend's reaction. The author argues that he needed to check in with his child to ensure he wasn't being negatively affected by the situation. The girlfriend, however, sees it as a breach of trust and a lack of confidence in her.\n\nFrom a child's well-being perspective, parents often need to have these conversations to understand their children's feelings, especially when there are changes in the family structure, like a step-parent situation. The author didn't mention the girlfriend first, but he did have a legitimate reason related to their children's emotional state.\n\nHowever, the way the conversation was handled might be a point of contention. Did the author consider the girlfriend's feelings before discussing her with the son? If the author didn't discuss it with the girlfriend first, even though the children's welfare is a priority, it might have come off as not respecting her role in the household. But the main responsibility of a parent is to their children.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. Adults in a relationship should generally respect each other's roles, but the father has a duty to his children. The author isn't trying to undermine the girlfriend; he's addressing his child's well-being. The girlfriend's insecurity might be part of the issue here, but that doesn't mean the author was wrong to talk to his son.\n\nSo, considering the parent's responsibility and the lack of malicious intent from the author, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong). The girlfriend's reaction is more about her own feelings of being undermined rather than a justified response to a parent fulfilling their duty.\n"
