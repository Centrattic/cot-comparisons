My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author talked to their son about how the son perceives the girlfriend. The girlfriend got really upset, feeling undermined. The author argues that they needed to talk to their kids without permission from the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has two sons, and as a parent, they have a responsibility to check in with their children's well-being. The son was happy with the current situation, but the girlfriend is now upset because the author discussed her with the child. The key point is whether discussing the children's feelings with them is acceptable without the girlfriend's consent.\n\nThe author mentions that the conversation was about both the ex-wife and the girlfriend. They argue that they needed to ensure the kids are okay, which is a parent's duty. However, the girlfriend feels betrayed and undermined, which is a valid emotional response. But does the author have the right to talk to their children about their other parent without the current partner's approval? \n\nIn co-parenting situations, especially when a new partner is involved, communication can be tricky. The author might have thought it was necessary to address the child's perspective, especially after feedback from others suggested the kids might be affected. But the girlfriend's reaction suggests she feels her role as a step-parent is being questioned or criticized without her being part of the conversation.\n\nOn one hand, parents should be able to talk to their children about their relationships without needing permission from a partner. On the other hand, involving the child in discussions about the parent's new partner might make the partner feel disrespected or not trusted. The author didn't go to the child to undermine the girlfriend, but the girlfriend perceived it as such. \n\nHowever, considering the best interest of the children, it's important for the parent to be open with them. The author's intention was to assess the kids' well-being, which is a valid reason. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or a need for validation, but the author isn't wrong for wanting to ensure their children are okay. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a cultural or social norm that suggests discussing a partner with the kids requires mutual agreement. In many cases, parents have the right to talk to their kids about their relationships, especially when it affects the children. The girlfriend's reaction seems overblown, but it's a valid emotional response. However, the author's action was necessary for the kids' sake.\n"
