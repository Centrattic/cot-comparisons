My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves the author discussing with his oldest son (14 years old) about his feelings towards his girlfriend and his mother's absence. The girlfriend reacted strongly, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. The parent wanted to check in on his son's well-being, especially after previous comments suggested the kids might be picking up on the girlfriend's negative attitude. It's a common concern for parents to want to know how their children feel about those in their lives, especially when those people are living in the same house. The parent's intention was to ensure the child's happiness and to address any potential issues early, which is a responsible approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt that the parent didn't have confidence in her and that he betrayed her by discussing her with the son. The parent didn't mention to the girlfriend that he was going to talk to the son about her, which might be why she felt blindsided. The parent argues that he's an adult and should be able to speak with his children without needing permission from his partner. This is a valid point, especially since the children are his responsibility, and their well-being is a priority.\n\nHowever, I should consider the dynamics of the relationship. The girlfriend is living in the same house, and the parent's decision to discuss her with the son without informing her could be seen as a breach of trust. The parent might have handled it differently by including the girlfriend in the conversation or at least discussing the intention with her first. But given that the main issue was the son's perception, the parent's primary duty is to his child's emotional health.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but it's possible she feels insecure or threatened. The parent's action was not malicious, and the intent was to check on the child's feelings. The parent is justified in wanting to maintain a positive environment for his children. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
