My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves a complex family dynamic: the man lives with his girlfriend, his two sons, and the sons' mother (ex?) is away. The girlfriend recently lost her job and he supports her, but she's been upset when he asked her to help with the kids. The author then talks to his oldest son (14) about his feelings towards his mother's absence and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents have a duty to check in with their children about major life changes, like moving in with a new partner or a parent being away. The son is 14, old enough to have opinions, so discussing feelings is appropriate. The author mentions that he was advised before that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm, so he wanted to confirm if that was the case. His intent wasn't to undermine the girlfriend but to ensure the kids are okay.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend felt betrayed because he discussed her with the son without her knowledge. The key here is whether the parent had the right to have that conversation. Since he is the parent, it's generally his role to address his children's well-being. But maybe he should have been more sensitive about how he approached it. But the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014storming out and threatening to rethink the relationship over a conversation about the kids' feelings. \n\nThe author is an adult, and talking to his kids is part of parenting. Unless there's a legal issue or a prior agreement not to discuss the girlfriend with the kids, the parent is justified. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling that her position is being questioned. However, the parent's actions were in the best interest of the children. \n\nThe main question is about the parent's right to parent. Unless the girlfriend has custody rights or legal guardianship over the children (which isn't indicated), the parent can make decisions about his children's welfare. The girlfriend's feeling of being undermined is valid, but the parent's responsibility to the kids takes precedence. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parent acted appropriately in checking on his child's well-being, and the girlfriend's reaction seems disproportionate. However, maybe the parent could have handled the discussion differently, but the act itself isn't wrong.\n"
