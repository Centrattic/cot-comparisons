My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about his girlfriend. The situation involves a father who lives with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend lost her job and was supposed to pick up the kids from school but got upset when the father asked her to do that. Now, the father talked to his oldest son about how he feels about the current living situation and the girlfriend, which led to the girlfriend being upset and leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's intent. He mentioned he had a wake-up call from comments about his kids sensing the girlfriend's lack of interest. He wanted to check in with his son to make sure things are okay, which seems like a responsible action as a parent. The conversation was also about the mother (his ex?) being away, so it's not solely about the girlfriend. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014she feels undermined and the father is called immature. But is the father wrong for talking to his son? Parents often discuss various topics with their kids, including relationships and family dynamics. Unless there's a prior agreement not to discuss partners, it's reasonable for a parent to have such conversations to understand their child's perspective.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be overblown. The father is fulfilling his duty to ensure his children's well-being, which includes understanding their feelings about all family members. The girlfriend might feel threatened or untrusted, but the father's action doesn't seem malicious. The key point is whether the conversation was necessary and respectful. Since the father's intention was to check in on his son's well-being, not to criticize the girlfriend, he's probably not in the wrong. \n\nHowever, communication between the father and girlfriend is also important. Maybe the father should have discussed this with her first, but the scenario doesn't indicate that he did something wrong by directly talking to his son. The girlfriend's reaction could stem from her own insecurities or stress from job loss, which is her issue to manage. \n\nIn conclusion, the father's actions were aimed at ensuring his child's emotional health, which is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend's overreaction doesn't necessarily make the father the asshole here. So the answer is B.\n"
