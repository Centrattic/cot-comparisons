My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for talking to his son about his girlfriend. The main points here are that the author wanted to check in with his son about how he feels regarding his stepmom and his mom being away. The girlfriend got upset, feeling undermined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents have a duty to ensure their children's well-being and emotional health. If there were concerns about the kids' feelings towards the new partner, talking to them makes sense. The author mentions that others pointed out the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of willingness, which the author hadn't considered before. So, the conversation was likely motivated by concern for the kids, not to criticize the girlfriend.\n\nHowever, the way the conversation was approached might have affected the girlfriend. The author didn't consider how the girlfriend would perceive this. Even though the parent-child conversation is normal, the girlfriend might feel that the parent is questioning her role or their relationship. It's possible that the author didn't communicate his intentions clearly, leading to her feeling undermined.\n\nBut the key point is that parents should be able to talk to their kids about family matters without needing permission. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, especially since the conversation was also about the kids' mother being away, not just the girlfriend. The author is an adult and should have the right to discuss his children's feelings with them. The girlfriend's taking it as a betrayal might indicate her own insecurities rather than the parent's wrongdoing.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have discussed with the girlfriend first? But that's not typically how parent-child communication works. Parents don't usually need a partner's approval to talk to their kids. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about her own feelings of insecurity or not feeling trusted, which is her issue, not the author's.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's action was appropriate for a parent wanting to check in with their child. The girlfriend's overreaction is her problem, not his. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
