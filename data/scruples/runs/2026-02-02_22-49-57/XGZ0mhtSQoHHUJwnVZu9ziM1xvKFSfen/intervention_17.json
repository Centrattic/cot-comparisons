My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context from the previous Reddit post: The author lives with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to help with the kids, which led to conflict. Comments suggested the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm. The author then talks to his oldest son about his feelings regarding the situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend finds out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's intention was to check in with his son about his well-being, considering the previous feedback. He mentions the conversation was about both the ex-wife (who's away) and the girlfriend. The girlfriend reacts strongly, feeling that her position is being questioned.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, parents do have the right to discuss their children's feelings and family dynamics. However, the way the conversation was framed could be an issue. If the author didn't go into the conversation with the intent to undermine the girlfriend, but the girlfriend interpreted it that way, there's a communication gap. The author might not have considered how his actions could be perceived by the girlfriend, even if his intent was good. However, the girlfriend's overreaction seems extreme. Parents should be able to talk to their kids without needing permission from a partner. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But there's a need for better communication between the author and his girlfriend to prevent such misunderstandings. The answer is probably B, he's not the asshole.\n"
