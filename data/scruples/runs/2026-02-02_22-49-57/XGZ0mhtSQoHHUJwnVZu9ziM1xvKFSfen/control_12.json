My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives him and his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the context: The author has two kids, 8 and 14, and lives with his girlfriend. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days. She was upset and called him an asshole. Then, he had a conversation with his oldest son (14) about how he feels about his mom being away and his thoughts on the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and was furious, feeling undermined and that he lacks confidence in her. She left the house to stay with a friend and wants to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he needed to talk to his kids about their well-being, especially since the previous Reddit comments suggested the kids might be picking up on negative dynamics. He felt it was necessary to check in with them and didn't do it to undermine the girlfriend. He's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. As a parent, it's important to communicate with children about family dynamics to ensure their emotional well-being. The author's intention was to assess how the kids are feeling, which is a responsible action. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt this conversation was a betrayal or a lack of trust.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. While the author had the right to talk to his son about family matters, he should have considered how his girlfriend might perceive this. The girlfriend might feel that discussing her in a private conversation with the child, especially about her role in the family, could make her feel undermined or not trusted. Even if the conversation wasn't meant to criticize her, the way it's framed or who is included can matter.\n\nBut the author's main concern was the children's well-being. The question is whether talking to his son about how the son perceives the girlfriend is inherently wrong. Since the children are his responsibility, he needs to communicate with them about their family situation. However, ideally, a conversation like that should involve both parents if possible, but given that he's the parent living with the kids, he might need to handle it independently.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but her feelings are valid in that she might feel the conversation was a challenge to her authority or a sign of distrust. However, the author's action was to check in on his son's feelings, which is a parental duty. The problem might be more about communication between the couple. The author didn't necessarily do anything wrong, but he could have handled it more sensitively. He should have maybe discussed with the girlfriend first, but it's not clear if that's a requirement in all situations. Since the kids are his children, he has the right to communicate with them about their family.\n\nSo, considering all points, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
