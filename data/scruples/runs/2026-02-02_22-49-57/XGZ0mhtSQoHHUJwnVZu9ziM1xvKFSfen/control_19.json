My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The man lives with his girlfriend and his two kids. He asked her to pick up the kids from school, but she got upset. Then, after some feedback from others, he talked to his oldest son (14) about how he feels about the situation, including his mom being away and his girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is now angry, feeling undermined. The author thinks he's not wrong because he needed to talk to his kids, but the girlfriend is upset.\n\nSo, the main question is: Should the father have discussed his girlfriend with his son without consulting her first? \n\nFrom a parenting perspective, talking to your child about their feelings and the people in their lives (like a new partner) is often important for the child's well-being. It's part of guiding them and understanding their emotions. The father might have valid reasons to check in with his son, especially after others suggested the child might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is also significant. She might feel that discussing her with the child without her input could affect the child's perception of her, or she might feel disrespected. But, the father is the child's parent; he has a right to discuss family matters with his children. Unless he was being malicious or negative, just having the conversation shouldn't be considered wrong. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or relational norm here. If the parents had agreed not to discuss the partner with the kids, that's different. But the author didn't mention any prior agreement. The key is whether the conversation was necessary for the child's well-being and if it was done in a respectful way. The author says the conversation was about the mother's absence and the girlfriend, and the son was happy. So the intent was to check on the child's feelings, not to undermine the girlfriend. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The father might have handled it better by discussing with the girlfriend first, but the need to talk to his son about his adjustment might outweigh that. The girlfriend's reaction seems over the top if the conversation was neutral and aimed at the child's well-being. \n\nSo, the father is not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
