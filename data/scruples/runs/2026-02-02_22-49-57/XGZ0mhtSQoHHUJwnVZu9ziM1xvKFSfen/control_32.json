My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a man talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The man has two kids and a live-in girlfriend. He asked her to help with the kids, which led to a conflict. He then talked to his oldest son (14) about how he feels about the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined. Now, the question is whether the author did something wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the parent's right to talk to his children versus the girlfriend's feelings. Parents generally have a responsibility to check in with their kids about their well-being and relationships, especially when there's a new significant other. The son is 14, old enough to have an opinion and to discuss such matters. The author mentions that the conversation was about both the ex and the girlfriend, not just the girlfriend. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend felt betrayed and undermined. The issue here is whether the parent should have discussed the girlfriend with the son without her knowledge. But since the parent's primary responsibility is to the children, talking to them about how they feel in the household is part of being a responsible parent. The girlfriend's reaction might be overly sensitive, but the parent isn't wrong for wanting to ensure his son is comfortable.\n\nAnother angle is that the parent didn't talk to the son to undermine the girlfriend but to understand his feelings. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, especially since the conversation was about the son's own experiences, which is a parent's right. The author is an adult, and so is the girlfriend, so the parent shouldn't need permission to talk to his own child.\n\nIn child custody situations, courts often encourage parents to talk to their children about their living arrangements. This is about the well-being of the kids. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or a lack of trust, but the parent isn't wrong for wanting to make sure the kids are okay. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. He's a parent ensuring his child's comfort and well-being, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her own insecurities rather than the parent's wrongdoing.\n"
