My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation is that the author has two sons, lives with his girlfriend, and her job loss led to her being less available. He asked her to watch the kids a few days a week, which she took badly. He then talked to his oldest son (14) about how he feels about the situation, the mother being away, and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, saying he undermined her and left the house. The author feels he's not the asshole because he needed to talk to his kids without clearing it with her first.\n\nI need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, he's talking to his own child about his relationships and family dynamics. Parents often discuss such matters with their kids to understand their well-being. However, the girlfriend feels it's an undermining move. The key points are:\n\n1. The author's intent was to check in on his son's feelings, not to undermine the girlfriend. The conversation included topics about his ex-wife and the current girlfriend.\n2. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, interpreting the conversation as a lack of trust.\n3. The author argues that as a parent, he should be able to discuss family matters with his children without needing permission.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, talking to kids about their family, including stepparents, can be necessary for understanding their emotional state. However, the approach might matter. If the conversation was critical of the girlfriend in front of the child, that could be problematic. But the author states the intent was neutral and included talking about the mother being away. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she feels disrespected, but the author's actions seem within his rights as a parent. The key is whether the conversation was constructive and respectful. Since the author didn't go into the conversation to criticize the girlfriend but to understand his son's perspective, it's more about the father's responsibility than disloyalty. The girlfriend's overreaction might stem from feeling insecure, but the author isn't wrong for engaging with his child. So the answer is B.\n"
