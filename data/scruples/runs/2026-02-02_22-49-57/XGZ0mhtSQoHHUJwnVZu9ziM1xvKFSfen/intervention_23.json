My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a father living with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She called him an asshole. Then, the author had a conversation with his son to understand how the son feels about the situation, including his thoughts about the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nThe key points here are: the father's intention was to check in with his son about his well-being, especially since previous comments suggested the kids might sense tension. He didn't want to hurt the girlfriend, but he believes he needs to be able to talk to his kids without needing permission. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels her authority is being undermined.\n\nSo, from a parental perspective, is it wrong to talk to your child about their perception of a stepparent? Well, children need open communication with their parents. If the father is concerned about the child's adjustment and well-being, that conversation is important. The father's action was to assess if the child is okay, which is a responsible parent thing to do.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She feels betrayed and accuses the father of not having confidence in her. The issue here might be how the conversation was conducted. Did the father approach it in a way that was critical of the girlfriend, or was it neutral? The father says it was as much about the mother as the girlfriend. If the conversation was balanced, maybe the girlfriend's reaction is over the top. But if it was framed in a way that made the child feel like he was being asked to compare or judge the girlfriend, that could be problematic.\n\nBut the father's intention was to ensure his son's well-being. Parents have the right to discuss their children's feelings and adjust their parenting accordingly. The girlfriend might need to realize that the father can have a relationship with his children that includes discussing their perspectives without it being a personal attack. However, maybe the father should have considered discussing this with the girlfriend first, especially if they are co-parenting. But the father argues that he shouldn't have to clear conversations with her. It's a delicate balance between respecting co-parent boundaries and the child's need for open communication.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the father's action seems justified from a parent's standpoint. He was checking in with his child's welfare. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or fear of not being accepted by the child. The father isn't in the wrong for having a necessary conversation with his son. The problem might be in the girlfriend's reaction rather than the father's action. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
