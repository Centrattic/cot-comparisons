My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, context from the original Reddit post: The man lives with his girlfriend and his two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She reacted negatively, calling him an asshole. Now, he decided to talk to his oldest son (14) about how the kid feels regarding his mom being away and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed, leading her to leave the house and consider the relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wanted to check in on his son's feelings, which the commenters on his previous post had warned about. He didn't intend to undermine the girlfriend, and he thinks he's not wrong because he's a parent who needs to communicate with his kids without needing permission from his partner.\n\nNow, considering the situation, is the author in the wrong? Well, as a parent, he has a responsibility to ensure his children's well-being emotionally and psychologically. Talking to them about their feelings is part of that. However, the girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that her role as a stepmother or caregiver is being questioned. But does the father need her permission to discuss his kids' feelings? Generally, parents have the right to talk to their children about family dynamics. However, the way the conversation was approached might have caused offense. If there was no prior agreement on how to handle discussions about the girlfriend, it's possible that the father didn't consider her perspective enough. But given that the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014calling it betrayal and saying the relationship needs rethinking\u2014maybe the father overstepped in some way. However, in most cases, parents should be able to speak with their children without needing consent from a partner. The girlfriend's insecurity or feeling undermined might be the root issue here. The father's intention was to check on his son's well-being, which is appropriate. Unless there's a prior agreement that such conversations require consultation, which isn't mentioned, the father isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
