My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, thinking he undermined her. The author's reasoning is that he needed to check in with his children about their well-being, especially considering the girlfriend's recent job loss and the previous tension mentioned in the previous Reddit post.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The parent has a responsibility to ensure their children are comfortable and adjusting well, especially when there are changes in the family structure, like a new partner moving in. The author mentions that the conversation wasn't just about the girlfriend but also about the mother being away. That's important because it shows the discussion wasn't solely critical of the girlfriend but also addressed other family matters.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. She accused him of lacking confidence in her and called him immature. However, parents generally have the right to talk to their children about various aspects of their lives, including their relationships with other family members. The key question is whether the author's conversation was done in a respectful and constructive manner. The author states that the son was happy with the current situation, so the conversation was more of a check-in rather than a critique.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective matters too. If she felt that her role in the family was being questioned, that's a valid concern. But the author isn't criticizing her in front of the child; he's seeking the child's honest opinion to ensure their well-being. The author also mentions that the conversation was necessary because others had pointed out that the kids might sense tension. Acting on that advice is responsible parenting.\n\nThe issue here is communication. The author didn't discuss his intention to talk to the son with his girlfriend first, which might have caused her to feel blindsided. However, expecting a parent to discuss every conversation with their partner before talking to their children might be unrealistic. Parents need autonomy in parenting decisions, especially when it involves their children's emotional well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author could have handled it better by considering his girlfriend's feelings and perhaps discussing his intent with her first, the act of talking to his son about his perceptions is not inherently wrong. The primary responsibility is to the children's welfare. The girlfriend's reaction seems overblown, but the author's approach was in the best interest of the children. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
