My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author talked to their son about how the kid perceives the author's girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset and left, thinking the author undermined her. The author's defense is that they needed to talk to their kids about their living situation and the girlfriend's role, and they didn't think it was necessary to clear it with her first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' responsibility to communicate with their children. The author mentions that many Reddit commenters warned them about the kids sensing the girlfriend's lack of commitment. So they had a valid reason to check in with their son. The author also states the conversation was about both the ex-mother and the girlfriend, not just the girlfriend. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend felt betrayed and undermined. The key point here is whether discussing the girlfriend with the child is an overstep, especially since the child is 8 and 14 years old. The older one is 14, so maybe he can handle such a conversation. But maybe the author didn't consider how the girlfriend would react. \n\nThe author argues that they need to talk to their kids without permission. That makes sense because parents should have autonomy in discussing family matters with their children. But the way the conversation was framed might have been problematic. Was the author more critical of the girlfriend or just asking the child's opinion? The post mentions the son had valid thoughts and was happy, so maybe the author didn't criticize the girlfriend. Still, the girlfriend took it as a betrayal.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014leaving and needing to rethink the relationship. That's a big response, possibly indicating deeper issues in the relationship. The author might have triggered something, but the girlfriend's reaction is out of proportion if the conversation was neutral. \n\nIn terms of rights, the author has the right to discuss their children's well-being with them. However, considering the girlfriend's feelings, maybe the author should have discussed it with her first, even if they don't have to. It's about communication and mutual respect. The author didn't intend to undermine, but the effect was there. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer is B. They didn't do anything wrong, but maybe could have handled it better. But ultimately, the girlfriend overreacted. The author's actions were reasonable to ensure their child's well-being.\n"
