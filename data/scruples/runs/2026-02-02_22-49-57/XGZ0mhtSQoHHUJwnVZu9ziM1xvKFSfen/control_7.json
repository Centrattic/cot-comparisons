My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a 44-year-old man, has a son and a daughter, both with their biological mom. The biological mom isn't around much, so the dad has his current girlfriend living with them. The girlfriend lost her job, and the dad asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She got really upset and called him an asshole. Then, the dad talked to his oldest son (14 years old) about how the boy feels regarding the girlfriend and his mom being away. The girlfriend found out and is now upset, saying he undermined her and lacks confidence in her. She left to stay with a friend and is rethinking the relationship.\n\nSo, the question is whether the dad did the wrong thing by talking to his son about his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, as a parent, it's important to check in with the kids about their feelings, especially regarding major life changes like a new caregiver or a parent being away. The dad mentions that some Reddit comments pointed out that the kids might sense the girlfriend isn't fully there. He wanted to make sure the kids were okay. That seems like a responsible action as a parent. The son was happy, which is a relief. \n\nBut the girlfriend is upset that the dad talked to the son about her. She feels undermined and betrayed. The dad argues that he's an adult and should be able to talk to his kids without needing permission. He didn't mean to undermine her; the conversation was also about the son's mom being away. \n\nSo, is the dad wrong? Well, talking to your kids about their feelings and the people in their lives is a normal part of parenting. The dad didn't lie or badmouth the girlfriend; he just asked the son his thoughts. The girlfriend's reaction seems a bit over the top. However, maybe the dad should have considered discussing the conversation with the girlfriend beforehand, especially if the girlfriend is a co-parent in the household. Even though the dad isn't the biological parent, he's the one living with the kids and has to manage their well-being. The girlfriend might feel that her role is being questioned, but the dad's duty is to his children's emotional state. \n\nOn the other hand, the dad could have approached it differently. Maybe he should have explained his intentions after the conversation to the girlfriend, to avoid misunderstandings. The girlfriend's reaction of storming out and threatening to leave seems extreme, but her perception is that her authority or role is being undermined. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the dad's intention was to check on his son's well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction is more about feeling disrespected. However, since they are in a relationship, communication is key. The dad could have been more transparent with the girlfriend about his intention to talk to the son, but that doesn't necessarily make him in the wrong. The key is that the dad's action was for the child's benefit, not to undermine the girlfriend. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He acted in his child's best interest, which is a parent's duty. The girlfriend's overreaction is a separate issue, and the dad isn't wrong for doing his parental duty without prior approval from his partner.\n"
