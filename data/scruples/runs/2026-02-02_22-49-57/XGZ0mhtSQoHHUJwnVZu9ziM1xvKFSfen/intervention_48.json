My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a father who lives with his girlfriend and two sons. He's had a previous situation where he asked his girlfriend to pick up his kids from school, which led to conflict. Now, he's talking to his oldest son about how the son perceives the girlfriend and his mother's absence. The girlfriend got upset and left, feeling undermined.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is wrong for having that conversation. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. \n\nFirst, the father's intention was to check in with his son about his feelings regarding the family dynamics, both the girlfriend and the mother. It's important for a parent to know how their children feel, especially when there are changes in the family structure. The father didn't go to the son to badmouth the girlfriend; the conversation was balanced. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend might feel that being discussed without her knowledge is a breach of trust. But as the father, he has a right to communicate with his children about their home life. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but does that make the father wrong? \n\nThe key points: The father's action was in the best interest of his child's well-being. He's an adult, as is the girlfriend, so they should handle adult situations. The conversation wasn't malicious. The girlfriend's response might be overreacting, but the father isn't necessarily the asshole here. \n\nSo, probably B is the right answer. The author isn't in the wrong. He's fulfilling his role as a parent by ensuring his child's feelings are considered.\n"
