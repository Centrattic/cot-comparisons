My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The author's context is that he lives with his girlfriend and his two kids. His girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, which led to a conflict. Then, he talked to his oldest son about his feelings towards the new living situation and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intention was to check in with his son about how he's coping with the changes, which is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend took offense, interpreting it as a lack of confidence in her. The author argues that he's just doing his job as a parent, talking to his kids without needing permission from his partner. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics, the author is right to prioritize his children's well-being. Parents should be able to discuss their kids' feelings without interference. However, the way the conversation was handled might have been an issue. Did he discuss the girlfriend in a negative light? The original post says the conversation was about both the mother's absence and the girlfriend, suggesting he was trying to understand the son's perspective rather than criticizing the girlfriend. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems over the top. If the author's goal was to support his son, then it's reasonable. The girlfriend's taking offense could indicate insecurity or a lack of trust in the relationship. But the author's actions themselves\u2014talking to his son\u2014aren't inherently wrong. It's a parent's duty to communicate with their children. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have discussed this with his girlfriend first, but the scenario doesn't mention any prior communication issues. The author mentions that he talked to his son because others suggested the kids might sense the girlfriend's reluctance. So it was a proactive step, not a passive-aggressive one. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions were in the best interest of his child, not to undermine his girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her own feelings than the author's wrongdoing. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
