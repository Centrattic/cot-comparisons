My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, feeling undermined and that her partner doesn't trust her.\n\nSo, the author's side is that he's a parent who wants to check in with his kids, especially since they were mentioned in previous discussions about the girlfriend's behavior. He thought it was important to ensure the kids were okay. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels betrayed because he discussed her without consulting her first.\n\nHmm. From a parent's perspective, talking to your children about their relationships with other adults in their lives is usually considered normal. Parents need to be aware of how their kids feel about people in their household. But the girlfriend might see it as a breach of privacy or trust, especially if she's a step-parent or in a new relationship. \n\nThe key points here: Did the author have a right to talk to his son about the girlfriend? Well, since the kids are his, he should be able to discuss them to some extent. However, maybe the approach could have been different. Like, maybe he could have involved the girlfriend first or framed the conversation in a way that didn't make her feel criticized. \n\nBut the author says he didn't intend to undermine her. The conversation was about the kids' well-being, not just the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but her feelings are valid because she might feel her position is being questioned. \n\nWait, but the author mentions that previous comments on his Reddit post suggested that the kids might be sensing the girlfriend's lack of commitment. So he acted on that advice to check in with his son. That seems like a responsible action. \n\nOn the flip side, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her without her input is disrespectful. There's a balance between a parent's right to know their children's feelings and respecting the partner's feelings. \n\nI think the author isn't wrong for wanting to talk to his son. Parents need to be proactive about their children's emotions. However, maybe he could have handled it more sensitively. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he acted out of concern for his kids and the conversation was valid, I lean towards answer B, he's not the asshole.\n"
