My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives the author's girlfriend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author lives with his girlfriend and two sons. The older son is 14. The author had a previous issue where the girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to help pick up the kids from school, which led to a conflict. Now, he's concerned about how his children view the situation, especially after people on Reddit mentioned the kids might pick up on negative behaviors. He then talks to his oldest son about his feelings towards his mom (the author's ex?), his mother being away, and his thoughts on the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed, leading her to leave the house. The author argues that he needed to talk to his son to ensure the kids' well-being and that it wasn't just about the girlfriend.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intent was to check in on his son's feelings and ensure he's not hurting his kids by the current living arrangements. He didn't go to the son to badmouth the girlfriend but to discuss the situation as a whole. The girlfriend feels betrayed and that her position is being undermined. The author's stance is that he's an adult with kids and should be able to talk to them about important matters without needing permission from his girlfriend.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: Is it the father's responsibility to talk to his children about their family dynamics, including a step-parent? Generally, yes. Parents need to communicate with their kids about family matters, especially when there are changes in the family structure. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but perhaps she felt insecure or threatened by the conversation. However, the father's action seems justified as part of his parental duty. The problem might be how the conversation was handled or the lack of prior communication with the girlfriend about his intentions. But given that he's the parent, he has the right to discuss family matters with his children. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). However, there's a need to consider if there was a way to approach it without hurting the girlfriend's feelings, but the act itself isn't wrong.\n"
