My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the context: The author has two sons, aged 8 and 14, and a girlfriend. The girlfriend lost her job, and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to a conflict. Now, the author had a conversation with his oldest son (14) about his feelings towards the girlfriend and his mother being away. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and that the author lacks confidence in her. She left the house and wants to reevaluate the relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he needed to talk to his son about the situation, considering the previous advice from Reddit about kids sensing tension. He didn't think he needed to clear it with his girlfriend first. The key points here are: the parent's responsibility to communicate with their child, the girlfriend's reaction, and whether the author overstepped.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, talking to one's child about family dynamics is generally seen as appropriate. Parents often discuss various aspects of their lives with their children to understand their well-being. The author's intention was to check in on his son's feelings, which is a responsible action. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, especially since the conversation was about her and the kids' mother. However, the author didn't involve her in the discussion, which could be seen as a breach of trust or partnership in the relationship.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, as a parent, he has the right to communicate with his children. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that her role in the family is being questioned without her input. However, if the conversation was about the child's perceptions and not a criticism of the girlfriend, the author might not be at fault. The line is blurry here. If the son expressed concerns about the girlfriend, the parent might have a responsibility to address those concerns, but the parent should also consider the girlfriend's feelings. However, the parent isn't the one who should need permission to talk to their own child. \n\nIn many cases, parents are encouraged to have open lines of communication with their children. The girlfriend's reaction seems more about feeling undermined rather than the parent's duty. The author didn't go into the conversation with malice but to ensure the child's well-being. So, while the girlfriend's feelings are valid, the parent's action isn't necessarily wrong. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
