My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the man lives with his girlfriend and his two sons. His girlfriend lost her job and he asked her to pick up the kids sometimes, which led to conflict. Then he sat down with his oldest son to talk about how he feels about his mom being away and what he thinks about the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and was upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. Now, the author is asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points are: talking to his son about the girlfriend, which the girlfriend took as a betrayal. The man argues that he needed to talk to his kids without clearing it with her first, and the conversation was about both the ex-wife and the girlfriend. \n\nHmm. From a parenting perspective, it's generally considered important for parents to communicate with their children, especially about family dynamics. The man might have thought it necessary to check in with his son about how he's adjusting to the new living situation. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also valid because she might feel that discussing her in front of the child could affect the child's perception or undermine her authority. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, the action itself\u2014talking to his son\u2014is a parental duty. The problem might be the way he approached it or whether he considered the girlfriend's feelings. If the son was old enough (he's 14), discussing family matters is appropriate. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, maybe overreacting, but that doesn't necessarily mean the father is wrong. \n\nSome might argue that discussing a partner with the child could create unnecessary pressure on the partner. However, the father's intention was to check in on his child's well-being, which is a valid reason. The girlfriend's insecurity or feeling undermined might be her own issue, but the father's action isn't inherently wrong. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the father might not be in the wrong for having the conversation. The girlfriend's reaction is problematic, but the act of talking to his son is a responsible parenting decision. Therefore, the answer is probably B (No).\n"
