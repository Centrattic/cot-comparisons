My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves the author having a conversation with his oldest son, which was about the son's mother being away and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got upset, accusing the author of undermining her and lacking confidence in her. The author's reasoning is that he needed to talk to his kids without needing permission, especially regarding their well-being and family dynamics.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Parents have a responsibility to check in with their children's feelings, especially when there are significant changes in the family structure, like living with a new partner. The author's intention was to ensure his son's perspective was heard, which seems reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling criticized or not trusted, but the author's action was about his children's welfare.\n\nHowever, maybe the way the conversation was approached could be a factor. Did the author ask the son about the girlfriend in a way that was critical or neutral? The post mentions the son was happy with the situation, so the conversation might have been balanced. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but that doesn't necessarily make the author right. The key point is whether talking to the son about the girlfriend inherently undermines her. If the author's intention was purely to understand his son's feelings and not to criticize the girlfriend, then it's a valid parental action. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in front of the child without her knowledge could affect the child's perception. However, the author is the parent, so discussing family matters with his children is within his rights. The girlfriend's reaction might be about feeling excluded or not trusted, but the parent's duty to his children takes precedence. \n\nIn terms of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" framework, the community often considers intentions and potential harm. The author's intent was to check on his son's well-being, which is a responsible action. The girlfriend's overreaction might be her issue, not the author's wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
