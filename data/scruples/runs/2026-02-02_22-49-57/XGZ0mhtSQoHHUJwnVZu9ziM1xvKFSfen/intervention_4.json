My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the Reddit post) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author lives with his girlfriend and his two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, which led to a conflict where she called him an asshole. Then, the author, after reading comments on Reddit, decided to talk to his oldest son about how he feels regarding the situation\u2014his mother being away, the new living arrangement, and his perception of the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and was upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intention in talking to his son. The author mentions that he wanted to check in with his son about how he's feeling, not to undermine the girlfriend. He also states that the conversation was about both the mother's absence and the girlfriend. The girlfriend, however, felt that this conversation was a criticism of her and a lack of confidence in her ability to care for the kids.\n\nNow, considering the parent's responsibility: Parents need to be aware of their children's well-being and feelings, especially in a blended family situation where the children have a new caregiver. It's reasonable for a parent to talk to their child about how they feel about the new living arrangements and the people involved. The author didn't go to the child to criticize the girlfriend but to understand the child's perspective. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is also valid because she might feel that the parent is not supporting her, especially given the previous conflict. The way the conversation was approached might have been sensitive. Maybe the author could have discussed it with the girlfriend first to avoid her misunderstanding. But the author argues that he needed to talk to his son without clearing it with the girlfriend first because it's about his child's feelings. \n\nIn terms of parental rights, parents generally have the right to discuss their children's well-being with them directly. The girlfriend might see it as an intrusion or criticism, but the parent's primary responsibility is to the child's emotional state. The author's actions were aimed at ensuring his son is comfortable, which is a valid concern. \n\nStill, the girlfriend's feelings of being undermined are significant. The author's approach might have been better if he had communicated with the girlfriend beforehand, but given that the conversation was about the child's feelings rather than a direct criticism, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. It's a delicate balance between a parent's duty to their child and respecting a partner's feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong), because his intention was to check on his son's well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable but doesn't make the author wrong for talking to his child.\n"
