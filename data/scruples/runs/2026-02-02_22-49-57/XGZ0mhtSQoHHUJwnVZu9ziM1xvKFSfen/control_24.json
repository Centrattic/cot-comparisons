My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a father living with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend lost her job and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to her being upset. Then, the author decided to talk to his oldest son (14) about how he feels about his mom being away and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and was really upset, feeling undermined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's right to talk to their child about family matters. As a parent, they have a responsibility to understand their kids' feelings, especially when there are changes like a new caregiver. The author mentions that he did this to check if the kids felt okay, which seems reasonable. The conversation was also about the mother's trip, so it's not just about the girlfriend.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She felt betrayed and that the author doesn't have confidence in her. The key here is whether the author's action was a breach of trust. Did he have a reason to talk to the child without discussing it with her first? The author argues that he needed to talk to his kids without clearing it with the girlfriend. But in a relationship, especially when co-parenting or being a step-parent, communication is important. Maybe the author should have considered talking to the girlfriend first about the intention to discuss things with the kid, especially since the girlfriend is involved in the kids' daily care.\n\nBut then again, the kids' well-being is paramount. The author was concerned about the kids' perception of the new living arrangements. If there's a concern that the kids might sense the girlfriend isn't fully engaged, checking in with them is a responsible act. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about feeling disrespected rather than the actual action of talking to the kid.\n\nAnother angle: The author's decision might be seen as necessary for the kids' emotional health. However, the way it was done without discussing it with the girlfriend could have been handled better. Maybe the author could have approached the girlfriend first, explained the reason for talking to the child, and sought her input. That might have prevented the conflict. But the author's argument is that they need to be able to talk to their kids independently, especially about their own family dynamics.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the action was solely for the child's benefit and the author believed it was necessary, then maybe not. However, if the action was done in a way that disregarded the girlfriend's feelings and role, it could be seen as undermining her. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but the author might have a point in needing to communicate with his children without prior approval.\n\nI think the answer hinges on balancing the parent's duty to their children with respecting their partner's feelings. Since the author's intent was to ensure the kids were okay, and the conversation was part of regular parenting, he might not be in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is more about feeling disrespected, but the author's action was a legitimate parenting move. Therefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
