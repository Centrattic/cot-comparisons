My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 44-year-old man living with his girlfriend (32F) and his two sons, aged 8 and 14. His girlfriend recently lost her job, and he's been supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, but she called him an asshole. Then, the author decided to talk to his oldest son (14) about how he perceives the current situation\u2014his mother being away, living with the girlfriend full-time, and his feelings towards the girlfriend. The author didn't think this was an issue, but the girlfriend found out and got really upset, thinking he undermined her. She left the house, saying she needs to rethink the relationship, called him childish, and accused him of betrayal.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he needs to be able to talk to his kids without clearing it with his girlfriend first. He didn't intend to undermine her; the conversation was as much about the kids' mother being away as about the girlfriend. He's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nHmm. First, I should consider the dynamics of co-parenting and relationships. The author has two children, and he's now in a new relationship with the girlfriend. The kids' well-being is a priority. The author had a conversation with his son about how he feels about the girlfriend and the living situation. The girlfriend is upset because she feels he didn't have confidence in her and that he betrayed her by talking to the son about her.\n\nIn many cases, when a parent is in a new relationship, especially with a live-in partner, it's important to consider how the children feel about the new person in their lives. The author's intention was to check in with his son, which is a responsible approach. However, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the child without her knowledge or consent could affect the child's perception of her. It could be seen as forming a negative opinion or implying she isn't trustworthy, which might not be the case.\n\nBut wait, the author says he did not go to the son to undermine the girlfriend. He mentions the conversation was about both the mother's trip and the girlfriend. So maybe the son has positive feelings, but the girlfriend's reaction is more about feeling untrusted. In relationships, especially with step-parents or co-parents, communication is key. If the author didn't inform the girlfriend beforehand, even if it was a parental duty, it might have come across as not respecting her role as a parental figure to the children. The girlfriend might feel that the children should discuss her with her directly, not with the father. \n\nHowever, the father has a responsibility to talk to his children about their living arrangements and how they feel. It's part of being a parent to ensure the kids are adjusting well. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but maybe there's context from the previous post (which I can't see) that explains her sensitivity. If the author had a good reason to talk to his son and the son was okay with the situation, then the author might be in the right. But the way the author approached it without considering the girlfriend's perspective could be an issue. \n\nIn some cases, discussing the girlfriend with the children in her presence might be appropriate, but the author had a one-on-one conversation. The key points are: the author's intent was to check on the kids' well-being, which is valid. The girlfriend's reaction is based on feeling doubted or disrespected. But the father has a right to talk to his children about their family dynamics. It's a bit of a balancing act between parental responsibility and respecting the partner's feelings. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he had a legitimate reason to talk to his son about the family situation. However, the way he did it might have been insensitive. Maybe he should have discussed it with the girlfriend first, but he's not obligated to do so. The girlfriend's overreaction might be more of the problem here. So the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
