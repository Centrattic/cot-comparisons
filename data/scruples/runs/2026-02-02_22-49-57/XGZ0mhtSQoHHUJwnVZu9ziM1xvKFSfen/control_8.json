My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author lives with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to conflict. Now, he sat down with his oldest son to discuss how the son feels about the situation, including his perception of the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and that the author has no confidence in her.\n\nThe key points here are the parent's responsibility to his children's well-being, the right to communicate with them about family dynamics, and the girlfriend's reaction. Parents generally need to be able to talk to their children about various aspects of their lives, including relationships, to ensure the children are adjusting well. However, the author might not have considered his girlfriend's feelings when discussing her in front of the child. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, as a parent, he has a duty to check in with his children about their emotions and relationships, especially since the previous comments on his post suggested that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of willingness. By having the conversation, he's addressing that concern. However, maybe he should have approached it differently, perhaps discussing with his girlfriend first or being more careful about how the conversation is framed. But the main issue is whether talking to his son is inherently wrong. \n\nSince the son is his child, the parent needs the right to discuss all aspects of the child's life, including relationships with caregivers. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that her role in the family is being questioned. But unless the parent is specifically trying to undermine her in front of the child, which the author claims he isn't, he's not in the wrong. The author's intention was to ensure the child's well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
