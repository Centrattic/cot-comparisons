My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person in the \"Am I the Asshole\" post) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a father living with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week. She was upset and called him an asshole. Now, after considering the comments from Reddit, he talked to his oldest son (14 years old) about his feelings regarding the mother being away, the living arrangement, and his perception of the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, saying he undermined her and lacks confidence in her. \n\nSo, the key points are: the father wants to know how his son feels about the new living situation and his girlfriend. The girlfriend is taking it as a personal attack. The father is arguing that he needed to talk to his children without needing to clear it with her first. \n\nI need to determine if the father's action was wrong. From a parenting perspective, it's important for parents to understand their children's feelings and adjust accordingly. Especially with a step-parent figure, the child's perception might be crucial. The father's intention was to check in with his son, not to criticize the girlfriend. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in her presence or not discussing it with her first could be a problem. But in this case, the father was talking to his son privately. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be about feeling undermined, but the father's right to discuss his children's well-being with them is a valid concern. \n\nThe son was happy with the arrangement, so the father wasn't acting on negative feedback. The girlfriend's overreaction might stem from insecurity or feeling that her role as a step-parent is being questioned. \n\nSince the father's primary responsibility is to his children, and he had a legitimate reason to talk to them about their feelings, it's likely he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, and the father's action was a reasonable parental check-in. So the answer should be B.\n"
