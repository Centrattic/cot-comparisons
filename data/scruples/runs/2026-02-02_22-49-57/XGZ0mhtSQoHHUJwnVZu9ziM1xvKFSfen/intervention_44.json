My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a father living with his girlfriend and two sons, had a conversation with his oldest son about how the kid perceives his mom (who's away) and his girlfriend. The girlfriend got really upset, felt undermined, and left to stay with a friend. The author is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents need to check in with their kids about family dynamics, especially when there are changes, like the mom being away and a new partner involved. The author was concerned about the kids' well-being, which is a valid reason to talk to them. The comments from Reddit users actually pointed this out in the previous post, so he was probably just following through on that advice.\n\nThen there's the girlfriend's reaction. She felt that the father didn't have confidence in her. But the father's intention was to ensure the kids' feelings were okay, not to criticize her. The conversation was also about his ex-wife's situation, not just the girlfriend. So, maybe the girlfriend overreacted. However, it's true that discussing a partner's role with the kids could make them feel insecure or lead to the partner feeling criticized. But the father is the parent; his job is to be the mediator and make sure everyone's okay.\n\nAnother angle: the father is an adult with kids, and he's managing a new relationship. He's trying to balance his responsibilities as a parent with his new partner's feelings. The girlfriend might have expected more communication with her before talking to the kids, but the father didn't have to clear every conversation with her, especially if the kids are his responsibility. However, maybe he could have discussed the conversation with the girlfriend beforehand to avoid misunderstandings. But the main point is that the father's action was in the kids' best interest, not to undermine her.\n\nThe girlfriend's dramatic reaction\u2014leaving the house, saying he's like a 6-year-old\u2014seems excessive. The father is trying to be a responsible parent, and the girlfriend is being defensive. So, in this case, the father's actions were appropriate, and the girlfriend is overreacting. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
