Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy asking the author about her weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then retaliated by asking about his penis size, which led to her being called an overreacting bitch by his friends.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy asked about her weight, which is a sensitive topic for her. She felt it was personal and responded by asking about his insecurities. His friends think she took advantage of his insecurity. The user says the author isn't in the wrong, but I should check if that's the case.\n\nSo, weight can be a personal subject, and it's common for people to feel uncomfortable when asked. The guy's comment about her weight being \"ok\" but not morbidly fat sounds dismissive and possibly hurtful. His defense about double standards is problematic because he's using his own insecurities to justify making her feel bad. \n\nThe author's response was to ask about his penis size, which is also a private topic. However, she did stop when he asked her to, showing she wasn't intent on being cruel. Her aim was to make him understand her perspective. \n\nHis friends' reaction labels her as the asshole, but their reasoning seems to be that she knew about his insecurity and used it. But the guy initiated the personal question, so the author's retaliation was a response to his actions. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, initiating a personal question that makes someone uncomfortable is the first misstep. The author's response, while using his vulnerability, was a form of self-defense in the conversation. She didn't continue after he asked her to stop. \n\nSo, the guy's actions were more at fault for starting the sensitive topic. The author's actions were a reaction to being made uncomfortable, trying to explain her feelings. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
