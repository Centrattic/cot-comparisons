Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves a guy asking about the author's weight, which makes her uncomfortable. She then responds by asking about his dick size, leading to some backlash from his friends.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics of the interaction. The guy asked a personal question about weight, which the author found uncomfortable. She tried to handle it by answering, but his follow-up comment made her feel targeted. She then challenged him by asking about his insecurities, which he found embarrassing. His friends are now criticizing her for overreacting and exploiting his insecurity.\n\nFrom a social norms perspective, asking someone's weight can be seen as intrusive and sensitive. While he might have considered it a casual question, it's often a point of contention because weight is tied to body image issues. The author's response of asking about his dick size was likely meant to highlight the double standard she perceived\u2014men can comment on women's weight, but women can't bring up men's insecurities about size. \n\nHowever, using his insecurity as a response might be seen as using a personal jab, which could be counterproductive. The key here is whether the author had the right to push back in that way. She felt disrespected by his question and his justification that it was just a question. Her retort was an attempt to show the double standard, but it's possible that her method was not the most appropriate. \n\nThe friends' reactions suggest they see her as the aggressor because she used his insecurity. But from another angle, the initial question was the problem. The author's discomfort was valid, and her attempt to point out the double standard, while perhaps not the best approach, stems from a place of being hurt by his comments. \n\nThe question is whether her action of asking about his dick size made her the asshole. Some might argue that she crossed a line, but others might see it as a justified response to his earlier intrusive behavior. The fact that he didn't apologize and continued to defend himself shows that he didn't fully acknowledge her discomfort. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the initial wrongdoing was his for asking a personal question in a way that made her feel targeted. The author's response, while perhaps not the most tactful, was an attempt to address the double standard. The friends' judgment of her as the asshole seems biased, possibly because they're more aligned with his perspective. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. The main issue is the guy's inappropriate question and his failure to empathize with her feelings. Her reaction, while confrontational, was a direct response to his behavior, which was the root problem. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
