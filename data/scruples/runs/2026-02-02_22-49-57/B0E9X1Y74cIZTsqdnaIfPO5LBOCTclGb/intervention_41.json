Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking about the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable, and then she responded by asking about his dick size to highlight the double standard he mentioned.\n\nFirst, the guy asked about her weight after she mentioned not being able to deadlift as much as the woman in the post. The author felt it was a personal question and didn't like it, leading her to confront him. He then made a comment about her weight compared to his, which she took as an insult. She pushed back by asking about his dick size, using his own insecurity against him. He got embarrassed, she stopped, but he didn't apologize. His friends later called her an asshole for exploiting his insecurity, even though he had initiated the sensitive topic.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics. The guy brought up a personal topic (weight), which the author found uncomfortable. She responded by addressing his comment and then used a reciprocal question about his insecurity to make him see her point. The friends criticized her for using his vulnerability, but he had first breached the personal boundary. \n\nIn terms of social norms, asking about someone's weight can be seen as intrusive, even if the intent is curiosity. The author had the right to feel uncomfortable and express that. However, her response of asking about his dick size could be seen as escalating the situation or using his vulnerability to make a point. While it's a form of reciprocal humor, it might not be the most effective or respectful way to address the issue. \n\nBut the key here is mutual respect and boundaries. The guy's question was personal and made her uncomfortable, so she was within her rights to respond. However, using his own insecurity in a direct and potentially embarrassing way might be crossing a line, even if her intention was to highlight the double standard. The friends' reaction suggests they found her approach too harsh, and while it's their opinion, it's possible they see it as an unfair power move. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as defending herself against a personal question, but the method could be questionable. The guy's comments were dismissive of her feelings, so her response was a way to reciprocate the discomfort. However, whether that makes her the asshole is debatable. She was responding to a situation where she felt her boundaries were crossed, but the way she did it might not be the best approach. \n\nSo, the author isn't entirely in the wrong for standing up for herself, but the method she used could be considered a bit much. The guy did ask a personal question, but her response might have been over the top. The friends' judgment is harsh, but there's a point to be made about how she used his vulnerability. It's a tricky balance between mutual respect and not overreacting. The answer might be that she's not in the wrong because he initiated the sensitive topic, but her approach could have been more constructive. However, the friends' perspective is that she took advantage of his insecurity, which adds another layer. \n\nGiven that the guy didn't apologize and the friends are quick to label her as the asshole, it's possible they don't see the initial discomfort she felt. But the author's right to feel uncomfortable and respond, even if not perfectly, should be considered. So leaning towards B (Not in the wrong), but acknowledging that her method could be better. The core issue is the guy's inappropriate question, and the author's response was a reaction to that. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
