Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for responding to a guy's question about her weight by asking about his dick size. The guy asked about her weight after discussing a fitness post, which made her uncomfortable. She answered but then felt he was being rude by comparing their weights and making a comment about her not being morbidly fat. She confronted him, he defended himself, and then she asked about his dick size, which embarrassed him. His friends called her the asshole because she knew his insecurity but used it to make him uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the guy's initial question about her weight is problematic. Weight is a sensitive topic, and while asking directly might be considered rude, the context matters. They were on a date, and he brought it up after a fitness post. But when she answered and he followed up with a comment about her weighing more than him, that could come off as dismissive or even rude. His justification about a \"double standard\" is a bit confusing; he's using his own insecurities to rationalize asking a personal question that he perceives as fair, but the way he phrased it might have crossed a line.\n\nThe author then uses his known insecurity about his dick size to mirror his behavior. This could be seen as teaching him a lesson by showing how personal questions make the other person feel. But does this make her in the wrong? It's a bit of a back-and-forth. The guy initiated the personal question, and she responded in kind. However, the way she handled it might have been confrontational. Instead of addressing the discomfort directly, she turned it around with a question that's even more personal. Some might argue that she should have set boundaries without reciprocating, while others might see it as a justified response to his insensitivity.\n\nThe friends' reaction is also a factor. They're defending him by saying she took advantage of his insecurity. But their logic is flawed because they're applying different standards. If they consider his question about weight acceptable despite knowing it's sensitive, then their criticism of her question about his penis size is hypocritical. However, there's a societal difference in how body-related questions are perceived between men and women, which might influence their judgment.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the guy's question about weight was inappropriate, especially if it made her uncomfortable. His defensive response and the subsequent rant about double standards don't help. The author's reaction, while perhaps a bit direct, is a form of self-defense in the conversation. She's trying to make him understand the impact of his words by putting him in a similar position. The key is that he initiated the personal question, and she responded with another. The friends are likely projecting their own biases. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
