Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The main points are about mutual questions leading to discomfort and a friend group's reactions.\n\nFirst, the guy asked about the author's weight. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and while it's a question, it's often seen as personal. The author felt uncomfortable but answered, then the guy made a comment about her weighing more than him, which came off as judgmental. The author then asked about his penis size in response, which he found embarrassing. The friend group sides with him, saying she overreacted by leveraging his insecurity.\n\nThe key issues here are consent to personal questions and mutual respect. The guy initiated the sensitive topic, which the author found offensive. By asking about his penis size, she was trying to mirror the discomfort he caused. However, using someone's insecurity in a retaliatory way can be seen as using their vulnerability against them, even if it's to make a point. The friend group's reaction suggests they believe this is a double standard because the guy's question was \"just a question,\" while hers is taking advantage of his insecurity.\n\nBut context matters. The guy's question about weight was followed by a judgmental comment. The author's response was a direct challenge to show the imbalance in how personal questions are handled. While it's not appropriate to use someone's insecurities in a confrontational way, the initial question came from him. However, the author's method might be seen as crossing a line, even if her intention was to highlight hypocrisy.\n\nThe friend group's labeling her as the \"asshole\" might stem from societal norms that view physical attributes differently. Weight and body size are often discussed more openly in a critical way towards women, while penis size is a more taboo topic for men. The author's action might be seen as flipping the script, but the friend group's perspective is that she used his insecurity in a way he didn't anticipate, thus making her the asshole.\n\nConsidering both sides, the author's response was a form of retaliation but based on the guy's initial transgression. However, using personal insecurities in this manner can be seen as inappropriate, even if the motive is to show inconsistency. The answer is nuanced. The guy asked a question that made her uncomfortable and then made a judgmental remark. She responded by asking a question she knew would make him uncomfortable, which might not be justified as a response. Therefore, the author could be seen as in the wrong because she escalated the situation in a way that's not constructive. But some might argue she was just using his actions against him to make a point. However, given the friend group's reaction and the potential for using his insecurity in a hurtful way, the answer leans towards her being in the wrong.\n"
