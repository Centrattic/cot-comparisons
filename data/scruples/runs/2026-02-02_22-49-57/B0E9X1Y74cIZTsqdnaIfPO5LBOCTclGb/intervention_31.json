Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the guy asked the author how much she weighs after showing her a fitness post. The author was uncomfortable and answered, but then the guy made a comment about her weighing more than him. The author then asked about his penis size, which he found embarrassing. Now, the friends are saying she's an asshole for using his insecurity against him.\n\nSo, the key points here. The guy brought up a personal topic (weight), which made the author uncomfortable. She answered, and then he made a comparative statement. She then asked a personal question about his penis size in response. The friends are saying she took advantage of his known insecurity. \n\nI need to consider the social norms here. Asking someone's weight can be sensitive, especially for women. The guy's follow-up comment about her weighing more than him might have been inappropriate. The author's response was to ask a question that the guy is known to be insecure about. This could be seen as using his own insecurities against him, which might be a form of tit-for-tat. However, the guy initiated the personal question, so maybe the author was just responding in kind. \n\nBut is it okay to ask a personal question in return? Some people might see that as fair when the other person is making them uncomfortable, while others might think it's not the right approach. The guy's initial question was already making her uncomfortable, and his comment added to that. Her asking about his penis size might escalate the situation, but if she was trying to make him feel the same discomfort, is that justified? \n\nThe friends' reaction is based on the idea that she knew his insecurity and used it, which might be a point against her. But the guy's own actions started the exchange. The author was trying to make him see her perspective by mirroring his behavior. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The guy definitely crossed a line by asking about her weight and making a comparison. The author's response might have been a way to stand up for herself, but some might argue that she shouldn't have asked the question in return. However, since he brought up a sensitive topic first, and she was trying to highlight the double standard he was decrying, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong. \n\nI think the author's actions were a reaction to being made uncomfortable. The guy's initial question was personal, and his comment was harsh. Her asking the question back was a way to make him understand the discomfort he caused. So maybe she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
