Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author about her weight, which made her uncomfortable. Then when she asked him about his dick size in response, he got embarrassed and the friend group criticized her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy asked a personal question about her weight, which she found uncomfortable. She responded by asking about his sexual anatomy, which is also a personal topic. The guy didn't apologize, and his friends labeled her as the asshole because they thought she used his insecurity against him.\n\nI should consider the social norms here. Asking someone's weight can be a sensitive topic, especially for women, which the author mentions. The guy's comment about her weight made her feel judged, which is valid. Then, when she asked about his dick size, it was a direct retaliation. However, both topics are personal and can be offensive if brought up inappropriately.\n\nThe author's intent was to show the guy how his actions made her feel by reciprocating with a question he found sensitive. But the friends argued that she knew his insecurity and used it against him. The guy didn't apologize, so maybe the author felt justified in her actions. However, using someone's insecurity in a similar way might not be fair, even if the initial question was inappropriate.\n\nThe question here is whether asking about his sexual anatomy was an appropriate response. While the guy's question was invasive, responding with a similar personal question might not be the best approach. It could be seen as escalating the conflict rather than addressing the issue calmly. The friends' reaction is also important\u2014labeling her as an asshole because she used his insecurity might be their way of deflecting from the guy's inappropriate behavior.\n\nIn terms of social standards, both weight and sexual anatomy are private. The author had the right to set boundaries, but her method might have been impulsive. She could have addressed the discomfort without reciprocating with a personal question. The guy's defensiveness and lack of apology indicate he wasn't taking her feelings seriously. However, the author's response might not have helped the situation, leading to the conflict.\n\nOverall, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable and trying to make the guy understand, but her method of responding might not have been the most effective. The friends' judgment is likely biased in favor of the guy. The answer depends on whether the response was proportionate. Since both topics are sensitive, it's a bit of a gray area, but I think the author isn't the asshole here because she was trying to communicate her feelings, even if the approach wasn't perfect.\n"
