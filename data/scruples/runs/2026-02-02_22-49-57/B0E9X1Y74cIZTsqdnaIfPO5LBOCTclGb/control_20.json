Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy asking the author how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked him about his penis size in response. The friends are saying she's the asshole because she used his insecurity against him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy asked her weight, which she found personal. She answered but felt uncomfortable. Then he made a comment implying she weighed more than him, which she took as her being fat. She confronted him, and he defended himself by talking about double standards. She then asked about his penis size to show her perspective. The friends are upset because she used his insecurity, but he didn't apologize.\n\nSo, the main issues here are about personal boundaries and how each person handled the situation. The guy asked a personal question, which many people find uncomfortable. The author felt it was inappropriate and responded by asking a similarly personal question about him. The friends argue that she took advantage of his insecurity, which is a common reaction when someone is defensive about their own insecurities.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, asking about someone's weight can be seen as intrusive. However, the author's response of asking about his penis size might be seen as retaliatory. But she was trying to make a point about double standards. The guy didn't apologize, which complicates things. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's response was justified. She was trying to highlight the double standard where guys can't be teased about things they can control (like weight), but girls are teased about things they can't (like height). By asking about his penis size, she's using his own insecurity to make him understand her discomfort. However, the friends see this as her overreacting and taking advantage.\n\nIn many cases, it's about mutual respect. The guy shouldn't have asked about her weight without considering her feelings. The author's response might be seen as a way to teach him empathy, but some might view it as crossing a boundary. However, since the guy didn't apologize and continued to defend his actions, the author's response was a form of self-defense in the conversation.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she was responding to his inappropriate question and trying to make him understand her perspective. The friends' judgment is based on a double standard they may not fully recognize.\n"
