Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nSo, the guy asked how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She responded, and then he made a comment about her weighing more than him. She felt he was implying she was fat, so she confronted him. He defended his question and made a rant about double standards, comparing weight to insecurities guys have about their body. Then she asked him about his dick size to mirror his insecurity, which embarrassed him. His friends are now calling her the asshole because she used his insecurity against him, even though he used hers.\n\nFirst, weight is a sensitive topic. Asking someone's weight can be intrusive and is often seen as personal. The guy's follow-up comment about her weighing more than him sounds like a backhanded compliment, which she took as an insult. She had a right to feel uncomfortable and to push back. Her response was to ask about his dick size, which is also a personal question. But she did it to show him the perspective of being asked something insecure. However, his friends are arguing that she took advantage of his known insecurity.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. When someone asks a personal question, the other person isn't obligated to answer, especially if it makes them uncomfortable. The guy's initial question was inappropriate and judgmental. Her response, while confrontational, was in self-defense to highlight the double standard he was pointing out. However, publicly shaming someone, even in a private conversation, can be crossing a line. But considering the context, she was trying to make a point about mutual respect and the double standards in how personal topics are handled.\n\nHis friends are wrong to call her the asshole because they're dismissing her valid discomfort and shifting blame. The guy's behavior started the issue by making her uncomfortable and then being dismissive of her feelings. Her asking the question was a way to show the hypocrisy in his argument, which is a valid response. So, she's not in the wrong for defending herself. Answer B.\n"
