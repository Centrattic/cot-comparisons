Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking the guy about his dick size after he asked about her weight. First, I need to consider the context. The guy asked her weight, which she found uncomfortable. He then made a comment that she felt was dismissive and harsh. She responded by asking about his dick size, which he found embarrassing. Her friends are calling her an asshole for using his insecurity against him.\n\nSo, the main points are: the guy asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable, he dismissed her feelings, and she retaliated by bringing up his insecurity. The key here is about boundaries and respect. The guy's initial question about her weight was intrusive, and his comments were insensitive. By asking about his dick size, she was trying to show the double standard he was pointing out. But her friends think she overreacted because she used his known insecurity against him.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she was trying to highlight the double standard he was talking about. If he was okay with being teased about his insecurities, then her response was a valid point. However, some might argue that bringing up his insecurity in a confrontational way was also crossing a line. But considering he started by making her uncomfortable and was dismissive, her response could be seen as a way to assert her boundaries. The friends' reactions might be more about protecting their friend's ego rather than the actual issue. So, I think she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
