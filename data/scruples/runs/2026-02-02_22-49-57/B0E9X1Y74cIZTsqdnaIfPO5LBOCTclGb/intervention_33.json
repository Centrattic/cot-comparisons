Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable, and then she responds by asking about his penis size. The guy defends his question and accuses her of being overly sensitive. His friends then call her an overreacting bitch.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were inappropriate. The guy asked a personal question about her weight, which she found uncomfortable. She tried to handle it by answering, but then he made a comment implying she was heavier than him, which she took as an insult. She confronts him, and he justifies it by talking about a double standard regarding body image. She then uses his insecurity about his penis size to mirror his behavior, which made him embarrassed. His friends are against her, saying she used his insecurity.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Is asking about someone's weight appropriate? The guy's question could be seen as intrusive. Weight is a sensitive topic for many, and even if it's a straightforward question, it can come off as rude or objectifying. The author felt uncomfortable and had the right to express that. Her response was to ask a reciprocal question about his penis size. That's a classic \"you do that too\" retort. \n\nNow, is her response justified? If someone makes you uncomfortable by asking a personal question, it's reasonable to point out the inconsistency if they themselves are being judgmental. However, asking about genital size is also a personal and potentially embarrassing question. However, in the context of the guy bringing up his own insecurities through his comments, the author's question might be a way to show the hypocrisy.\n\nThe guy's friends are criticizing her for being sensitive and using his insecurity. But the initial problem started with his question. The author had the right to set boundaries when her comfort was violated. His response of not apologizing and making excuses about double standards shows he was dismissive of her feelings. Her action of reciprocating the question was a way to highlight the double standard he was pointing out. \n\nIn terms of social norms, both asking about weight and genital size are generally considered personal and not appropriate to ask strangers or acquaintances. However, in this case, the guy initiated the personal question, which the author found offensive. Her response was a form of calling out his behavior. While it might be seen as using his insecurity, it was in response to his initial intrusion.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author wasn't in the wrong for setting a boundary and responding in kind. The guy's actions started the conflict, and his friends' judgment seems unfair. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
