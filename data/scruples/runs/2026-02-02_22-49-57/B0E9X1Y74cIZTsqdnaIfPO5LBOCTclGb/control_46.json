Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a guy asked her how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She responded by asking about his dick size, and he got embarrassed and didn't apologize. Then his friends called her an asshole for using his insecurity. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy asked her weight after talking about a female weightlifter. Weight is a sensitive topic for many people, especially women. She felt it was personal and uncomfortable. Her response was to ask about his dick size, which is also a personal and potentially sensitive topic. The guy didn't respond and didn't apologize, but his friends are saying she overreacted.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and reciprocity. He asked her a personal question, which she didn't feel comfortable with. Her response was to ask him a question about his own personal insecurity. It seems like she was trying to mirror his behavior to show him how his question might have made her feel. Is that fair? Well, if someone does something that makes you uncomfortable, responding with a similar question might be seen as a form of passive aggression or a way to highlight the issue. But is there a line crossed here?\n\nIn terms of social norms, both weight and dick size are personal topics. However, the guy's initial question about her weight was perhaps more intrusive, especially since weight can be a common source of insecurity and body shaming. His comment that she weighs more than him and then his rant about double standards might have been triggering her. \n\nWhen she asked about his dick size, he didn't want to answer, which is understandable. The friends' reaction that she took advantage of his insecurity by bringing up the topic he's self-conscious about. But wasn't he the one who started by asking her a personal question? She might have been using his own behavior to point out the double standard he's mentioning. \n\nBut the problem is, maybe she shouldn't have used a potentially offensive question as a response. However, she was trying to make a point. His friends are accusing her of being the asshole, but their argument is that since he didn't know about her weight insecurity, it's okay, but she knew about his. But that's a bit of a \"they didn't know\" defense, which can be problematic because people should be aware that some topics are sensitive without needing prior knowledge.\n\nSo, the guy asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable, and she responded with another personal question to mirror his behavior. The friends are using the fact that she knew about his insecurity to blame her. But in reality, both sides have issues. The guy shouldn't have asked about her weight, and she had the right to express her discomfort. Her follow-up question was a way to show him the impact of his words. \n\nTherefore, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she was defending herself against a personal question that made her feel uncomfortable. The friends' double standard is invalid because both topics are sensitive. The answer would be B (No).\n"
