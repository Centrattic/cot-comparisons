Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy asking how much she weighs, and then she asks about his dick size in response. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy asked her weight after they were on a date and doing small talk. She found the question uncomfortable but answered it. Then he made a comment about her weighing more than him, which she perceived as implying she was fat. She challenged him, and he said she shouldn't be so sensitive. He then ranted about a double standard regarding insecurities about height versus weight.\n\nShe responded by asking about his dick size, referencing his known insecurity. He got embarrassed, asked her to stop, and she did but wanted to make him see her perspective. However, her friends think she was in the wrong because she knew his insecurity and used it, even though he didn't know hers. \n\nSo, the question is whether she's at fault. Let's consider social norms. Asking someone's weight is generally considered personal and can be sensitive. The guy's comment about him being less than her (in weight) did come off as judgmental, which is why she was upset. Her retort was to ask about his dick size, which is also a very personal and sensitive topic. While she had a reason based on his comment and his known insecurity, the act of mocking with a personal question might be seen as retaliatory. \n\nBut the guy initiated by asking her weight, which she felt was invasive. She tried to explain her discomfort, and when he didn't apologize, she used his own insecurity to make a point. The friends are upset because they think she's using his insecurity to justify her action, even if he was insensitive. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the guy's initial question and comment were likely the main issue. However, her response of asking about his dick size in a public or semi-public setting (browsing social media) could be seen as inappropriate, even if it was a reaction to his comment. The key is whether her response was a fair retaliation or crossing a line. \n\nSome might argue that she overreacted by bringing up his insecurity, but others would say it's a valid way to show that personal topics shouldn't be used to judge each other. Since the guy was the one who started the conversation with a sensitive question, maybe she was just mirroring his behavior. However, the content of her question is inherently more offensive and confrontational. \n\nThe friends' reaction suggests they don't see the parallel, which might indicate a double standard. The author's intent was to highlight the guy's insensitivity by using his own insecurities. But regardless of intent, the action of asking about his dick size could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially after he asked her to stop. \n\nSo, while the guy was wrong first, the author's response might still be considered inappropriate. Therefore, she could be in the wrong, but maybe not entirely. The answer depends on whether the retaliation was proportional. Since the users are to answer A or B, and the community often looks at intent and context in AITA situations, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the guy's actions were the root cause and her response was a way to make him understand her feelings. However, the method of retaliation might be questionable, but the underlying issue is the guy's insensitivity.\n"
