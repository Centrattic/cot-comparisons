Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. So, first, I need to go through the situation they described carefully.\n\nThe main points are: The guy asked how much she weighs during a date, which made her uncomfortable. She felt he was being rude when he said she weighed more than him. She responded by asking about his dick size, which embarrassed him, and now her friends are saying she's the asshole. The guy argues that she took advantage of his insecurity.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The guy asked her weight, which can be a sensitive topic. She felt uncomfortable but answered, then he made a comment about his weight being less. She got angry and asked about his dick size, which he didn't like. The friends think she overreacted.\n\nIs she wrong? Well, the guy asked a personal question, which she felt was inappropriate. By asking back about his dick size, she's using his insecurity to mirror his behavior. But maybe she overstepped because she's using his personal insecurity to make a point. However, she was responding to his comment that made her uncomfortable. \n\nBut the friends are saying she took advantage because she knew about his insecurity. The guy didn't apologize, and she used that to retaliate. So, perhaps she's in the wrong because she's using his insecurity to hurt his feelings, similar to how he hurt hers. However, her initial reaction to his question was valid\u2014weight is a sensitive topic. \n\nBut the act of asking about his dick size might be seen as crossing a line, even if it's to make a point. Maybe she should have addressed the issue without reciprocating with another personal question. The guy's question was inappropriate, but her response might not be the best way to handle it. So, the friends might be right in labeling her as the asshole because she took the personal attack back in a hurtful way. \n\nBut then again, if he made her uncomfortable first, maybe her response was a way to show the double standard. However, using his insecurity against him might not be the healthiest approach. It's a bit of a toss-up between both sides. The AITA subreddit often sides with people who are standing up for themselves, but maybe this is a case where the response was too harsh. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because she used his personal insecurity to retaliate, which could be seen as taking advantage. But others might argue that she was just showing the double standard. Hmm.\n"
