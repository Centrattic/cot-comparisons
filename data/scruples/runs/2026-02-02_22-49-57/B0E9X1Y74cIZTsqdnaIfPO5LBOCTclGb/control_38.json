Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong after a conversation where they responded to a guy's question about their weight with a question about his penis size. \n\nFirst, the guy asked about the author's weight, which made them uncomfortable. The author responded by asking about his penis size, which the guy found embarrassing. His friends then criticized the author for being an \"overreacting bitch\" because they knew his insecurity but he didn't know hers.\n\nI need to consider social norms and mutual respect. Asking about someone's weight can be a sensitive topic and is often seen as personal or intrusive. The author felt uncomfortable and used the guy's known insecurity to mirror his behavior. While that might have been a way to teach a lesson, it's possible that the author overstepped by bringing up a different personal topic.\n\nHowever, the guy initiated the intrusive question, which set the precedent. The author's response could be seen as a form of holding him accountable for making them uncomfortable. But using his insecurity against him might not be fair, even if it's a reciprocal action. The friends' reaction might be based on the idea that the author exploited his vulnerability, even if they didn't know about it. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The guy's question was the initial issue, but the author's response could be seen as retaliating. However, the author was also trying to make him see their perspective. In terms of social norms, both topics are personal, but the context matters. The author's action might be justified as a way to highlight the double standard, but others might see it as using his insecurity against him. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's action was a reaction to being made uncomfortable by the guy's question. But since both topics are sensitive, the author might be seen as equally at fault for reciprocating. However, the guy's initial question was the root problem, and the author's response was a form of self-defense. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but there's a possibility of A if the retaliation is seen as unfair. However, given that the guy started the sensitive question, the author's response might be justified. So leans towards B.\n"
