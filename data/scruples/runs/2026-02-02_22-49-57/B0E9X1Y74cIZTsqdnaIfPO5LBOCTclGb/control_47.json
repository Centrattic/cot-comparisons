Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a guy asked her how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She responded by asking him about his dick size, using his own insecurity against him. Now, the friends are calling her an asshole, and she's asking if she's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy asked about her weight, which is a sensitive topic for her. She felt it was a personal question and that his follow-up comment made her feel judged. She tried to explain her discomfort, but he didn't apologize and instead started talking about double standards. Then she used his known insecurity about his dick size to make a point. \n\nThe key points here are about respect and boundaries. Asking someone's weight can be seen as intrusive, especially if it's not a neutral question. His comment about her weight being \"ok\" but not morbidly fat might have come off as condescending. She was uncomfortable and tried to address it, which is valid. However, when she asked about his dick size, that's a very personal and potentially offensive question, especially in a social context. \n\nEven though she was trying to show him his own inconsiderate behavior, using his insecurity in that way could be seen as crossing a boundary. While she had a right to express her discomfort, responding with a question about a private body part might not be the best approach. People might view this as her taking the conversation too far, even if her intention was to highlight the double standard. \n\nAlso, the friends' reactions are part of the equation. They see her as overreacting because they know his insecurity, but they don't take into account her feelings about her weight. However, the author's actions might have been a way to stand up for herself, but the method could be questioned. \n\nIn terms of social norms, both weight and body size discussions can be sensitive. It's generally considered rude to ask someone about their weight or their genital size. The guy initiated the sensitive topic, but her response might have escalated things in a way that's not socially acceptable. \n\nSo, while the guy was definitely in the wrong for asking a personal question and being dismissive, the author's response of asking about his dick size might be seen as equally disrespectful. Therefore, she might share some responsibility for escalating the situation inappropriately, even if her intention was to make a point. \n"
