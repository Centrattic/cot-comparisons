Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable, and then she retaliated by asking about his dick size. The guy didn't apologize, and her friends are saying she's the asshole because she used his insecurity against him.\n\nFirst, the guy's question about weight is personal and can be sensitive, especially for women. It's not a neutral topic and can lead to discomfort. The author felt uncomfortable, which is valid. When he made a comment about her weighing more than him and then made a judgment, that crossed a line. His response was harsh, even if he didn't mean to hurt her feelings.\n\nThen, when the author asked about his dick size, it's a direct response to his previous personal question. She might have done it to show him the same kind of discomfort he caused. However, asking about someone's genital size is also a personal and sensitive topic. But in this context, she was trying to make a point about the double standard he mentioned\u2014how guys can be judgmental about size, yet he criticized her for being sensitive about weight.\n\nThe friends' reaction is interesting. They think she overreacted because she used his insecurity against him. But his initial comments were the ones that started the conflict. He didn't apologize and instead ranted about double standards, which suggests he was dismissive of her feelings. The author's response was a form of holding him accountable for his behavior, using his own insecurities as a mirror to his comments.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, both parties acted in ways that could be seen as insensitive. The guy asked a personal question and made a judgmental comment. The author retaliated with another personal question. However, the key here is that the guy initiated the problematic behavior first. The author's response was a way to make him see her perspective, which could be a form of self-defense in the conversation. But the friends' criticism is that she took advantage of his insecurity, which is a valid point because she did use his known insecurity to challenge him.\n\nBut considering that he didn't apologize and continued to defend his actions, the author's attempt to highlight the double standard isn't entirely without merit. However, using the same tactics he used might not be the best approach. It's a bit of a gray area. If the question was asked in a confrontational way to shame him, that's one thing, but if it was to make a point, maybe it's justified. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the actions were reasonable given the provocation. The guy's actions were the first part of the problem, and the author's response, while also personal, was a reaction to his initial transgression. The friends are quick to label her as the asshole without considering the context of his behavior. So, while both acted in potentially hurtful ways, the author's actions were a direct response to his insensitivity. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong because he started it and didn't own up to his mistake.\n"
