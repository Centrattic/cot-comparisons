Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by asking the guy about his dick size after he asked her weight.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the situation. The guy asked her weight, which made her uncomfortable. Then he made a comment implying she was heavier than him, and she responded by asking about his dick size. The guy got embarrassed and didn't apologize, and his friends called her an overreacting bitch.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent and mutual respect in personal questions. The guy initiated the sensitive question first. The author felt it was inappropriate and tried to explain her discomfort. Her response was to ask a reciprocal question, which might be seen as using his insecurity against him. However, the guy's initial inquiry was the catalyst. \n\nI should consider if it's fair to reciprocate with a personal question. Maybe the author thought it would help him understand her perspective, but it backfired. The guy's friends blamed her, but maybe they're more focused on his insecurities. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the guy's original question was the starting point. The author had the right to express her discomfort, but using his insecurity might not be the best approach. However, if he's making her uncomfortable and not respecting her boundaries, her response could be justified. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. If the author's intent was to show empathy by asking a question he's uncomfortable with, it's a form of teaching a lesson. But maybe that's not the best way to handle it. The guy's reaction and lack of apology might indicate he wasn't being respectful either. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were a reaction to the guy's initial inappropriate question. She tried to assert her boundaries, which is valid. The friends' reaction seems unfair. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
