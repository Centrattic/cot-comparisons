Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation started with the guy asking her out on a date. At the end of the date, they were making small talk. He showed her a fitness post about a woman's deadlift, and then he asked her how much she weighs. She felt uncomfortable because weight is a sensitive topic for her. She answered, and then he made a comment about her weighing more than him. She got upset, questioned his motives, and he tried to defend himself by saying it's a double standard. She then asked about his dick size to mirror his insecurity, which embarrassed him. The guy's friends later called her an overreacting bitch.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The guy asked a personal question about her weight, which is sensitive. She was uncomfortable but answered, then he followed up with a comment that felt dismissive or even a bit derogatory. She tried to confront him by asking a reciprocal question about his insecurities. The friends are on his side, suggesting it's her fault for using his insecurities against him.\n\nIn terms of social norms, asking about weight is often seen as intrusive and can be hurtful. While weight can be a sensitive topic, especially for women in societies where body image is a big issue, the guy's follow-up comment about her weight being \"ok\" might have come off as condescending. The author's reaction\u2014questioning his motives and then using his own insecurities to mirror his behavior\u2014could be seen as a form of self-defense or trying to teach him a lesson. However, asking about his dick size is a personal and potentially uncomfortable question for him, which might be why his friends are upset with her.\n\nBut the key here is consent and mutual respect. The guy crossed a line by asking a personal question without considering her comfort. She had a right to express her discomfort. Her response, while perhaps a bit confrontational, was in response to his initial intrusion. However, using his insecurity about his body in the same way he used hers might not be the most respectful approach. It's a form of tit-for-tat, which can be seen as equally unkind, even if it's meant to highlight hypocrisy.\n\nThe guy's friends are focusing on the fact that she knew about his insecurity and used it against him, which is why they side with him. But they're ignoring the fact that he initiated the intrusive question. The author's actions were a direct response to his behavior, so maybe she's not at fault. However, the debate is whether her response was appropriate. If the goal was to make him understand her perspective, maybe a different approach would have been better. But given the context, her actions might be justified as a way to call him out on his behavior.\n\nIn summary, the guy started the problematic interaction by asking a personal and sensitive question. The author's reaction was in response to that, and while her method might be questionable, the initial wrong was on his side. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
