Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author's weight during a date, then making a comment that the author found offensive. The author then retaliated by asking about his dick size to show the double standard, which the guy found embarrassing. The friends in the group criticized the author, saying she overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The guy asked a personal question (weight), which the author found uncomfortable. Then he made a comment that came off as judgmental. The author, wanting to highlight the double standard, asked a similarly personal question (dick size), which is a sensitive topic for the guy. The friends think the author is at fault because she used his insecurity against him, knowing his sensitivity.\n\nIn terms of social norms, both weight and dick size are personal topics. The guy initiated the conversation by asking a question the author felt was intrusive. The author's response was to mirror the question back, pointing out the hypocrisy. However, the friends argue that since the author knew his insecurity, she took advantage of it. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the guy's question was inappropriate, and the author had the right to express discomfort. Retaliating with a question about his insecurities might be seen as using his vulnerability, but it's also a way to demonstrate the double standard. The key here is whether the author's response was a justified form of highlighting the issue or an unfair attack. \n\nIn many cases, people might argue that both parties are at fault: the guy for making the initial intrusive comment and the author for responding in kind. However, the friends' reaction seems harsh, as they're defending the guy's actions while dismissing the author's valid discomfort. The author's intent was to point out hypocrisy, which is a common strategy in such situations. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The main issue is the guy's inappropriate question and comment. The author's response, while maybe not the most tactful, was a way to draw attention to the double standard. The friends' judgment seems biased towards the guy's side without fully understanding the context. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
