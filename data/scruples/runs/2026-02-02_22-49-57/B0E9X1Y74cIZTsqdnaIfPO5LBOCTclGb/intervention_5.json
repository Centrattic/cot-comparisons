Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after she asked the guy about his dick size in response to him asking about her weight.\n\nFirst, the guy asked her weight, which she found uncomfortable. He then made a comment that she interpreted as him saying she's fat, even if he didn't mean it that way. She confronted him, and he got defensive, bringing up a double standard about how men can be discriminatory about weight (which is a controllable trait) compared to things like height. Then she used his insecurity about his penis size to mirror his behavior, which embarrassed him. His friends are now calling her a bitch for overreacting.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether her response was justified. The guy asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable, and then he was dismissive of her feelings. By asking about his penis size, she's using his own insecurity against him to show the double standard. But is that fair?\n\nIn general, asking about someone's weight is considered personal and can be sensitive. His comment about her weight might have been off-putting. Her response was to mirror his behavior, which could be seen as a tactic to make him understand her discomfort. However, asking about penis size is also a personal and sensitive topic, and some might argue that she went too far, even if her intention was to highlight the double standard.\n\nBut considering that he brought up his insecurities in a way that was dismissive of her feelings, using that same vulnerability to mirror his actions might be a valid form of showing the hypocrisy. However, others might see it as using his insecurity in a way that's cruel, even if it's to make a point. The friends' reaction supports the idea that they see her as overstepping.\n\nBut the key here is whether the initial question was wrong. Since the guy asked her weight, which is a sensitive topic, and then got defensive, her response was an attempt to make him see the issue. Even though asking about his penis size is also personal, it's a form of showing the double standard he's pointing out. So maybe she's not in the wrong because she was responding to his behavior with the same kind of question. The problem might be that the friends are applying a double standard themselves by calling her a bitch for using his insecurity, even though they do the same teasing.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because she responded to his inappropriate behavior with a mirror strategy, which could be a way to show the inconsistency. However, there's a nuance because both topics are sensitive, but her action was a reaction to his initial transgression.\n"
