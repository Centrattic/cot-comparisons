Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break this down step by step. The guy asked the author how much she weighs, which she found personal and uncomfortable. He then made a comment about her weighing more than him, which she interpreted as implying she's fat. She responded by asking about his dick size, referencing his known insecurity, and he got embarrassed and asked her to stop. Now, the friends are saying she's the asshole because she used his insecurity to make a point.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy's question about her weight is a personal topic that can be sensitive. The author felt uncomfortable and tried to address it by using the guy's own insecurities to mirror his behavior. That seems like a form of tit-for-tat, which is a way to show how personal questions can make someone feel. However, the guy didn't apologize, and his friends are criticizing her for overreacting and using his insecurity.\n\nThe key points here are the dynamics of personal questions and mutual respect. If someone asks a personal question that makes you uncomfortable, responding with another personal question (especially about a sensitive topic like body size) might be seen as using the same tactics. But the author was trying to make a point about the double standard in how personal questions are handled. The guy's comment about her weight and his defense about double standards for height vs. weight is a bit problematic because both are body-related topics, but weight is more within a person's control. However, that doesn't necessarily justify the author's response.\n\nThe friends' reaction is important too. They're saying she took advantage of his known insecurity. The author's intention was to make him see her perspective, but the method might have been inappropriate. While she had the right to express her discomfort, directly asking about his dick size could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if it's a personal topic. It might be more about the approach rather than the intent. So, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, she's standing up for herself, but on the other, using a personal question as retaliation could be seen as matching his behavior. The answer depends on whether the response was justified as a form of communication or if it was a personal attack. Since the guy didn't apologize, maybe the author felt she needed to escalate to make her point. However, the friends' perspective is that she exploited his insecurity. I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because she addressed a valid discomfort, but her method might not have been the best. So, the correct answer might be B, but there's nuance here. The user wants a yes or no, so I have to decide based on the main factors.\n"
