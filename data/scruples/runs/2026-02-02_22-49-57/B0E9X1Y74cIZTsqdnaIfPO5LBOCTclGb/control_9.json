Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking about the author's weight, which made them uncomfortable, leading to a back-and-forth conversation. The author then asked about the guy's dick size to show his own insecurity, which he found embarrassing.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The guy asked about the author's weight, which is a sensitive topic. Even though he might have thought it was a casual question, it's clear that the author felt uncomfortable. The guy's follow-up comment about her weighing more than him and his justification about body standards could come off as dismissive or even hurtful. His defense about \"just a question\" and the double standard might not be valid because he's using another person's insecurity as a reason to ask personal questions, which isn't a fair comparison.\n\nThe author's response was to ask about his dick size, which is also a personal question. However, she did this to mirror his behavior and show him how it feels to be asked something they're insecure about. While this approach might be seen as using his insecurity against him, she did stop when he asked her to. It seems like she was trying to make him understand her perspective without escalating the situation further.\n\nThe friends' reactions also matter. They accused her of being a \"bitch\" and overreacting, but they didn't seem to consider the guy's initial actions. They focused on the fact that she used his insecurity, but overlooked that he started by asking about her weight in an insensitive way.\n\nIn terms of social norms, asking someone's weight can be considered intrusive, especially if it's not relevant. The guy's comment about her weight being \"ok\" and not \"morbidly fat\" might have been an attempt to be kind, but it came off as judgmental. The author's response was a form of confrontation to highlight the double standard, which is a valid approach. However, whether it was the right method is debatable. But overall, she was responding to an uncomfortable situation and trying to set boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The guy started the problematic interaction by asking a sensitive question. The author's response, while using his insecurity, was a way to show him the impact of his actions. The friends are biased in his favor. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
