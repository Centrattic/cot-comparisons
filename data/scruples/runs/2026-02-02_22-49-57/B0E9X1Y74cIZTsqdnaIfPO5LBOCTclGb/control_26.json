Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy asked the author how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. Then he made a comment comparing his weight to hers, which she found offensive. She then asked him about his dick size as a way to show him her perspective, and he didn't respond. The friend group is calling her a bitch for that.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the interactions. The guy started by asking a personal question about her weight. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and the author felt uncomfortable. Then he made a comment about her weight being okay but not morbidly fat, which she found harsh. She confronts him about the question, and he defends himself by talking about double standards, mentioning how guys are insecure about things like height but women are sensitive about weight. \n\nShe then uses his insecurity about his dick size to ask him about it, which he finds embarrassing. The friends are saying she's in the wrong because she knew his insecurity and used it against him, while he didn't know hers. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, asking someone their weight can be intrusive. The guy's question was personal and possibly inappropriate, given how sensitive weight can be. His follow-up comments about her weight being okay but not morbidly fat were dismissive and maybe hurtful. The author's response was to ask about his dick size, which is also a personal question. However, she did this to show him her perspective, which is a form of mirroring his behavior. \n\nBut she did know his insecurity about his size, so she used that to make a point. The friends are arguing that she took advantage of his insecurity, while he didn't know hers. However, the initial question from him was still the starting point. She was trying to make him understand how his actions felt by doing the same. \n\nIn terms of social norms, personal questions like weight and genitals are generally considered private. Both the guy and the author crossed that line. But the key here is intent. The guy asked about her weight without considering her feelings, and then made a comment that could be seen as degrading. The author's response was a direct comparison to make him feel the same discomfort, which is a form of reciprocal action. \n\nHowever, some might argue that using someone's insecurity against them is also wrong, but in this case, the author was reacting to the guy's initial inappropriate behavior. The friends are blaming her because they see it as her taking advantage, but they don't acknowledge the guy's initial inconsiderate question. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author was in a situation where she felt disrespected. Her response was a way to highlight the double standard she experienced. While her method might be seen as harsh, the root issue is the guy's first action. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she was responding to a personal attack with a personal question to make a point. The friends are missing the initial problem. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
