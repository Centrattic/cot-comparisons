Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking the guy about his dick size after he asked her weight.\n\nFirst, the guy asked her weight, which made her uncomfortable. She responded, and he then made a comment about her weight compared to his. She felt he was being harsh and confrontational. Then she asked about his dick size to mirror his insecurity. He didn't apologize, and his friends called her an overreacting bitch.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal boundaries and reciprocity. The guy brought up a sensitive topic (weight), which can be a delicate subject. She responded by bringing up his known insecurity (dick size) to show the double standard. But the friends are criticizing her for using his insecurity against him.\n\nI need to consider if her response was appropriate. Was it fair for her to use his insecurity to highlight his behavior? Or did she cross a boundary by asking about his private body part in response? \n\nOn one hand, she was pointing out the inconsistency in how they treated each other's insecurities. On the other hand, asking about his dick size might be seen as retaliating in a way that's equally personal. However, the guy initiated the conversation by asking her weight, which she found uncomfortable and offensive. Her response was a way to show that the double standard exists.\n\nThe friends argue she knew about his insecurity and used it against him. But maybe she was trying to make him aware of how his actions made her feel. The guy didn't apologize, which complicates things. \n\nIn terms of social norms, asking someone about their weight is often considered more intrusive than asking about their body part like penis size, which is a very personal question. However, the context matters here. He asked her weight, which she found offensive, so she used his known insecurity to mirror his behavior. \n\nHer friends labeled her as the asshole, but that might be because they support the guy and don't see the issue with his initial question. The guy's comment about double standards and height vs. weight might also play a role here. But his argument that men can't help their height but can control weight is a problematic comparison.\n\nSo, weighing all this, the author's action might be seen as a justified attempt to highlight the double standard. However, using his insecurities against him could be seen as crossing a line. But considering the guy's initial question was the trigger, and her response was in response to his harshness, she might not be in the wrong. The friends' judgment seems biased. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
