Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a guy asked the author how much she weighs during a date. The author found it uncomfortable and then he made a comment about her weight being okay but not morbidly fat. Then she asked him how big his dick is in response, which made him embarrassed. His friends later called her an overreacting bitch.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The guy asked a personal question about weight, which the author felt was inappropriate or made her uncomfortable. She answered but then he made a comment that she interpreted as her being fat. She confronted him, and he defended his question by bringing up a double standard argument about discrimination between genders. Then she asked about his dick size to mirror his insecurity, which he found embarrassing. His friends criticized her for it.\n\nNow, considering social norms, asking someone's weight is generally seen as intrusive and can be hurtful. The guy's comment about her weight being okay but not morbidly fat might come off as dismissive or even offensive. The author's reaction seems reasonable given the discomfort caused. By asking about his dick size, she's using his own insecurity against him, which could be seen as a form of retaliation. However, retaliation in this context might be a way to make him understand her feelings. \n\nThe key point is whether the author overstepped by asking about his body when he asked hers. The guy brought up weight, which is a sensitive topic, and the author used his known insecurity to highlight the double standard. His friends' reactions suggest they see her actions as exploiting his insecurity, but the author's intent was to show him how his behavior affected her. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, while both topics are personal, the initial question from the guy was the catalyst. The author's response could be seen as a way to illustrate the double standard he mentioned. However, using a personal question to retaliate might not be the most constructive approach. But considering the context, her actions were a direct response to his behavior, aiming to make him see her perspective. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If the initial question was inappropriate, and her response was a way to highlight the issue, then she's not entirely at fault. The guy started the exchange with a personal question, and she mirrored it to show the imbalance. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
