Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation involves a guy asking the woman about her weight at the end of a date. The woman felt uncomfortable and responded by asking about his dick size as a way to show him how it feels to be asked an intrusive question. Then, when their friends judged the woman as being the asshole, she's questioning if she's wrong.\n\nSo, the main points are: \n\n1. The guy asked a personal question about her weight, which made her uncomfortable. \n2. She responded by asking a similar personal question about his body (dick size) to highlight the double standard.\n3. The friends accused her of being the asshole because she used his insecurity against him, even though she claims he didn't know about her weight insecurities.\n\nI need to determine if her actions were wrong. Let's consider the social norms here. It's generally considered inappropriate to ask someone's weight, as it's a sensitive topic. The guy's question was intrusive. Then, the woman's response was to mirror his behavior, using his own insecurity about his body to make a point. \n\nWhile her intention was to show him the double standard, using his insecurity in the same way he used hers might be seen as unfair, especially since he didn't know about her insecurities. However, her initial discomfort was valid, and she had a right to set a boundary. \n\nBut when she asked about his body size, even if it was to make a point, it's also a personal and potentially hurtful question. Friends might see this as taking advantage of his vulnerability. However, she was trying to make a point about reciprocity in how such questions are asked. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the woman overstepped by using his insecurity as a countermeasure. While the guy's initial question was wrong, the woman's response might be seen as equally inappropriate, hence the friends labeling her as the asshole. But if she was pointing out the hypocrisy, maybe she's justified. However, using a personal attack to make a point can be counterproductive and might be seen as the wrong approach. \n\nIn terms of social norms, both actions are problematic, but the woman's response was an attempt at reciprocity. However, since the guy's question was the initial problem, the blame might not be entirely on her. But by asking the question in return, she mirrored his behavior, which could be seen as wrong. \n\nSo, considering the context, the woman had the right to be upset about the weight question, and her asking about his body size was a way to highlight the double standard. However, friends might interpret her actions as taking advantage of his insecurity. The answer hinges on whether her method of showing the double standard was appropriate. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong) because the initial question was the problem, and her response, while possibly not the best approach, was an attempt to address the double standard. However, others might argue she went too far. But in the context of AITA, the community might see her as not the asshole because she was defending herself against intrusive behavior.\n"
