Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a guy asked how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She responded by asking about his dick size, which he didn't like, and his friends are now calling her the asshole. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the guy asked her weight, which is a personal question and can be sensitive. She felt uncomfortable, which is valid because weight is a common topic that people feel self-conscious about. When she asked him about his dick size, it's a direct retaliation. But is that justified?\n\nHe asked her weight, and she took offense. When she asked him back about his size, he didn't like it and they had a fight. His friends think she's the asshole because she knew he was insecure about that. So, the key points here are: Is it fair to mirror the personal question he asked, even if you're upset? Also, does the fact that he brought up weight first give her a reason to respond in kind?\n\nHe said he was just curious, but his comment about her weight being okay but not morbidly fat was harsh. She felt disrespected. But when she asked him about his size, it's a sensitive topic for him. His friends argue she used his insecurity against him. \n\nI think the main issue is how to handle personal questions that make you uncomfortable. She had the right to feel uncomfortable when he asked her weight, and she's entitled to set boundaries. However, responding with a question about his body that he's insecure about might not be the best approach. It could be seen as using his vulnerability to make a point, which might not be fair. But then again, he initiated the personal question, so maybe she's within her rights to push back.\n\nThe key is whether her response was a proportionate reaction. He asked her weight in a way that made her feel disrespected, and she tried to show him how his question affected her by asking a question about his body, which he also finds sensitive. But maybe she should have addressed his behavior without mirroring it. Instead of asking about his size, she could have explained why the question was hurtful. Using his insecurity might be seen as unfair, even if her intent was to make a point.\n\nHis friends' reaction might be influenced by their own biases and the fact that they tease him about his insecurities. They might not see her perspective because they're more used to him being teased. But that doesn't necessarily mean she's wrong.\n\nIn terms of social norms, asking about someone's weight is generally considered rude, and the guy shouldn't have asked. She had the right to take offense. However, the way she responded by asking a similar personal question might come across as using his insecurities against him, which his friends saw as taking advantage. So, maybe she's not entirely wrong, but her method could have been better. \n\nBut the question is whether she's the asshole. The fact that she stood up for herself and tried to make him understand her perspective is good, but maybe the way she did it (by asking about his size) was not the best approach. So perhaps the answer is B (she's not in the wrong), but there's nuance. Alternatively, some might argue that she should have handled it differently without retaliating with another personal question. \n\nI think the main point is that asking someone's weight is inappropriate, and she's not wrong for being upset. Her response, while maybe not the best method, was an attempt to communicate the hurt. So overall, she's not the asshole.\n"
