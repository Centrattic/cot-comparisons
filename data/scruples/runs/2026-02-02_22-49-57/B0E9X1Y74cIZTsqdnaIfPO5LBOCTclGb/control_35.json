Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a guy and a girl in a friend group where the guy asked the author how much she weighs. She felt uncomfortable and then he made a comment about her weighing more than him, which she took as him implying she's fat. She responded by asking about his dick size, which was a personal question, and he became embarrassed. Now, her friends are saying she's the asshole (AITA) because she used his insecurity against him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the interactions. The initial question: the guy asked about her weight. Weight can be a sensitive topic, so it's valid for her to feel uncomfortable. Then he made a comment that she weighs more than him. That's a bit awkward because comparing weights can come off as judgmental, especially since weight is personal. She then confronts him by asking about his dick size, which is another personal topic. He gets embarrassed and doesn't apologize, and her friends are upset she used his insecurity against him.\n\nSo, to determine if she's in the wrong (A for Yes, B for No). The key points are whether his question was inappropriate, her response, and if her reaction was justified. The guy asked about her weight, which is a personal question, and then made a comparison. She felt that the comment was harsh and responded by turning the question back on him about a different personal topic. Her friends are arguing that she knew about his insecurity and used it against him, which they see as hypocritical.\n\nNow, considering social norms: asking someone's weight is generally considered personal and can be invasive. His comment about her weighing more than him might have been a slip, but it's not a great response. Her reaction could be seen as trying to make him feel the same discomfort he caused her, which is a form of tit-for-tat. However, using his known insecurity was probably a mistake in terms of handling the situation, even if her intention was to show him his insensitivity.\n\nBut is that making her the asshole? Well, she had the right to feel uncomfortable and to set boundaries. However, responding with a question that's even more personal might not be the best approach. It's a bit of a gray area. The guy's initial question was rude, and his comment was unkind, so she's justified in feeling upset. However, her method of responding might not be appropriate, even if it was in self-defense. \n\nThe friends are judging her for using his insecurity against him, which is a form of emotional manipulation or retaliation. But if he was already making her uncomfortable and then defending his comment by bringing up double standards, her pointing out the hypocrisy by mirroring his behavior could be seen as a way to make him understand. However, the act of asking about his dick size is a personal question, so even if it's to make a point, it's still crossing a line.\n\nSo, the question is whether her action of asking the personal question was wrong. On one hand, she was retaliating for being made to feel uncomfortable. On the other, she's asking about a sensitive topic she knows he's insecure about. The friends' reaction is that she's the asshole because she used his insecurity, which is a valid point. But the original question from him was also inappropriate. \n\nThe user is asking if she's in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural or personal perspectives. Some might say she was within her right to push back, others might say it's not appropriate to ask a personal question in response. The guy's behavior was likely the initial problem, but her response might not be entirely justified, leading to her being considered in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because even though the guy's actions were rude, her choice of response might have been equally inappropriate. But I need to be careful here. Maybe the key is that she had the right to tell him the question was personal and not answer, but instead she chose to ask another personal question, which her friends saw as using his insecurity. Therefore, she's in the wrong for using that tactic, even if the guy's actions were also wrong. The \"ITA\" part is about her own actions, not just his. So, she's the one who asked the question, so she's in the wrong.\n"
