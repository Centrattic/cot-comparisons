Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after a situation where a guy asked her weight, and she then asked him about his penis size in response.\n\nFirst, the guy asked her weight, which she found uncomfortable. Weight is a sensitive topic for many, so that's understandable. He then made a comment that she interpreted as her being fat, even if he didn't mean it that way. She confronted him about the question's purpose and he defended himself by bringing up a double standard about men's insecurities versus women's. \n\nShe then asked him about his penis size, which is a personal question too. The friends in the group criticized her for using his insecurity to make a point. The key here is whether her response was justified. \n\nThe guy asked a personal question first, and when she pushed back, he didn't apologize. She used his own insecurity to highlight the double standard he mentioned. While the question she asked is personal, it's a direct response to his initial intrusion. In the context of the conversation, where he brought up a sensitive topic and then criticized her for being sensitive, her action seems to be pointing out the hypocrisy. \n\nThe friends' reaction suggests they see it as an overreaction, but the author's actions were a reaction to his comments. There's no clear line of her being in the wrong here. The guy started the exchange with a personal question and then didn't back down when confronted. Her response, while also personal, was in the context of a mutual exchange of sensitive topics. \n\nSo, considering the dynamics of the conversation and the guy's initial actions, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
