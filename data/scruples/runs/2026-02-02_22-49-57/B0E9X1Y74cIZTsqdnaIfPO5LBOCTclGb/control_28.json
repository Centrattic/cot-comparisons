Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The guy asked how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She answered but then he made a comment about her weight being more than his, which she took as a negative remark. Then she asked him about his dick size as a way to show him her perspective. He didn't respond and she stopped, but his friends called her an overreacting bitch.\n\nFirst, the guy asked a personal question about her weight. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and while it's a common question, it's not always appropriate. She felt uncomfortable, which is valid. Her response was to answer, but then he made a comment that she felt was dismissive and possibly insulting. She confronted him about the question, and he defended himself by talking about double standards. \n\nThen she asked him a personal question about his dick size, which he's known to be insecure about. He became embarrassed and asked her to stop. The friends later blamed her for using his insecurity against him. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The guy asked a personal question first, which put her on the spot. She tried to address her discomfort by confronting him, but he didn't apologize. Her asking about his size was a form of mirroring his behavior, showing him how it felt. However, even though she knew his insecurity, she used it as a way to make a point. The friends see this as her taking advantage, which complicates things. \n\nIs her action justified? She was responding to his previous intrusion into her personal space. However, using his insecurity might be seen as unfair, even if it was to teach a lesson. The key here is whether the author overstepped by asking about his size after he was confrontational. \n\nBut the initial question from him was the root issue. She had a right to feel uncomfortable and to express that. Her response was a way to highlight the double standard he was talking about. However, the friends' reaction suggests that in their group, such personal questions are somewhat normalized, so her response might be seen as more extreme. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she was addressing a personal boundary issue. The guy started the invasion of privacy, and her response was a way to show the inequality. However, using his insecurity might be a gray area. But overall, the initial question was the problem, and her reaction was in self-defense. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
