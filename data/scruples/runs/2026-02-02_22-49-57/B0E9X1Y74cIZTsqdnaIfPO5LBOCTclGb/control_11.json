Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after a situation where they asked a guy about his penis size following him asking about her weight.\n\nFirst, the guy asked her weight after seeing a post about a weightlifter. She felt uncomfortable but answered. Then he made a comment about her weight compared to his, which she took as an insult. She confronted him, and he defended himself. She then asked him about his penis size to show how his insecurity was hurtful. He got embarrassed and didn't apologize. Her friends called her an asshole because she used his insecurity against him.\n\nSo, the key points are: he asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable, then she retaliated by asking a similarly personal question about his body. The friends think she overreacted because she knew his insecurity. \n\nLegally, there's no right answer here, but in social terms, the question is about boundaries. He initiated by asking about her weight, which is sensitive. She felt it was invasive and then mirrored his behavior. The friends see it as her using his insecurity, which might be seen as unfair since he didn't know her sensitivity beforehand. However, she did address his comment and tried to make him see her perspective. \n\nIn terms of social norms, asking about weight or penis size is generally considered intrusive. Both parties crossed a line, but she responded to his initial transgression. The fact that he didn't apologize and she used his insecurity might make her actions seem like retaliation. However, she had reason to be upset about his comment. \n\nThe friends' reaction is also important. They might be defending him because of his previous behavior. But the question is whether she's the asshole. She did ask a personal question in return, which could be seen as equally inappropriate. However, she was responding to his comment. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because she was reacting to his initial intrusive question and his dismissive attitude. Her response was a way to show the hurtful nature of his question. Even though asking about penis size is personal, she had a valid reason in context. The friends' judgment might be biased. So she's not in the wrong.\n"
