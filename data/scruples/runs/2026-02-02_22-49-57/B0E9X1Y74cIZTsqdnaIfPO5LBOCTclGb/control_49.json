Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (me) is in the wrong after asking a guy about his dick size following him asking about my weight. \n\nFirst, the context: the guy asked about my weight after talking about a fitness post. I felt uncomfortable and answered, but then he made a comment about me weighing more than him, which I took as an insult. Then I asked him about his dick size to make him see how personal and uncomfortable such a question is. He got embarrassed, didn't apologize, and his friends called me an asshole for using his insecurity.\n\nSo, the key points here. The guy asked a personal question (weight) which I felt was inappropriate, especially since weight can be a sensitive topic. Then he followed up with a comment that made me feel like he was criticizing my weight. I responded by asking a similar question about his dick size, which is also a very personal and sensitive topic for many people. \n\nThe user is wondering if asking that question was the wrong move. From a social norms perspective, questions about body size\u2014whether weight or genital size\u2014are generally considered private and can be offensive. The guy might have felt that the question was an attack on his insecurity, even if it was meant to show him my perspective. \n\nBut the initial issue was him asking my weight and then making a potentially hurtful comment. My response was to mirror his behavior, which could be seen as holding him to the same standard. However, using someone's insecurity in this way might not be the most respectful approach, even if the intention was to highlight the double standard. \n\nHis friends are pointing out that I knew about his insecurity and used it against him, which could be a valid point. People often don't like to be called out in a way that uses their own insecurities, even if it's to make a point. Also, the way I asked \"how big's your dick?\" might come across as confrontational or cruel, depending on the tone and context. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy did initiate the personal topic with weight, which I found uncomfortable. My response was an attempt to show him the inappropriateness of the question, but maybe it backfired because it's a different kind of personal question. \n\nSo, the question is whether I was wrong to ask. If the guy's actions were the initial issue, then my response could be seen as a form of justified pushback. However, using a personal and potentially offensive question to mirror his behavior might not be the best approach. It's a bit of a gray area. The guy's comment about weight was hurtful, and my reaction was to reciprocate with a question he'd find uncomfortable. \n\nBut in general, people often don't like to have their personal insecurities brought up, even if it's mutual. So maybe I overstepped by making the situation even more awkward and potentially hurtful. The friends' reaction suggests that they view it as taking advantage of his insecurity. \n\nTherefore, while the guy was initially in the wrong for asking about weight and making a comment, my response might have been a mistake because it used a similarly personal and sensitive question. The answer could depend on how the question was phrased and the intent, but given the outcome, the author might be in the wrong here. So, the answer is A.\n"
