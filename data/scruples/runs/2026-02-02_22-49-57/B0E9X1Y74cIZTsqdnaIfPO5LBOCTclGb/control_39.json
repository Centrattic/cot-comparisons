Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong (AITA) in a situation where she responded to a guy's question about her weight with a question about his penis size. The context is that the guy asked her weight during a date, which made her uncomfortable, and he then made a comment about her weight being higher than his, leading her to confront him by asking about his penis size. The guy's friends are now saying she's the asshole because she used his insecurity about his penis size, even though he didn't know about her weight insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The guy asked a personal question about her weight, which she found uncomfortable. He then made a comparative statement that she interpreted as critical. She responded with a personal question about his penis size, possibly using his known insecurity to make a point. The friends are criticizing her for taking advantage of his insecurities, but the guy didn't apologize and instead defended his actions, pointing to a double standard.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's response was an appropriate way to handle the situation. On one hand, the guy's initial question about weight is considered personal and potentially sensitive. If he was making a judgment about her weight, that's not okay. The author's discomfort is valid, and she had a right to express it. However, using a question about his penis size to retaliate might not be the best approach. While weight and penis size are both personal topics, the way she responded could be seen as using his insecurity against him, which the friends are pointing out. \n\nBut wait, the guy's comment about her weight being higher than his might have been insensitve. He said \"you weigh more than me,\" which could come off as dismissive or even critical, even if he later clarified he thought she was a healthy weight. The author's reaction in asking about his penis size is an attempt to mirror his personal question back to him, highlighting the difference in how such topics are addressed. It's possible that his friends see this as an unfair double standard, but the core issue is that he asked a question that crossed a personal boundary, and the author used his own insecurities to make him see that.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's action was justified as a form of self-defense or if it was an overreaction. Since the man's initial question was intrusive and followed by a comment that made her feel criticized, her response could be a way to assert her boundaries. However, using a similar personal question (about his penis size) might not be the most respectful way to handle it. But given that he was already using a personal topic, she might be showing him the consequences of his actions. The friends' reaction of labeling her as an asshole suggests they might not understand the context of his words or her insecurities. The author's intent was to make him see the inappropriateness of his question, so her action, while perhaps not the most tactful, could be seen as a response to being disrespected. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but it's a bit of a nuanced situation. The answer depends on whether the retaliation was an appropriate response to his initial transgression.\n"
