Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author of the \"AITA?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author about her weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked him about his dick size as a way to show him how his question made her feel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy asked her weight after discussing a woman's weightlifting feat. The author found the question personal and offensive, leading to her asking him about his insecurities regarding his own body. He didn't respond and was embarrassed. His friends later criticized her for \"overreacting\" by pointing out his insecurity.\n\nNow, evaluating who is in the wrong. The guy asked a personal question without considering her comfort. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and it's reasonable for the author to feel uncomfortable. By asking his question, he might have triggered her insecurities. When she responded with her own question about his dick size, it was a way to mirror his behavior and show him her discomfort. However, some might see her response as going too far, using his vulnerability to make a point. But others might argue it's a valid reaction to highlight the double standard in what's considered personal.\n\nThe friends' reactions suggest they see her as the problem, but their judgment might be biased, especially if they've teased him about his size. The key points are intent and sensitivity. The guy didn't apologize, which indicates he might not have realized the impact of his question. The author's action was a form of communication to make him understand her perspective. While her response could be seen as confrontational, it's a reaction to his initial insensitivity. \n\nIn many cases, people are entitled to set boundaries around their comfort. The author didn't have to answer the weight question but did, then felt the need to address his comment. Her question about his body was a way to empathize with his position. However, using someone's insecurity against them might not be the best approach. But given the context, it's a teachable moment. \n\nOverall, the guy's initial question was inconsiderate. The author's response was a way to communicate her feelings, which is valid. The friends' judgment might be misplaced. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
