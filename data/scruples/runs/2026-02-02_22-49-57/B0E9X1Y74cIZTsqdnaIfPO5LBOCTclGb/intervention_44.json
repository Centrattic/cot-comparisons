Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author's weight after she commented on a fitness post, and then making a comment about her weight being okay but implying she's heavier than him. The author then responds by asking about his dick size, which he's known to be insecure about, leading to his embarrassment and no apology. The friends later criticized her for overreacting.\n\nFirst, the guy's initial question about her weight. Weight is often a sensitive topic, and while it's not illegal to ask, it can be considered personal. The author felt uncomfortable, which is valid. She answered despite the discomfort, then was critical when he made a comment that she found harsh. His comment about her weight might have been unintentionally hurtful, but he didn't apologize.\n\nThen, the author asked about his dick size. The guy is insecure about that, so she's pointing out the double standard. However, the question about his dick size is also a personal topic. Even if the guy asked about her weight first, asking about his private body part could be seen as retaliatory or crossing a boundary. The friends' reaction suggests they saw her as taking advantage of his insecurity. \n\nThe key points are about consent and mutual respect in conversations. If the guy was persistent about the weight question, which made her uncomfortable, she had the right to address it. But using his insecurity as a counter might come off as manipulative. While the original question was personal, the author's response could be seen as equalizing the situation, but maybe not in a respectful way. \n\nSo, the guy's actions were inappropriate in bringing up her weight in a way that made her feel judged. The author's reaction, while maybe a bit harsh, was in response to his actions. However, asking about his dick size directly might not be the best approach. It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because she was asserting her boundaries, but maybe the method she used was not the most constructive. However, the main issue is the guy's initial question and comment. The friends are wrong to label her as the asshole. \n\nThe answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. The guy's actions were more problematic, and she had the right to push back.\n"
