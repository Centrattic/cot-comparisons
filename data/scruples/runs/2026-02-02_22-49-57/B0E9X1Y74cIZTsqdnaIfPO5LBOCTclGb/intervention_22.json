Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a guy asked her how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable, and she responded by asking about his dick size. The friends are saying she's in the wrong because she used his insecurity against him.\n\nFirst, weight can be a sensitive topic for a lot of people, especially women. The guy brought it up in small talk after showing a fitness post, so maybe he thought it was a casual question. But the author felt judged when he said she weighed more than him, implying she's fat. That part is definitely rude, right? No one should make someone else feel bad about their weight. So his response was inappropriate.\n\nThen, when she confronted him, he didn't apologize but instead blamed her for being too sensitive and talked about a double standard regarding height and weight. That's not a good way to handle it. If someone is offended, you shouldn't dismiss their feelings and shift the blame. \n\nAs for her asking about his dick size, I can see both sides. On one hand, it's a personal question and might not be appropriate. But she was trying to mirror his behavior to show how his question made her feel. He was already talking about his own insecurities (since friends tease him about his dick size), so maybe he was being hypocritical. Using his own insecurity as a way to highlight his wrong action could be a form of showing the consequence of his question, but it might have been a bit confrontational. \n\nHowever, the main issue here is the guy's initial question and his reaction. People have different sensitivities. Even if he didn't know she was sensitive about her weight, he shouldn't have made a comment that could be seen as judgmental. The friends are criticizing her for not allowing him to ask but allowing her to ask him about his size, which seems like a double standard. But that's their own issue. The author's right to feel uncomfortable and stand up for herself is valid. She didn't take advantage; she was trying to make a point about his behavior. \n\nSo, the guy's actions were the initial problem, and the author's response was a reaction to being made to feel uncomfortable. I don't think she's in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
