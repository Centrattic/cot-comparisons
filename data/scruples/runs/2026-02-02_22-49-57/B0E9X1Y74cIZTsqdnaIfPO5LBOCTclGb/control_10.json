Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. So the user is asking if the person who wrote about this situation is the asshole (AITA). The scenario involves a guy in their friend group who asked how much she weighs during a date. She felt uncomfortable and then retaliated by asking about his dick size, which led to some backlash from his friends.\n\nFirst, the guy asked her weight after commenting on a female weightlifter's post. The question of weight can be sensitive, especially in a dating context. The author says she didn't want to make him feel bad, so she answered, but then he made a comment about her weighing more than him. That's when she got angry and asked why he asked. He responded in a way that felt harsh, and then he defended himself by talking about double standards regarding body insecurities.\n\nShe then used his known insecurity about his dick size to mirror his behavior, asking him how big it is. He became embarrassed and asked her to stop. After that, his friends called her an overreacting bitch because she knew his insecurity but he didn't know hers. The author is now wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points are: Is it okay for him to ask her weight, and then for her to ask him about his dick size in response? Let's consider social norms here. Typically, asking someone's weight can be seen as intrusive, especially if it's done in a way that makes the person feel judged. The guy's follow-up comment about her weighing more than him sounds dismissive and possibly judgmental, which could justify her feeling upset. \n\nWhen she asked him about his dick size, it's a personal question too. However, she used his known insecurity as a way to make him see her perspective. While that might be seen as a clever tactic, it's also a form of using his vulnerability against him. But wait, he initially asked a personal question, so she reciprocated with another. Is that fair?\n\nThe friends' reactions suggest they think she overreacted because she was aware of his insecurity. The issue here is whether his question was appropriate in the first place. If he was being disrespectful by linking her weight to his comment about her being \"ok weight for her height and age,\" that's a problem. His defense about double standards might be a way to deflect his own inappropriate behavior.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the guy probably crossed a boundary by asking her weight in a way that made her uncomfortable. Her response was a direct reflection of the personal nature of his question, so it's about mutual respect. If he's not respecting her boundaries, then her standing up for herself isn't wrong. The friends' teasing and labeling her as the asshole might be influenced by their own views on body shaming and what they consider acceptable. \n\nSo, considering that the guy initiated the personal question and she was trying to make him realize the impact of his words, her actions might be justified. The fact that his friends are now calling her an asshole could be because they don't see the initial question as wrong. But from an outsider perspective, both questions are personal, and his approach was likely disrespectful. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
