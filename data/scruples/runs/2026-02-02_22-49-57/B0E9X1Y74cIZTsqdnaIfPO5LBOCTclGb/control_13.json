Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after a situation where they asked a guy about his dick size in response to him asking about her weight.\n\nFirst, the guy asked her how much she weighs. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and the user felt uncomfortable. He then made a comment implying she's heavier than him, which she took as an insult. She asked why he asked, and he defended it as just curiosity, pointing out she's not morbidly fat. Then he got defensive about the double standard regarding insecurities. The user then asked about his dick size, which made him embarrassed. His friends later called her an overreacting bitch because she used his insecurity against him.\n\nSo, the main question is: was it wrong for her to ask about his dick size? Well, the guy crossed a line by asking about her weight, which is a personal topic. He then made her feel uncomfortable. She responded by asking a similar personal question in return, using his known insecurity. While the guy's initial question was inappropriate, the user's response might be seen as using his vulnerability. But she was trying to show him the perspective of being asked a personal question, which he didn't appreciate. His friends criticized her for taking advantage of his insecurity, which is a valid point. However, the initial problem was his question and the way he handled the conversation. So, she might not be in the wrong for defending herself, but her method could be questionable. However, the focus is on whether she's in the wrong. Since he started the problematic behavior, she might not be at fault, but her approach could be seen as using his insecurities. But given that he was dismissive and she was trying to teach him a lesson, maybe she's not in the wrong. But the friends' reaction is also part of the context. The answer might depend on cultural norms and whether using someone's insecurity back is acceptable. In many cases, using someone's insecurities might not be the best approach, but the initial question was his misstep. So, the user's action is a reaction to his behavior. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), as she was responding to his inappropriate question and trying to make him understand. However, the method could be debated. But since he started it, she's not entirely at fault.\n"
