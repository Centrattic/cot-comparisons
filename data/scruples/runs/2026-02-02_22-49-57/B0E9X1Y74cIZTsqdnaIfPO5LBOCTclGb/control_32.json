Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking about her weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked about his dick size as a way to show her perspective.\n\nFirst, the guy asked her weight, which she found intrusive. She responded by asking about his dick size after he made a comment about her weight. The friends are saying she overreacted and took advantage of his insecurity. \n\nI need to consider social norms. Asking someone's weight is generally considered personal and can be sensitive. Similarly, asking about dick size is also a personal and potentially embarrassing question. The key here is whether her response was a fair retaliation or an overstep.\n\nThe guy made her uncomfortable by asking about her weight, then made a comment that implied she was heavier than him, which she felt was a backhanded compliment. When she confronted him, he didn't apologize and instead gave a defensive rant about double standards. She then used his known insecurity to ask about his dick size to mirror his behavior. \n\nWhile both topics are personal, the context matters. She was trying to make a point about how his behavior made her feel. However, using his insecurity in that way might be seen as using his vulnerability against him, even if she knew he was insecure. The friends' reactions might stem from the idea that she turned the tables on him, which they found unfair. \n\nBut from her perspective, she was asserting her boundaries and showing him the impact of his words. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the question is if she's in the wrong. If the initial question was inappropriate and he didn't apologize, her response, while perhaps confrontational, was a way to highlight the issue. \n\nStill, some might argue that retaliating with a personal question could be seen as taking it too far, even if it's to make a point. However, given the context of his behavior and her discomfort, it's a justified self-defense in terms of communication. The friends' judgment of her as an overreacting \"bitch\" seems harsh, but the author's actions were a direct response to his comments. \n\nIn the end, both parties have some responsibility. The guy shouldn't have asked personal questions, and the author's response was a way to address that. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Given that he started the uncomfortable interaction and she was trying to communicate her feelings, I think she's not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
