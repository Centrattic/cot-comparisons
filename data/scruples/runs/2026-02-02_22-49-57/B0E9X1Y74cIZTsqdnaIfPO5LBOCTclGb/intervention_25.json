Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation where they asked a guy about his dick size after he asked about their weight.\n\nFirst, the guy asked her weight, which she found uncomfortable. Weight is a sensitive topic, and while it's a common question, it's considered personal. She had to answer because she didn't want to make him feel bad. Then he made a comment that she interpreted as her being fat, which upset her. She challenged his comment, and he defended himself by bringing up double standards about discrimination based on height (which is unchangeable) versus weight (which is changeable). \n\nThe author then used his insecurity about his dick size to mirror his question, which made him embarrassed. The friends judged her as overreacting because she used his insecurity against him. \n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points are: \n\n1. He asked a personal question (weight) that made her uncomfortable. \n2. His response to her weight was making her feel self-conscious, implying she's fat. \n3. She asked about his dick size to show him how his question made her feel. \n\nThe guy initiated the sensitive question, which is the root of the conflict. Her response was to mirror his behavior, which could be seen as a form of emotional response to his initial comment. While using his insecurity might be seen as using a personal against him, the initial issue was his inappropriate question. \n\nHowever, some might argue that her response was crossing a line by asking about his body part, which is also personal. But the context is that she was reacting to his prior behavior. \n\nIn terms of social norms, both weight and body size are sensitive topics. The guy's question was the catalyst. The author's reaction, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, was a response to his initiating the sensitive topic and then being defensive. \n\nThe friends' judgment of her as the \"bitch\" seems to support the idea that they didn't understand his initial wrongdoing. Her actions were a form of emotional response to his comments. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong because she was responding to his initial inappropriate question and comment. The key issue is his starting the sensitive topic and making her feel bad, leading her to mirror his actions to show the discomfort. So the answer is B.\n"
