Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking about the guy's dick size after he asked her weight. The context is that the guy asked her weight, which made her uncomfortable, and then he made a comment about her weight being \"ok\" but not \"morbidly fat.\" She confronted him, and he started a rant about double standards regarding insecurities. Then she used his known insecurity about his dick size to mirror his behavior, which made him embarrassed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Asking someone their weight is often seen as a personal question, especially for women, due to societal emphasis on body image. The guy's question could be perceived as intrusive. The author felt uncomfortable and decided to ask a reciprocal question to illustrate the double standard she felt he was bringing up. \n\nThe guy's response to her weight question was dismissive and even a bit harsh, which probably escalated her discomfort. When she asked about his dick size, it's a similar type of personal question, but one that men often find more offensive when asked by women. However, the author's intention was to highlight the inconsistency in his argument about double standards and how such questions can be hurtful regardless of the topic.\n\nThe friends are criticizing her for using his insecurity against him, but the key point is whether her action was a justified response. Since the guy initiated the personal question and then criticized her for being sensitive, her reaction could be seen as a way to demonstrate the very behavior he was complaining about. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action was a form of self-defense in the conversation, using his own insecurities to mirror his behavior. While both questions are personal, the power dynamic and societal context around weight and body image for women are different. The author was trying to show that being judgmental about personal traits is not okay, even if the traits are different. So, I think she's not in the wrong.\n"
