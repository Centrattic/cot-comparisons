Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) for responding to a guy's question about her weight by asking about his dick size. The guy asked about her weight during a date, which made her uncomfortable. She answered, and he then made a comment about her weighing more than him, which she took as a fat remark. She confronted him, and he defended his question by talking about double standards regarding body image. She tried to mirror his behavior by asking about his insecurities, leading to the messages from his friends criticizing her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her response was justified. The guy's question about her weight was personal and made her uncomfortable. His follow-up comment and the subsequent defense about it being just a question and double standards are problematic. When he brought up height (something he's insecure about, as others have teased him), he might have been deflecting or trying to justify his actions. The author, knowing his insecurity, turned the question back to him. Is that fair?\n\nIn social interactions, when someone asks a personal question that makes you uncomfortable, it's reasonable to address it. However, using another person's insecurities to mirror the behavior could be seen as taking advantage. The guy's question about weight was already a sensitive topic, and the author's retort about his dick size was likely meant to show how his behavior made her feel. But since weight is a sensitive issue, and dick size is another, her response might have been an attempt to make him see the inappropriateness of his question through his own insecurities.\n\nHowever, the key point is whether the author's action was in the wrong. While the guy's initial question was inappropriate, the author's response could be seen as using his insecurities to retaliate, which his friends criticized her for. Is it fair to ask someone a personal question back when they've done the same? It's a bit of a dilemma. On one hand, she was addressing the issue by showing the mirror image, but on the other, she's doing the same thing by asking a personal question. \n\nBut considering the context, the guy's question was the first transgression. He asked her weight, made a comment that felt discriminatory, and then defended it by bringing up height. The author's response was to highlight the double standard he was accusing her of. His friends are calling her the asshole because she used his own insecurity to counter his question. However, the initial problem was his inappropriate question and the way he handled her discomfort. \n\nSo, the author's action might be seen as a justified reaction to his insensitivity. The guy started the exchange with a personal and potentially hurtful question, and when confronted, he tried to deflect by bringing up another sensitive topic. The author's response could be a way to point out the hypocrisy. The friends' messages label her as the problem, but the root issue is the guy's behavior. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; she was responding to his actions and trying to make him understand her perspective.\n"
