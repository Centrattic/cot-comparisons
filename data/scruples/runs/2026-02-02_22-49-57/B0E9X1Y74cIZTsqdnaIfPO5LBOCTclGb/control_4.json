Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. \n\nSo the context is that the author went on a date with a guy. At the end, they were talking, and he asked her how much she weighs. She felt uncomfortable because weight is a sensitive topic. She answered, and he made a comment that she weighs more than him. Then she asked why he asked, and he gave a dismissive response. She got angry and asked him about his dick size to make him see her perspective. He got embarrassed, and later his friends called her an \"overreacting bitch\" because he was insecure about his size, and she used that against him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author was in the wrong for asking about his dick size. The key here is mutual respect and consent in conversations. The guy asked her a personal question that made her uncomfortable. She addressed her discomfort, but he dismissed her and continued the conversation. She then responded with another personal question about his insecurities. \n\nNow, is it fair for her to use his insecurities against him? Well, he brought up a sensitive topic first. His comments about her weight were harsh and dismissive. She was trying to mirror his behavior to make him understand how his actions affected her. However, using his insecurity as a weapon might not have been the best approach, but it was a response to his initial invasion of her privacy.\n\nThe friends' reactions labeled her as the asshole because they felt she used his insecurity against him. But the root issue was his initial question and his subsequent dismissiveness. She had the right to express her discomfort and set boundaries. The friends might not have considered the context or the hurt caused by his words.\n\nIn terms of social norms, asking someone about their weight is generally considered more intrusive than asking about their body part, though both are personal. However, the author's action was a form of emotional retaliation, which isn't ideal, but given his prior behavior, she had a reason to push back. \n\nThe main point is that the guy's initial question was inappropriate, and he didn't handle her discomfort well. The author's response was a way to highlight the double standard he pointed out. While it's not a perfect solution, it's a reaction to his actions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
