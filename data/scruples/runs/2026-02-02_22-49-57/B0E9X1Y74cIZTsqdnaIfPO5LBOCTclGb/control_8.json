Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the guy asked the woman out on a date. At the end of the date, they were making small talk. The guy showed her a post about a female weightlifter, then asked her how much she weighs. She felt uncomfortable and answered, even though it made her feel bad. Then he commented that she weighs more than him, which made her angry. She asked why he asked, and he defended himself, saying she's not morbidly fat but still being critical. Then she asked about his dick size, which made him embarrassed. The friends later called her an overreacting bitch because she used his insecurity against him.\n\nFirst, the guy asked a personal question about her weight, which she found offensive. She had the right to feel uncomfortable. Weight is a sensitive topic, and asking it in a social context can be intrusive. His follow-up comments about her weight being \"ok\" but implying she's not as good as the weightlifter adds to the problem. He didn't consider her feelings and was defensive when confronted.\n\nWhen she asked about his dick size, it was a way to mirror the personal question he asked her. It showed she was trying to make him see how his behavior affected her. He became embarrassed, but she stopped when he asked. The friends' reaction is also important\u2014they think she's the problem because she used his insecurity against him. But that doesn't make her wrong. The guy was the one who initiated the personal question without considering her boundaries.\n\nThe key points are: 1) He asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable. 2) He made a critical comment about her weight. 3) She responded by asking a similar personal question to highlight the double standard. 4) Friends blamed her for overreacting, not the initial aggressor.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the person who made the initial offensive move is usually the one at fault. Here, the guy's actions led to the conflict. The woman was defending herself by using his insecurities to show the double standard. Even though the friends disagree, the context supports her actions as a response to his inappropriate behavior. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
