Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after a situation involving a personal question about weight and then reciprocating with a question about his dick size.\n\nFirst, the guy asked the author how much she weighs. That's a sensitive topic for many people, especially women. The author felt uncomfortable and answered reluctantly. Then he said she weighs more than him, which made her feel like he was calling her fat. She confronted him about the question, and he dismissed her feelings, leading her to retaliate with a question about his penis size. He got embarrassed and she stopped, but he didn't apologize. \n\nThe friends later criticized the author for overreacting, using the fact that she knew his insecurity about his dick size to argue she used that against him. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nHmm. So, the key points are: personal questions, the guy's dismissive response, the author's attempt to mirror his behavior to make a point. The guy's statement about her weight being \"ok\" but not \"morbidly fat\" seems like a backhanded compliment, adding to the discomfort. \n\nAsking someone's weight can be seen as intrusive, especially if the person is sensitive about it. The author's choice to ask about his dick size in return might be an example of \"leading by example\" or \"teaching a lesson\" by showing him how it feels to be asked something personal. But is that justified?\n\nFrom a social perspective, it's often considered rude to ask someone their weight. If the guy crossed a line by asking that, then the author's response might be a way to express her discomfort. However, using the same approach could be seen as escalating the conflict. The guy's friends are probably judgmental because they see the author's action as taking advantage of his insecurity, but does that matter? \n\nThe guy's behavior included making a comment that implied he thought her weight was a negative, even if he later said it was \"ok.\" His defense about a double standard and not apologizing might show a lack of empathy. The author's response was to use his own insecurity to mirror his behavior. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she was defending her boundaries by showing him the impact of his question. However, some might argue that asking about his penis size was an overreaction. But given the context of his dismissiveness and the toxic environment from his friends, her action was a form of standing up for herself. The friends' response reinforces the idea that personal questions are a double standard. So, the answer is likely B.\n"
