Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking her weight, which made her uncomfortable, and then she responded by asking about his insecurities regarding his anatomy. The friends are now saying she's the asshole because she used his insecurity against him, even though he didn't know about her weight insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Weight is a sensitive topic, and it's not uncommon for people to feel uncomfortable when asked directly. The guy's question might have been innocent, but it's clear it made her uneasy. When she asked about his insecurities, he got embarrassed and didn't apologize. His friends are defending him, suggesting a double standard.\n\nThe key points are: 1. The guy's question about her weight led to her feeling targeted. 2. She used his known insecurity to mirror his actions. 3. The friends are calling her the asshole because she knew his insecurity but he didn't know hers. \n\nIs it fair that she used his insecurity? Well, she was trying to make him see how his actions affected her. But maybe her response was a bit provocative, especially since she knew his vulnerability. However, the initial question was still intrusive. It's a bit of a gray area. But the main issue is that the guy made an invasive comment, which is why she reacted. The friends' reaction seems to be more about double standards. The answer likely leans towards her not being in the wrong because he started it with a personal question. But she escalated it by using his insecurities. Hmm. Maybe she's not the asshole here because the initial transgression was his.\n"
