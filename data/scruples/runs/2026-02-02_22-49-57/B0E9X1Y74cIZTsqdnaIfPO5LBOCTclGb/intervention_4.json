Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person they refer to as \"the author\" is in the wrong after a specific situation. So, first, I need to understand the scenario clearly.\n\nThe author went on a date with a guy. At the end, they were making small talk and he showed her a post about a female weightlifter. The guy commented on her weight and lifting capacity, then asked the author her weight. She was uncomfortable, said \"excuse me?\" and eventually answered. He then made a comment that she weighs more than him, which made her feel he was calling her fat. She confronted him, and he justified it by saying it's a \"double standard\" between how people talk about height (which you can't control) versus weight (which you can). She then asked about his dick size, referencing his insecurity about it, which he found embarrassing. After that, his friends messaged her, saying she was overreacting because she used his insecurity against him despite knowing it, and she's the asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my take. They want me to answer A or B based on analysis.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the guy asked a personal question about weight, which she found uncomfortable. He then compared her weight to his, making her feel criticized. She asked about his dick size to mirror his behavior, which he found embarrassing. He didn't apologize, and his friends blamed her for overreacting by using his insecurity while he didn't know hers.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's response was appropriate. The guy asked a personal question, which can be problematic. She felt it was intrusive and responded with a question of her own about a different personal topic (dick size). The friends argue that she knew his insecurity but didn't know his, so she took advantage. But is that a valid argument?\n\nWeight is often considered a sensitive topic, even though it's physical. Height is also sensitive, but people might handle it differently. The guy's comment about her weighing more than him could be seen as a backhanded compliment, implying she's heavier than him in a way that's not positive. The author's reaction was to confront the behavior by mirroring it with a question about his insecurity. This is a form of psychological mirroring to make him see how his actions affected her. \n\nThe friends' criticism is that she was using his known insecurity against him, but they don't consider that they might have different sensitivities. The guy's initial question was personal, and his response after she answered was dismissive and harsh. By asking about his dick size, she was trying to get him to empathize, not to attack. \n\nIn terms of social norms, asking someone's weight is generally seen as more sensitive than asking about height, even though both are personal. The guy's argument about a double standard is flawed because he's equating two different things and using that as justification for his own intrusive question. The author's follow-up question was a way to highlight the inconsistency in his behavior. \n\nThe fact that the guy didn't apologize and instead his friends blamed her suggests that the issue is more about his actions and the group's perspective. The author's intent was to express her discomfort and make him see her point, not to be malicious. So, the author likely isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
