Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for asking about the guy's dick size after he asked her about her weight.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy asked her weight, which made her uncomfortable. He then made a comment that she weighs more than him, and she felt he was implying she was fat. She responded by asking why he asked and then countered by asking about his dick size. The friends are saying she's the asshole because she knew he was insecure about that, so she used it against him.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about mutual respect and sensitivity. The guy asked a personal question about her weight, which is a sensitive topic. Then he made a comment that could be seen as rude. She then asked a similarly personal question about his body part, which is also sensitive. The friends are saying she did it on purpose to get him to see her point of view, using his insecurity.\n\nBut is it fair that she asked him back? Well, the guy initiated the personal question. She felt uncomfortable, and then he made a comment that made her angrier. She tried to make him see her perspective by asking a question that's similar in nature. However, using his insecurity might be seen as manipulative, even if she had a point. But the guy didn't apologize, and the friends are criticizing her for overreacting. \n\nOn one hand, the guy shouldn't have asked her weight without considering her feelings. On the other, she retaliated with a question he found embarrassing. But maybe she was just trying to show him the double standard. However, the friends argue that she's the one who took advantage of his known insecurity. \n\nI think the main issue is that both parties asked personal questions, but the guy started it. However, her response might have been a justified attempt to make him understand her side. But maybe she shouldn't have asked such a personal question, even if she knew he was insecure. It's a bit of a back-and-forth. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, the guy asked the initial sensitive question and made a comment that hurt her feelings. Then she asked a similar question to show him the double standard. The friends are saying she's the asshole because she used his insecurity. But if she was trying to make a point, maybe she overstepped even if she had a reason. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether her action was a reasonable response or if it was crossing a line. If she was trying to make a point about double standards, perhaps she did it in a way that was too harsh. But the guy's initial behavior was also problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the guy's initial question and comments were rude, but the author's response might have been a way to confront the double standard. However, using his insecurity might not have been the best approach. But the friends are calling her the asshole because she knew about his insecurity. \n\nGiven that, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The guy started it, and she was trying to make a point. However, maybe she could have handled it differently. But since the question is whether she is in the wrong, the answer might be B (No), because she was responding to his initial transgression and trying to highlight the double standard.\n"
