Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the guy asked the author how much she weighs. The author found this uncomfortable and even offensive, especially because the guy later made a comment about her weighing more than him. She responded by asking him about his dick size, which made him embarrassed, and then the friend group is upset with her, calling her an overreacting bitch. The question is whether she was in the wrong for asking about his dick size in response.\n\nSo, let's start by analyzing the initial interaction. The guy asked her weight after making a comment about a female weightlifter. Weight can be a sensitive topic for many people, and the author felt that the question was personal and made her uncomfortable. When he repeated the question, she answered but then he said she weighed more than him. That's when she got angry and asked about his dick size to make a point.\n\nNow, the key points here are the dynamics of the conversation and the intent behind the questions and responses. The guy initiated the topic of weight by commenting on the athlete's stats and then asked the author's weight. The author's response was to immediately ask about his dick size, which is also a personal and sensitive topic for many. The friends are upset because they think she used his insecurity against him, even though he had previously made her uncomfortable.\n\nI need to consider if the author's response was a reasonable reaction. The guy's comment about her weighing more than him could be seen as a backhanded compliment or even a subtle insult, depending on tone and intent. The author might have felt that by asking about his dick size, she was highlighting the double standard in how personal such questions are when directed at each gender. However, using a similar approach to retaliate might not be the best strategy, even if it's to make a point.\n\nBut is the author at fault? Well, the first thing is that the guy asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable. She had the right to feel that way and to express her discomfort. By asking about his dick size, she was trying to show him how his question felt to her. While that might be a confrontational way to address it, it's a form of mirroring the behavior to make a point. However, some might argue that personal questions about body size are never appropriate, regardless of the direction. But the author's action was a direct response to his previous question and comment, which was uncomfortable and potentially discriminatory.\n\nThe friends' reaction is also important. They're pointing out that the author knew about his insecurity and used it against him. But does that make her in the wrong? If she was defending her own boundaries and trying to illustrate the hurtfulness of his question, even if it's a bit of a tit-for-tat approach, maybe she's not at fault. Though, in some contexts, bringing up such a personal question might be seen as crossing a line, especially if the person is known to be insecure about it.\n\nAlso, the guy didn't apologize, which could indicate he was in the wrong for making her uncomfortable. The author's action might have been a way to assert her boundaries and make him see her perspective. So, while the response might be seen as harsh, it's in reaction to something that made her uncomfortable. The friends' judgment of her as the asshole seems to be based on their perception of the double standard, where they think men should be allowed to ask about women's weight without consequence, and women shouldn't bring up men's body insecurities. But that might reflect their own biases rather than the actual right or wrong.\n\nIn terms of social norms, asking about someone's weight can be intrusive and is often considered rude. The author felt it was a personal question and responded in kind. Some might say that responding with a personal question isn't the best approach, but the core issue is the guy's initial question and his subsequent comment. The author's action was a direct attempt to make him see her point of view, which is about respecting personal boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The guy asked a sensitive question that made her uncomfortable. She tried to explain her discomfort but was met with defensiveness and lectures about double standards. She then used his own insecurity to illustrate her point, which led to embarrassment on his part. The friends are defending him, suggesting that she overreacted because she knew his insecurities. However, the author's right to set boundaries and express discomfort is valid. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she was defending her own feelings and pointing out the inconsistency in how such personal questions are treated based on gender.\n"
