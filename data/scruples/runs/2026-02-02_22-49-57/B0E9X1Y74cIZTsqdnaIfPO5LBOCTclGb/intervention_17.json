Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking about her weight after she mentions not being able to deadlift like the woman in the Instagram post. The guy then makes a comment that she interprets as her being fat, leading her to ask about his dick size as a form of showing the double standard.\n\nFirst, the guy's question about her weight was personal and made her uncomfortable. Weight is a sensitive topic for many, so his question might have been inappropriate. Then, his comment that she weighs more than him and his subsequent remark about her not being morbidly fat could be seen as dismissive and potentially hurtful. His defense that he was just curious and that there's a double standard in how people are judged (height vs. weight) might not hold up because weight is something people can change, unlike height, which is a common argument in double standard discussions.\n\nThe author's response was to ask about his dick size, which is also a personal question. However, she did this to highlight the double standard he brought up. She stopped when he asked her to, so she didn't press further. Her friends, however, labeled her as the asshole because she used his insecurity against him, even though she didn't know about his insecurities beforehand. \n\nThe key points here are: the guy initiated the personal question, made her uncomfortable, and then brought up a double standard. The author's response was in reaction to his comments and aimed to show the inconsistency in his argument. While asking about his dick size is a personal question, it was in response to his previous personal inquiry and his argument about double standards. The friends' judgment of her as the asshole might be missing the point of the initial issue with the weight question.\n\nConsidering that the guy started the conversation with a sensitive topic and then made a comment that she found offensive, the author's reaction was in self-defense to show the double standard. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
