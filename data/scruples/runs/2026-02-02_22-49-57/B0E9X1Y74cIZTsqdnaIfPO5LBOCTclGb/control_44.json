Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a guy asked her how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. Then when she asked him about his dick size, which made him embarrassed. The friends are saying she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around personal questions. Asking someone's weight is often seen as intrusive, especially for a woman, as it can be a sensitive topic. The guy in the story asked her weight, and then made a comment comparing it to his own. That comment probably came off as rude or insensitive. The author felt hurt and then asked him about his dick size in response. \n\nNow, the guy's friends are saying she overstepped by using his insecurity against him. But does that mean she's in the wrong? If he made her feel uncomfortable, retaliating in kind might be seen as fair by some, or as just as rude by others. But the key here is that the guy initiated the personal question first. The author was trying to show him the same kind of discomfort he caused her. \n\nAlso, the guy didn't apologize and the friends are taking his side. But the initial question about weight was the first transgression. The author's response was a direct result of his actions. So maybe the fault lies more with him for starting it. However, asking about someone's body in return, even if it's a reciprocal action, could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nBut considering that the guy was dismissive of her feelings and defended his actions by talking about double standards, the author might have felt justified in showing him the same treatment. The friends' reaction is also a sign of a toxic support system for the guy's behavior. \n\nSo, the author's actions were a response to being made uncomfortable first. While asking about his genital size is a personal question, the context was a back-and-forth where he started it. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong because she was responding to his initial intrusion. The answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong)."
