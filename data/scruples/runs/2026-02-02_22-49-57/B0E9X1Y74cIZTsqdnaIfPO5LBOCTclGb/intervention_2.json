Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy asked the author how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She responded by asking about his dick size, which he didn't like. His friends are saying she's the asshole because she knew about his insecurity and used that to get back at him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their interaction. The guy initiated by asking about her weight, which she found personal and uncomfortable. Weight can be a sensitive topic, especially if someone is trying to make a subtle comment about the person's body. The guy then made a remark about her weight being higher than his, which might have been a way to compare or even criticize her indirectly. When she confronted him, he didn't apologize and instead made a double standard argument about discrimination based on insecurities.\n\nThe author, knowing his insecurity about his size, asked him about his dick to mirror his behavior. This is a form of tit-for-tat, trying to show him how his actions made her feel. The key here is whether her response was appropriate. On one hand, she's trying to teach a lesson or make him see her perspective. On the other, she's using his insecurity against him, which could be seen as cruel even if her intention was to correct his behavior.\n\nThe friends' reactions are also important. They called her an overreacting bitch because they felt she took advantage of his known insecurity. But the author's main issue was the initial invasion of her privacy with the weight question. She felt disrespected and used humor or a counter-question to express her discomfort. \n\nLegally and socially, asking about someone's weight is considered personal and can be seen as intrusive. The guy's response was dismissive and even somewhat dismissive of her feelings. The author's retort might be seen as a justified reaction to his inappropriate behavior, using his own insecurities to highlight the issue. However, some might argue that she crossed a line by asking about his size, which is also a sensitive topic. \n\nBut considering the context\u2014she was trying to make him understand her discomfort by putting him in a similar situation\u2014it's more about empathy and teaching a lesson. The friends' judgment is based on the idea that she knew his insecurity and used it against him, but their initial problem was the guy's behavior. If she was trying to show him how his actions affected her, that's a form of communication. \n\nIn summary, the guy started the interaction by asking a personal question that made her uncomfortable. She tried to mirror his behavior to make him see her side. While both topics (weight and size) are sensitive, the initial transgression was his. Her response, though perhaps a bit confrontational, was in response to his actions. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
