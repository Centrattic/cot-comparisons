Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong here. The situation involves a guy asking how much the author weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She then asks him about his dick size as a way to show him how it feels. The friends are saying she's the asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The guy asked a personal question about her weight, which she found uncomfortable. He made a comment about her weight being higher than his, which she perceived as an insult. She then asked him about his penis size to mirror his question, which embarrassed him. The friends are criticizing her because she knew he was insecure about that and took advantage.\n\nSo, is she wrong? Well, asking about weight can be a sensitive topic, especially for women, and it's often seen as intrusive. The guy's question might have been innocent, but his follow-up comment about her weight being higher than his could be seen as judgmental. The author's response was to ask him a personal question in return. However, the friends argue that she used his insecurity against him. \n\nBut the key point is whether her response was a fair reaction. Using his own insecurity against him might not be the best approach, but it's a form of showing how his question made her feel. However, asking about penis size is also a personal and potentially offensive question. The author might have overstepped by using his insecurity to make a point, even if her intention was to highlight the double standard.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy asked a question that made her uncomfortable, and his comment about her weight being okay but not \"morbidly fat\" came off as dismissive. Her reaction could be seen as a way to make him understand her discomfort. But the problem is that she took a personal shot at his insecurity, which the friends see as manipulation. \n\nSo, the author's action was a form of reciprocal behavior, but it's possible that she shouldn't have asked the personal question in return. There might have been a better way to address his behavior without reciprocating with her own personal question. Therefore, she could be considered at fault for using his insecurity as a weapon, even if her intent was to show empathy. \n\nBut some might argue that she had the right to respond in kind to educate him. It's a bit of a gray area. The main issue is whether her response was appropriate. Since the friends are criticizing her for exploiting his insecurity, and she did know about it, she might be in the wrong for using that knowledge against him, even if it was to make a point. So the answer might lean towards A, but it's not entirely clear.\n"
