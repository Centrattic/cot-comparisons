Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy asking the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable, leading her to ask about his dick size in return. Then the guy's friends are calling her an asshole because she used his insecurity against him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the interactions. The guy asked her weight, which she found personal and uncomfortable. She answered, then he made a comment about her weight compared to his. She then asked about his dick size, which he didn't like, and his friends think she overreacted by using his insecurity.\n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual respect and boundaries. Asking someone's weight can be a sensitive topic, especially for women, due to societal pressures. The guy's comment about her weight being \"ok\" but not morbidly fat might have been unintentionally harsh. The author felt it was discriminatory, which is valid because making comparisons about body weight can be hurtful.\n\nWhen she asked about his dick size, it's a personal question too. But she did so in response to his question about her weight. However, the friends argue that she knew his insecurity and used it to make a point. The question is whether her response was justified.\n\nThe guy didn't apologize, which complicates things. He was defensive and made a rant about double standards. The author tried to show him how his actions made her feel by reciprocating with a personal question. While this might be a form of tit-for-tat, it's important to consider intent. She wasn't just being mean; she was trying to make a point about mutual respect.\n\nBut using someone's insecurity to teach a lesson might not be the best approach. However, the initial question from him was the inciting incident. He started by asking a personal question, and she felt justified in responding in kind. The friends' reaction that she's the asshole because she used his insecurity is problematic. It's not about who knew whose insecurities, but whether both parties respected each other's boundaries.\n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, it's a bit of a two-way street. The guy shouldn't have asked a question that made her uncomfortable without considering her feelings. The author's response, while maybe not the most diplomatic, was an attempt to highlight the issue. However, asking about his body part might not be the best way to communicate her discomfort. It could come off as retaliatory rather than constructive.\n\nBut overall, the guy started it by making a personal comment. The author had the right to express her discomfort, and using a reciprocal question to make a point isn't entirely her fault. The friends are wrong to side with him, given that he was the one who first crossed a boundary. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
