Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is dealing with multiple health issues that make physical tasks difficult. They were in a grocery store, saw something on the floor, tried to ask if someone dropped it, got told no, then another woman pushed past and dismissed them. The author tried to explain their situation, was accused of making excuses, called a \"lazy millennial,\" and then the author called her a \"cunt.\"\n\nFirst, the author's health issues are significant. They can't bend down easily, which explains why they couldn't pick up the item. The other woman's behavior seems rude and dismissive. However, the author responded with a derogatory term. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe key points are: the author's context of physical limitations, the other woman's aggressive and judgmental behavior, and the author's response. While the other woman was clearly rude, using a swear word might escalate the situation. However, the author was in pain and provoked. The question is about whether the author's response was justified. Some might argue that even in provocation, using such a term is unprofessional and escalates conflict. Others might say the other person's behavior was worse, so the author's reaction is understandable given their stress and pain.\n\nBut the question is not about who started it. The author is asking if they're in the wrong. Using a swear word, even in response to an insult, can be seen as crossing a line. However, given the context of their health issues and the provocation, some might find it forgivable. The line between a justified reaction and an unprofessional one is thin here. The answer depends on cultural context and personal judgment. But generally, in public settings, responding with a derogatory term might not be the best choice, even if provoked. So, leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A) but understanding the context. However, others might see it as a momentary lapse under stress. Still, the act of calling someone a \"cunt\" is a strong choice, so maybe the author is in the wrong.\n"
