Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling a woman a \"cunt\" in a grocery store situation. The author has several health issues that make it hard for them to bend down. They encountered a situation where they thought someone dropped a package, asked the person in front if they did, and then another woman pushed past and said to leave it. The author tried to explain their inability to bend down, but the woman accused them of making up excuses and called them a \"lazy millennial.\" In response, the author called her a \"cunt.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's health issues are significant and real. They have conditions that make physical tasks like bending difficult and potentially painful or dangerous. That's a valid reason they couldn't pick up the item. However, the way they responded might be an issue. Responding with a derogatory term like \"cunt\" is a strong reaction. Even if the other woman was rude, using such a term could be seen as inappropriate or escalating the situation. \n\nThe other woman did push past the author and made a dismissive comment. The author tried to explain their situation, but the woman didn't acknowledge that. However, the author's response was a verbal attack. While the other person was at fault for being rude and not considering the author's health, the author's use of a swear word might still make them responsible for contributing to the conflict. \n\nIt's important to consider that the author was in pain and possibly frustrated, which might have lowered their patience. But in public situations, how we respond matters. Even if someone else is wrong, responding with a curse might not be the best approach. The friend's comment that the author was being an asshole suggests that the response was uncalled for, regardless of the provocation.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because their response was a direct insult, even if the other person was rude first. However, the context of their health issues could be a mitigating factor. The key here is whether the insult was a proportionate response. Since the other person made a derogatory comment, the author's response could be seen as a justified retort, but the term used is particularly harsh. \n\nIn most social contexts, calling someone a \"cunt\" is seen as unacceptable, regardless of the situation. So even if the other person was at fault, the author's choice of words is likely to be viewed as the wrong action. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
