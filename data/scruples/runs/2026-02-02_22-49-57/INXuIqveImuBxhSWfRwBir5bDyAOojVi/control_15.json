Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about them calling a woman a \"cunt\" at the grocery store.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has various health issues that make it hard for them to bend down or walk properly. They were shopping and saw a package that someone else might have dropped. They asked the person in front if it was theirs, and the person said no. The author couldn't pick it up due to their condition. Another woman pushed past and told them to leave it. The author tried to explain their situation, but the woman dismissed them with an insult. The author then called her a \"cunt.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are the health issues affecting the author's ability to do certain physical tasks, the interaction with the other woman, and the resulting insult. The author's friend said they were an asshole, but they think the other woman started it.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The woman was rude and dismissive, but does that justify the author using a harsh insult? The word \"cunt\" is a strong and offensive term. Even if provoked, using such language in public can be seen as inappropriate. However, the author was in pain and might have been more sensitive. The other woman was also at fault for being dismissive and using an insult.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. While the other woman's behavior was poor, the author's response was also unkind. In a public setting, even if provoked, using a derogatory term is likely to escalate the situation. The author could have responded differently, like ignoring the comment or calmly explaining their situation again. Since they chose to use a swear word, even if it was in response to being called a \"lazy millennial,\" it's possible they are partly at fault. However, considering the health issues and the provocation, some might argue they're not entirely wrong.\n\nBut generally, in AITA contexts, the expectation is to de-escalate conflicts and avoid using offensive language regardless of the provocation. So the answer might lean towards the author being at fault, but there are mitigating circumstances.\n"
