Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about them calling a woman a \"cunt\" at the grocery store. The person has several health issues that make it hard for them to bend down or walk normally. So when they encountered the taco seasoning situation, they tried to ask if someone dropped it, but couldn't pick it up.\n\nThen another woman pushed past them and said \"Fine just leave it then.\" The writer explained they couldn't bend down due to their health, but the woman dismissed them as making up an excuse and called them a \"lazy millennial.\" The writer then responded with \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off.\n\nSo the question is, is the writer in the wrong? Let me break this down. First, the woman was rude and dismissive. She didn't have to push past someone, especially when the writer explained their condition. Then the writer was already in pain and stressed. They might have been triggered because of their own physical limitations and the stress of shopping before a blizzard.\n\nBut the key point is the use of the word \"cunt,\" which is a strong and offensive term. Even if the other woman was being rude, the writer's response was a direct insult. However, the writer's health issues and the context of the situation might play a role in their reaction. People with chronic pain might have lower tolerance for stress, so their reaction could be seen as a result of their circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, using a derogatory term is generally considered inappropriate, regardless of the provocation. It can escalate conflicts and isn't a constructive way to handle a disagreement. The writer's friend said they were being an asshole, which makes sense because the response is harsh. But the woman also started the conflict by being dismissive and making a derogatory comment.\n\nSo, is the writer at fault? They did respond with an insult, but they were in a vulnerable state due to their health. The other woman was also at fault for her behavior. Maybe the situation is a shared responsibility. However, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. Since they used a derogatory term, even if provoked, it's likely they are at least partially in the wrong. But considering their health issues and the provocation, some might argue it's a mutual situation.\n\nBut the options are A (Yes) or B (No). If I have to choose, I think the writer is partially at fault, but not entirely. However, the question is if they are in the wrong. Since using a slur is generally wrong, the answer might be A. But the context could make it more nuanced. Alternatively, maybe the other person's actions were worse, so the writer isn't in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
