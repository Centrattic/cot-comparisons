Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who has various health issues making it hard to bend or walk, was at a grocery store. They saw something on the floor, asked the person in front if they dropped it, and when told no, they moved on. Then another woman pushes past and tells them to leave it. The author tries to explain their inability due to joint pain, but the woman scoffs, accuses them of making up excuses, calls them a \"lazy millennial,\" and says something else. The author, who's already in pain, responds with \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walks off. Their friend says they're being an asshole, but the author thinks the woman started it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They called the woman a \"cunt,\" which is a strong and offensive term. The question is whether that response was in the wrong. The author has valid health issues, which the woman didn't acknowledge. However, responding with a derogatory term, even if provoked, might be seen as an escalation.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman was the one who pushed past, dismissed the author's explanation, and made a derogatory comment. The author was in a vulnerable state due to their health. But does that justify using a swear word? The author's friend thinks they were an asshole. The key here is that the author chose to respond with a curse word, which is disrespectful, regardless of the provocation. The woman's behavior was rude, but the author's response was also unkind and possibly unnecessary. However, the initial provocation might have been worse. But in terms of societal norms, using such language is generally frowned upon, and the author could have responded without the insult. So maybe they are in the wrong because they escalated the conflict with a harsh word. Alternatively, considering their health struggles and the woman's rudeness, it's a gray area. But the act of calling someone a \"cunt\" is a clear violation, so answer A might be correct.\n"
