Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called the woman a \"cunt\" is in the wrong. The situation involves a person with health issues who tried to pick up a dropped item but couldn't because of their physical limitations. The other woman pushed past and made a dismissive comment, leading to the author using a harsh word.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has legitimate health problems that make physical tasks difficult. They were trying to help but couldn't because of their condition. The other woman's behavior was rude\u2014pushing past and mocking their excuse. The author's response was to call her a \"cunt,\" which is a strong and offensive term.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, using a swear word, especially one as harsh as \"cunt,\" is generally considered inappropriate in public and can be seen as confrontational. However, the context is important here. The author was in pain and felt disrespected. They might have been provoked by the other woman's unkind remarks. But even in provocation, responding with a derogatory term could escalate the situation and isn't a constructive response.\n\nOn the other hand, the other woman's behavior was inconsiderate and dismissive. She didn't acknowledge the author's limitations and made a judgment. The author's frustration is understandable given their health struggles and the added stress of the situation. However, the use of the word \"cunt\" is a clear violation of social norms and could be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the provocation.\n\nThe key point is whether the author's response was justified. While the provocation might mitigate some responsibility, the act itself is still inappropriate in a public setting. The author could have chosen a different, more respectful response, even if it was difficult. So, even though there's context, the use of such a strong insult likely makes the author at least partially at fault. However, some might argue that the other woman's actions were worse. But according to the question, it's about whether the author is in the wrong. Since they used an offensive term, the answer might be A. But I need to be careful here. The user's friend said they were an asshole, but the user disagrees. The community (AITA) usually considers the context. Maybe the answer is B, but I'm a bit torn. Let me think again.\n\nIn AITA threads, people often take into account both sides. The woman was rude, but the author's response was also inappropriate. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they used a swear word, even when provoked, they might be considered in the wrong. So answer A. But some might say B because the other woman was worse. But according to the question's options, it's a binary choice. I think the answer is A.\n"
