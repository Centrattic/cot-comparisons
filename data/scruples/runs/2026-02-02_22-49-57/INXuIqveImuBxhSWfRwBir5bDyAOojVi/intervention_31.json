Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in question is dealing with several health issues that make it difficult for them to bend down. While shopping, they see a dropped item and try to check if the person in front of them dropped it. The person says no, so the author can't pick it up because of their physical limitations. Then another woman pushes past and tells them to leave it, which leads to an argument. The woman accuses the author of making up excuses and calls them a \"lazy millennial.\" The author, in pain and frustrated, responds with a curse word.\n\nFirst, the author's intent was probably to be helpful but was physically unable. They did try to explain their situation but were met with hostility. The woman's actions started the conflict by pushing and making a derogatory comment. The author's response, while uncouth, comes from being provoked. However, using a derogatory term like \"cunt\" is still disrespectful regardless of the provocation. The author could have chosen a different response, even if they felt wronged. The key points are the provocation and the intent. The author might feel justified, but using such language is generally considered inappropriate. But the woman's initial behavior was also aggressive. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The author's response was a reaction to being insulted, but it's still a harsh word. However, given the context of their health issues and the other person starting the conflict, maybe they're not entirely at fault. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, because they were provoked and had a valid reason for their inability. But some might argue that using such a word is always wrong. The community might lean towards B here, considering the provocation and the health factors.\n"
