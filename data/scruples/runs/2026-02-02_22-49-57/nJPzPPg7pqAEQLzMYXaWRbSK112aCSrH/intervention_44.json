She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for asking his wife to give up her dangerous job. The author's wife works with venomous animals and had a near-death experience. He's worried about her safety and wants her to stop, but she's not willing to give up her passion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the husband is trying to protect his wife's life, which is understandable. No one wants their spouse to be in danger. He's been supportive before but now the situation escalated after the accident. His concern is valid; he's scared she might die. On the other hand, the wife has a dream job in a field she's passionate about. She's aware of the risks and compares it to other high-risk jobs like police or firefighters. She's contributed to her field and it's part of her identity.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is overstepping by asking her to quit. Marriage involves compromise, but so does respecting each other's autonomy. The wife's job is her own choice, and even though it's risky, she's making an active decision. The husband can express his fears but can't force her to quit. However, the emotional toll on him is real. They're in a stalemate, both not budging. \n\nIs he wrong for wanting her to stop? Maybe not, because his intention is to protect her. But he can't control her career choices. The real issue might be communication and finding a middle ground. Maybe they need to discuss how to manage the risks together, like safety protocols or emotional support, instead of one side giving up their job. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The husband isn't wrong for caring, but he might be wrong in expecting her to quit solely because of his anxiety. The wife is right in defending her career choice, but she should consider her husband's feelings. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values, but generally, forcing someone to quit a job isn't fair. So the husband isn't in the wrong for expressing his concerns, but he's not right in demanding she quit. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) but with nuances.\n"
