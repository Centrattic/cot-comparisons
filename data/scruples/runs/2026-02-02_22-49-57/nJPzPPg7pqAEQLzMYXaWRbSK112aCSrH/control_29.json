She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants his wife to give up her dangerous job working with venomous animals because he's worried about her safety. She's passionate about her work and refuses to quit. The question is whether he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is valid because his wife's job is risky. He's not just being paranoid; she almost died from a snake bite. His fear and stress are real emotions, and he's trying to protect her. On the other hand, the wife has a right to pursue her passion and career, especially if she's aware of the risks and willing to accept them. Her job could have significant positive impacts through her research.\n\nThe husband didn't force her to quit initially; he only asked after the incident. He's trying to communicate his feelings, which is important in a relationship. However, relationships require mutual respect and compromise. The wife's job is a major part of her identity and professional goals. Demanding she give it up might be overstepping, even if his intentions are good. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? It depends on how he's approaching the situation. If he's being controlling or dismissive of her feelings, then yes. But if he's expressing his concerns and they're having a discussion, it's a valid concern. The key is whether he's respecting her autonomy. The wife understands his concerns but disagrees. The husband might not be in the wrong for caring, but he might be if he's trying to control her choices. The problem is the conflict between his safety concerns and her right to her career. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the line is often drawn about whether someone's actions are infringing on another's rights or autonomy. Here, the husband is asking her to quit, which is a big decision. While his concern is genuine, it's important for him to respect her choice. The wife's career is her own, and unless there's a way to mitigate the risks without her quitting, he might not be in the wrong for expressing his wish, but he could be if he's pressuring her. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not forcing her and they're in conflict, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's voicing his concerns, even if they lead to a disagreement. But some might argue A because he's trying to control her career choice. Need to weigh the cultural context as well. In many cases, supporting a partner's career is expected, but safety is also important. The line is thin here. The husband isn't necessarily wrong for wanting her to quit for safety, but it's a tough spot. The answer could be B, as he's not in the wrong for having a valid concern, but the situation is complex. The wife's right to her career might be more important, but the husband's fear is also valid. The Reddit community often looks at autonomy and respect. If he's not being abusive or controlling, just concerned, then he's not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
