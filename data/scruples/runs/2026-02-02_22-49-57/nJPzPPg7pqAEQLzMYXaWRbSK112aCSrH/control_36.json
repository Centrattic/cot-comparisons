She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job.\n\nFirst, the wife is working in a high-risk field\u2014biomedical research with venomous animals. She was bitten and almost died, which is a serious incident. The husband is clearly concerned for her safety. He's been supportive in the past but now can't handle the stress. The wife argues that her work is her passion and she accepts the risks, similar to a police officer or firefighter.\n\nSo, the question is about whether his desire for her to quit is wrong. On one hand, he's worried about her safety and their relationship. On the other, she's pursuing her dream and her job has life-saving potential. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The husband's concern is valid\u2014he loves her and doesn't want her to get hurt. But is it his place to decide for her? She's an independent adult with her own career and passions. Even though the job is risky, she's aware and has chosen to accept those risks. The husband might be overstepping by demanding she quit, especially if she's not willing to compromise. \n\nHowever, the situation is complicated. They've tried to discuss it, but neither is budging. The wife might not be considering his feelings enough, and the husband might not be respecting her autonomy. The answer might depend on whether the husband is being controlling versus genuinely concerned. If he respects her choice but can't handle the stress, maybe they need to find another solution, like moving away from the job or other compromises. \n\nBut the key point is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's asking her to give up her career for safety, which she's already accepted, he might be in the wrong. However, the fact that he's trying to protect her could be seen as caring. It's a tough call, but maybe the answer is that he's not entirely wrong, but neither is he right. However, the system asks to choose between A (yes) or B (no). Considering she has autonomy and he's not forcing her but asking, maybe the answer is A. Wait, but if he's expressing concern without forcing, is he in the wrong? The wife might feel his concern is valid but his approach is wrong. Alternatively, if he's pressuring her, that's where the issue is. The question is whether he's in the wrong. In many such cases, the spouse's autonomy is key. So, the answer might be B (no), but I'm a bit conflicted. Wait, the husband is not in the wrong because he's expressing his feelings and concerns? Or is he wrong for trying to make her quit? The line is blurry. If he's not forcing her but just expressing his feelings, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's making it a deal-breaker and not respecting her choice, then he might be. The story says they've had fights and he's not budging. So, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he's trying to control her career choices. But then again, his concern is valid. Hmm.\n"
