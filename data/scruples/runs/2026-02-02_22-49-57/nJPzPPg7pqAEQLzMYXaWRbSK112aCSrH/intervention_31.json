She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dream job in the biomedical field, which involves working with venomous animals. The wife was bitten by a Gaboon viper and almost died, but she went back to work as soon as she could. The husband is now very worried and wants her to stop, while she feels it's unfair and her passion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is about his wife's safety. He loves her and is stressed because of the risks. On the other hand, the wife has worked hard for her career and believes the risks are part of her job, similar to other high-risk professions like police or firefighters. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and autonomy. The husband is asking her to quit because of his fears, which might be valid emotionally, but does he have the right to make that decision for her? The wife's perspective is that her career is important, and she's willing to accept the risks. It's a matter of whether one partner can override the other's professional choices based on personal anxiety.\n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's dreams is crucial. However, safety is also a significant factor. The husband didn't force her before, only after a serious incident. But even then, he's asking her to give up her career, which she might see as a lack of support. The wife's point about other high-risk jobs is interesting. If she were in a different field with similar risks, would he still feel the same? It might be that his concern is specific to her current job, but that's part of the problem.\n\nAlso, the fact that she went back to work after recovery shows her commitment. The husband might be projecting his fear, which is understandable, but he can't control her career choices. The wife's autonomy and her right to pursue her passion despite the risks are important. The husband's role is to support and communicate his fears, not to dictate her career. So, the husband might be overstepping by not respecting her choice, even if his intentions are good. The answer likely leans towards AITA being on the husband's side, so the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
