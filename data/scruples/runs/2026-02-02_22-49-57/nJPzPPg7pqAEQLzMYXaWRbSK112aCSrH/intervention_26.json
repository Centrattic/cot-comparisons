She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband wants his wife to quit her dangerous job working with venomous animals after she was bitten and almost died. The wife is passionate about her career and compares it to high-risk professions like police or firefighters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is understandable. He loves his wife and is terrified of her getting hurt again. His emotional response is natural when a loved one is in danger. On the other hand, the wife has worked hard for her career and sees it as her passion. She's taking calculated risks for the greater good of her research. \n\nIs it fair for the husband to ask her to quit? Well, he's not forcing her; he's expressing his feelings and concerns. He's made it clear how worried he is. But ultimately, the decision to continue the job is hers. The wife might feel that her autonomy is being challenged. However, the husband isn't trying to control her career; he's just expressing his fears and wanting her to consider safety. \n\nDoes wanting your spouse to quit a dangerous job make you a jerk? It depends. If the husband is respecting her choice and not coercing her, maybe not. But if he's pressuring her or being controlling, that's different. The post says they've hit a wall, and the wife finds his request unfair. So it's a conflict of values: personal safety vs. professional passion. \n\nThe key point is whether the husband has the right to ask her to stop. If the wife is an adult and making an informed choice about her job, the husband can't make her quit. However, his concern is valid. The question is whether his request is reasonable. Some people might think he's being selfish because he's prioritizing his anxiety over her career. Others might see him as protective, trying to save her life. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The husband isn't in the wrong for being worried, but he can't force her to stop. The wife isn't wrong for not giving up her job. They both have valid perspectives. The problem is that they can't find a middle ground. The husband might be in the wrong if he's being overbearing, but if he's just expressing his feelings without coercion, maybe not. \n\nThe answer probably leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's voicing his concerns without forcing her to quit. But others might argue he's being selfish. I need to decide based on the information given. Since he's not controlling her and just wants her to consider safety, and the wife is making her own choice, he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
