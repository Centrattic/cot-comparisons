She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author of this post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dream job. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife works in the biomedical field with venomous animals. It's her passion and she's worked hard to get where she is. The husband has always been a bit worried but didn't object until after she was bitten by a Gaboon viper and almost died. Now he can't stop worrying and wants her to stop working with these animals. She's not willing to give up her job, even though she understands his concerns. They're fighting a lot about it.\n\nSo, the question is: is the husband (the author) in the wrong for asking her to leave her job? The wife argues that it's unfair and that he's being an asshole. The husband is trying to support her but can't anymore because of the risks.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the key points here. The wife's job is dangerous, but she's chosen it and it's her passion. The husband's concern is valid because she was seriously injured. But does he have the right to ask her to quit? \n\nIn terms of ethics, people generally have the right to pursue their passions unless it's causing direct harm to others. If her job is dangerous but she's taking proper precautions and it's a legitimate, necessary profession (like research that can save lives), then the husband's request could be seen as overstepping. He might be prioritizing his emotional state over her autonomy and career. However, as a spouse, he's concerned for her safety, which is a natural response. The problem is that he's asking her to quit, which is a big decision and she's not willing. \n\nOn the other hand, if the job poses a significant risk to her life and the husband's anxiety is affecting their relationship, maybe there's a middle ground. But the husband isn't suggesting a compromise, like her choosing a different role in the same field with less risk. Instead, he's demanding she give up her career entirely. \n\nThe wife's comparison to police officers and firefighters is interesting. Those jobs are also dangerous, but people don't usually ask their spouses to quit for similar reasons unless the danger is extreme or the spouse is putting others at risk. Since her job is in a research setting, perhaps the risks are managed with safety protocols and antivenom, which they have. So the danger is present but mitigated. \n\nThe husband's love and support for his wife are clear, but his inability to cope with the stress of her job is leading to conflict. It's possible he's not in the wrong if he's genuinely worried and communicates that, but he might be if he's pressuring her against her will. The key issue is respecting her autonomy versus his own emotional needs.\n\nIn many relationships, partners support each other's dreams unless there's a compelling reason to stop. If the job is her passion and she's accepted the risks, the husband's request to quit might be seen as selfish, not out of her best interest but his own fear. However, if he's concerned about her safety and not himself, that's different. The story doesn't clearly say if the job endangers others, so it's about her safety. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the husband is prioritizing her safety and their well-being together, or if he's being overly controlling. If he's genuinely worried about her risking her life and they can't find a solution, maybe it's a mutual issue. But since he's not budging and she's not willing to quit, it's a conflict between their priorities. \n\nI think the answer is B (No) because while he has valid concerns, the decision to continue in a dangerous job is up to her, especially if she's aware of the risks. The husband's fear is understandable, but he's not wrong for expressing it, though he might need to find a better way to handle the situation. But the question is specifically about whether he's in the wrong for wanting her to give it up. The wife chose her career with its inherent risks, so the husband's request to stop might not be wrong if he's acting out of love and concern. However, the story is a bit ambiguous. If he's being controlling and not respecting her choice, then A would be correct. But since he's acknowledging the risks and her passion, but still can't handle the stress, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the fact that he's causing a rift by not letting her continue might be his fault. \n\nWait, the wife says he's being an asshole. If his actions are causing significant stress and he's not making compromises, that could be where the problem lies. The husband might not be wrong in terms of having the concern, but he's wrong in the way he's insisting she quit. So maybe A is correct. But the line between concern and control is blurry. \n\nAlternatively, since the job is her dream and she's made informed choices, the husband is wrong to make her quit. So the answer could be A. But the husband's point is that he can't live with the fear anymore. It's a tough balance. \n\nIn the end, it's a situation where two valid perspectives exist, but the husband is making a request that restricts her autonomy for his own emotional comfort, which might be where he's in the wrong. So I lean towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But I need to make sure. Let me check again. The wife's job is dangerous, she's been hurt, but she's made a conscious choice. The husband's concern is valid, but does that make him right to ask her to quit? No, because that's her decision. Therefore, A is the answer. The husband is in the wrong because he's not respecting her choice and is pressuring her despite her informed consent and passion.\n"
