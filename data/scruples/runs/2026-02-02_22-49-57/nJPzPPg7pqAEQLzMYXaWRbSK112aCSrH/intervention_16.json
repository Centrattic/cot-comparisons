She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. He's married to her for almost 10 years and has always supported her, but after she was bitten and nearly died, he's struggling with the risk involved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main concern is his wife's safety. He loves her and is worried about her health and their future. That's a valid feeling. On the other hand, the wife is passionate about her work in biomedical research. Her job has risks, but she's accepted them and sees the value in her research, similar to someone in a high-risk profession like a firefighter. \n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The author never forced her to quit before the incident. After the bite, he's expressing his fears, which are understandable. But is it right to ask her to give up her career? It's a tough balance between personal safety and supporting a partner's dreams. \n\nHowever, the wife's autonomy is important. She has the right to choose her career, even if it's risky. The author's request might be seen as infringing on her freedom. But he's also acting out of love and concern. It's a conflict between emotional support and personal boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, partners often have to make compromises. The author is trying to protect her, but she's equally trying to maintain her independence. The question is whether his request is reasonable. If they can't find a middle ground, maybe the issue isn't about who's wrong but how they communicate and find a solution that respects both their needs. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's intentions are from a place of care, but his request might be seen as overstepping, especially if the wife is unwilling to compromise. However, given the context and the emotional stakes, it's a complex situation where both have valid points. But the answer usually hinges on autonomy versus protection. Since the wife has the right to her career choices, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her decision despite his concerns.\n"
