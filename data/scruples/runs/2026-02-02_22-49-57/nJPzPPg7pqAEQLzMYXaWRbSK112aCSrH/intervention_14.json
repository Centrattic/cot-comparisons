She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife has a passion for her work in biomedical research involving venomous animals. She's pursued this career for a decade and it's clearly important to her. She even took a serious risk and almost died but chose to return to her job, indicating her dedication.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is deeply concerned about her safety. After her near-fatal incident, his anxiety is justified. He's tried to express his worries without pressuring her before, but now the situation has escalated. He's not asking her to quit entirely but to stop working with venomous animals, which is a significant part of her job. \n\nThe key points here are consent, mutual respect, and compromise. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's goals and safety. The husband's concern is valid because he loves her and wants her to be safe. However, the wife's autonomy and career aspirations are also important. The husband isn't forcing her to quit; he's expressing his feelings and asking her to consider his perspective. \n\nThe wife comparing her job to high-risk professions like police or firefighters is a valid point. People in those fields accept risks for the greater good. But the husband's fear is real and impacts their relationship. The question is whether his request is reasonable. \n\nIs it wrong to ask someone to leave a dangerous job? It depends on the context. If the job is illegal or harmful to others, then yes. But here, the job is legitimate and beneficial. The husband's motivation is love and concern, not control. However, the wife's right to make her own career choices is also a factor. \n\nThe husband isn't in the wrong because his intentions are to protect her, which is natural. But the wife isn't in the wrong either for pursuing her passion. The real issue is the lack of compromise and understanding. Both need to find a middle ground, maybe adjusting her role to reduce risk without completely abandoning her field. \n\nSo, considering all this, the husband isn't in the wrong. His concerns are valid, and he's trying to communicate them. However, the answer isn't black and white. But based on the scenario, the answer is B.\n"
