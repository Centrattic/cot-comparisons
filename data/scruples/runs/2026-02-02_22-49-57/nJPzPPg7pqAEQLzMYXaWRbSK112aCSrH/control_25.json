She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user wants to know if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for asking his wife to give up her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The wife works with venomous animals in the biomedical field, researching venom's medical applications. She's had a serious accident with a Gaboon viper, almost died, but the facility had antivenom. After recovery, she went back to work. The husband, who's always been concerned but didn't push before, is now deeply worried and has asked her to stop working with venomous animals. They're arguing because she sees it as her passion and compares the job to high-risk professions like police or firefighters. The husband can't accept the risk, even if it's part of her career.\n\nNow, the key points here are the husband's request, the wife's career choice, and the risk involved. The husband's actions are out of love and concern, as he mentions he can't handle the stress anymore and fears for her life. The wife is passionate about her job and has accepted the risks, which is understandable given her field. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is wrong to make this request. On one hand, he's prioritizing her safety, which is a common issue in relationships where partners have differing risk tolerances. On the other hand, the wife's autonomy and right to choose her career is a big factor. She's not forced to work there, and her job has a noble purpose. \n\nI should consider cultural norms and relationship dynamics. It's common for partners to have disagreements about such matters. However, pressuring someone to abandon their passion, even if it's risky, might be seen as overstepping. The husband mentions he's never objected before, only after the incident. The wife's comparison to police or firefighters is relevant because those jobs are also high-risk but valued by society. \n\nBut there's a difference between understanding the risk and actively trying to change her career. The husband's concern is valid, but is it his right to ask her to quit? It might depend on the nature of the relationship and how her job affects their life together. If her job is a personal passion and she's in a safe environment (with antivenom, proper training), then her choice is hers. However, if the husband's anxiety is causing significant marital stress, maybe they need to find a compromise, but that's not the same as him being in the wrong. \n\nThe wife's argument is that it's unfair for him to ask her to give up her dream, which is a strong point. People often balance risks in their careers, and her work could save lives. The husband's position is that he can't accept the risk, even if she does. It's a tough spot. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband is justified in making that request. Since the wife is in a legitimate career path with accepted risks, and the husband's concern is emotional but not necessarily rational (as the job has safety measures), the husband might be seen as the one being unreasonable. The wife has the right to make her own decisions about her career, especially if she's aware of the risks and the work is important to her. The husband's support is important, but it shouldn't override her autonomy if she's making an informed choice.\n"
