She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dream job. The situation is that his wife works with venomous animals, which poses a risk, and after an incident where she was bitten and almost died, he wants her to stop. She's against it because it's her passion and she feels it's comparable to other risky jobs like firefighters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's main concern is his wife's safety. He loves her and is worried about her getting hurt or dying. That's a valid emotional response. On the other hand, the wife has worked hard for her career, it's her passion, and she's aware of the risks. She's accepted those risks, similar to other high-risk professions.\n\nNow, the key points here are autonomy and mutual respect. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's choices and work together to find solutions that benefit both. The husband is expressing his fear and concern, which is understandable, but asking her to give up her career entirely might overstep if she's not willing. However, the wife's job does involve real risks that could affect their relationship dynamics and his well-being.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, wanting to protect her is natural, but he has to respect her autonomy. However, the fact that they've had multiple fights and neither is budging could indicate a communication issue rather than one person being wrong. The husband might be reasonable in his concern, but demanding she quit her job could be seen as controlling if he's not considering her feelings and career.\n\nBut the wife's job is her passion, and she's aware of the risks. The husband's request could be seen as infringing on her freedom. However, the husband's emotional distress is also real. The question is whether his concern is a valid reason to ask her to leave her job.\n\nIn some perspectives, the husband isn't wrong for caring about her safety, but he might need to find other ways to cope with the stress instead of demanding a career change. The wife, on the other hand, might need to acknowledge his fears and see if there's a compromise, like her moving to a less risky role within her field.\n\nUltimately, both have valid points. The husband's concern is genuine, but his solution (her quitting) might not be fair. The wife's right to her career is important. So, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because his intentions are from a place of love and concern, but the situation requires mutual understanding and compromise rather than one person being wrong.\n"
