She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research, which led to a life-threatening incident. He's supportive of her passion but now can't handle the stress and wants her to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is valid; he's worried about her safety and their relationship is suffering. On the other hand, the wife has a legitimate career that she's passionate about, and she's willing to accept the risks. She's also in a field where such risks are inherent, similar to other emergency responders.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong by asking her to quit. The key points are consent, mutual support in a relationship, and the balance between personal safety and career. In relationships, it's important to respect each other's autonomy unless there's a legal or ethical obligation. The husband isn't forcing her; he's expressing his feelings and concerns. The wife, however, is making the choice to continue her work despite the risks, which she's aware of.\n\nThe husband's request isn't about control but about his emotional well-being. However, it's her career and her life. The fact that they're at an impasse suggests that they might need to find a compromise, but the husband isn't in the wrong simply for caring about her safety. The wife's comparison to police or firefighters shows she understands the risks are part of the job. Still, the husband's feelings are real, and he's not wrong for seeking a solution that aligns with his comfort level.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's expressing his concerns, and while it's a difficult situation, he's not the one making demands but rather struggling with his own fears. The real issue is whether they can find a middle ground, but he isn't at fault for wanting her to be safe.\n"
