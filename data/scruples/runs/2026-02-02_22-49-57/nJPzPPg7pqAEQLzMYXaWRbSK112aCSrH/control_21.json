She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her job. The situation is complicated because the wife works with venomous animals and has faced life-threatening situations. The author supports her passion but now wants her to stop due to safety concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's concern is legitimate because his wife's job is dangerous, and he's been through a traumatic experience when she was bitten. He's worried for her safety and their future. On the other hand, the wife has worked hard for her dream job in a field she's passionate about. She sees her work as important and similar to other high-risk jobs like police or firefighters. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect in a relationship and balancing personal safety with professional aspirations. The author is asking her to give up her career for his peace of mind, which could be seen as infringing on her autonomy. However, his intention is to protect her, which is a natural concern for a spouse. \n\nBut relationships require negotiation. If both parties are at an impasse, maybe there's a middle ground. For example, the wife could take additional safety measures, or they could work on counseling to find a compromise. The author isn't forcing her to quit, just expressing his feelings and concerns. However, the fact that he's unyielding and causing stress might be problematic. It's possible that his stance is overstepping, especially since he acknowledges her passion and the importance of her work but still can't support her. \n\nIn many cases, supporting a partner's career is expected unless there are extreme circumstances. Since the wife's job isn't illegal or unethical, and she's taking necessary precautions, the author's demand to quit could be seen as restrictive. However, his fear is valid after the incident. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is respecting her autonomy versus his safety concerns. Since he's not using coercion but is emotionally challenging the relationship if she doesn't comply, it's a gray area. But given that he's trying to express his feelings and she's trying to pursue her dream, the author might be in the wrong for not finding a compromise or respecting her choice despite his fears.\n"
