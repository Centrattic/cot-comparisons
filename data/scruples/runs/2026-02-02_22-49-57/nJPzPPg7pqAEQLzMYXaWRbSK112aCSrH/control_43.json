She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The situation is that the wife works with venomous animals, which poses a risk, and after a serious incident, the husband can't bear the stress anymore and wants her to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband loves his wife and supports her, but the job is causing him extreme anxiety. He's not stopping her directly but is asking her to quit for her safety. The wife, on the other hand, is passionate about her career and sees it as important work that can save lives. She's not a police officer or firefighter, but the husband compares the risks.\n\nI should think about the balance between personal autonomy and concern for safety. The wife has a right to pursue her career if it's her passion, even if it's risky. However, the husband's feelings and fear are valid. He's not forcing her, just expressing his concerns. The question is whether his request is reasonable.\n\nIn relationships, partners often have to make compromises. But demanding someone to give up their dream job due to fear might be too much. It's possible that the husband is overstepping because he's projecting his anxiety onto her. However, his concern for her safety is genuine. \n\nThe key points are: the wife's job is risky but she's aware and chose it. The husband isn't trying to control her but is struggling with the emotional toll. The wife isn't budging, and he's not either. The question is if he's wrong to ask her to quit. \n\nI need to check if there's any legal or ethical obligation for him to let her work. Probably not, but ethically, respecting her autonomy is important. So the answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B), but that he's struggling with a difficult situation. However, some might argue that he's in the wrong because he's not respecting her career choice. \n\nAnother angle: the husband's anxiety is affecting their relationship, and maybe he should seek support for his fears rather than asking her to quit. If she's taking appropriate safety measures, the risk might be manageable. The husband's request might be irrational because he's not accepting the inherent risks of her job. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer could be B (he's not in the wrong) because he's expressing valid concerns for her safety, but others might see it as A (he's in the wrong) because it's her right to take the risk. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not forcing her and is just expressing his feelings, maybe he's not wrong. So, B.\n"
