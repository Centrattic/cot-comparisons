She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals and was bitten, almost dying. The husband is worried and can't stop being stressed, leading to fights. The user thinks the husband isn't wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is valid because his wife's job is objectively dangerous. He loves her and wants her safe. On the other hand, the wife has a passion for her work, which has potential to save lives. She's already accepted the risks, and the husband didn't force her before. Now, after a serious incident, he's asking her to quit. That's a big shift. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The husband expressed his worries, but it's her choice. Even if he's worried, she has the right to make her own career decisions. However, the fact that she's a decade into the marriage and he's just now becoming more insistent might matter. Did he have prior knowledge and never pushed before? The wife was bitten, so the situation has escalated. \n\nBut is it fair for him to ask her to quit? It's a matter of perspective. If the job is her passion and she's aware of the risks, the husband's request could be seen as overstepping, even if his intentions are good. Marriage involves compromise, but does a spouse have the right to demand another to leave their chosen career? The wife might feel that her autonomy is being threatened. \n\nThe husband's comparison to police or firefighters is interesting. Those jobs are also risky, but society generally accepts them. If the husband would be okay with her being a firefighter, but not with her current job, maybe there's a double standard. Or perhaps the difference is the perceived risk and the nature of the job. \n\nIn the end, the husband's feelings are real and important, but the wife's right to pursue her career should also be respected. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" emotionally, but from a standpoint of respecting her agency, maybe he is. However, the post asks if he's in the wrong for wanting her to give it up. Since it's her choice, the answer is probably B, but I'm not 100% sure.\n"
