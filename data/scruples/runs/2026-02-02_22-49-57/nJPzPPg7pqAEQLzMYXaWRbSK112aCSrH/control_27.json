She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dream job because it's dangerous. They've been married almost 10 years, and the wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper, almost died, but went back to work quickly. Now the husband can't handle the stress and wants her to stop working with these animals, while she refuses, saying it's her passion and that she's saving lives, like a police officer or firefighter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's main concern is his wife's safety. He's worried about her getting hurt or dying, which is understandable, especially after a traumatic event. It's natural for a spouse to want to protect the other. He's expressed his concerns and even tried to support her before the incident but now feels the stress is too much. His request is coming from a place of fear and love, but it's about her career choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife has a passion for her work and a desire to contribute to medical research. Her job is a dream she worked hard for. She's in a dangerous field, but she's aware of the risks and takes precautions. The husband's argument is that he would feel the same if she were a police officer or firefighter, but those are typically seen as more socially accepted high-risk professions. The fact that she's in a field that could lead to her death is a key point here. \n\nNow, if the wife chose a high-risk job like a firefighter, the husband might feel the same anxiety, but society generally respects those roles for their public service. Similarly, someone might have a different view on a biomedical researcher working with venomous animals. The question is whether the husband has a right to ask her to quit, even if he's not in the wrong for being concerned. \n\nThe husband isn't forcing her; he's asking, which implies he's not being coercive. However, the wife has the right to pursue her career as long as it's legal and she's making an informed choice. The problem arises when the husband's request is based on his personal fear rather than objective danger. If her job is a legitimate and accepted part of her field, and she's taking proper safety measures, then the husband's desire for her to quit might be infringing on her autonomy. \n\nAnother angle: the husband is struggling with his own anxiety and the stress is affecting their relationship. Maybe he needs to address his emotional issues rather than trying to change her career. If he's not willing to support her, but she's still committed, then he might be the one creating a rift. The wife's right to her career versus the husband's right to not be anxious is a balance here. \n\nBut is the husband being irrational? If the job's risks are inherent to the work and she's in a field that's necessary for research, it's a matter of personal choice. The husband can't control her career decisions. So, the author might not be in the wrong for feeling concerned, but he could be in the wrong if he's pressuring her to quit a valid and fulfilling job just because he's uncomfortable with the risk. \n\nLooking at similar situations, like if a spouse is a pilot or a paramedic, the partner might have similar concerns. However, the decision to change careers is a big one, and unless the job is illegal or the risks are unreasonably high without justification, the spouse's autonomy is key. The author's stance is about safety, but if the wife's job is within standard safety protocols, then maybe the author is in the wrong for not accepting her choice despite his fears. \n\nThe wife's argument is that it's unfair and asshole-ish of him. The husband's justification is that he wants to protect her, but that could be seen as overstepping if she's already made an informed choice about the risks. The author might be in the wrong because he's trying to control her career based on his emotional response rather than rational, objective danger. However, it's also possible that the husband isn't in the wrong if the risks are too much for their relationship. But given the way the question is framed, the community would likely value personal autonomy and the wife's right to her career unless there's a significant ethical or legal issue. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong. He's not being supportive of her career and is pressuring her to give up her passion based on his anxiety. However, if the job is extremely dangerous beyond normal professional risks, but the user didn't mention that. The wife's role is in a biomedical field with dangerous animals, which is a known risk in her field, so it's her choice. The husband's problem is his emotional state, which he should address, not necessarily her job.\n"
