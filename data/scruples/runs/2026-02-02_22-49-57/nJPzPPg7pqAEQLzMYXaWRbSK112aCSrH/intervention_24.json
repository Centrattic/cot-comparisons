She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author's wife works with venomous animals in a biomedical field, researching venom for medical purposes. She recently got bitten by a Gaboon viper, almost died, and now the author wants her to stop working with these animals. They've had a lot of fights about it, and the wife thinks he's being unfair by asking her to give up her dream job. The author is torn between supporting her passion and his fear for her safety.\n\nHmm. The first thing to consider is whether the author is overstepping by asking her to quit. On one hand, he's worried about her safety, which is understandable, especially after a life-threatening incident. But on the other hand, she has a choice in her career and has accepted the risks involved, similar to someone in a high-risk profession like firefighting. \n\nThe wife's perspective is important. She sees her work as meaningful and has a passion for it. It's her dream job, and she's worked hard to get there. The author's request could be seen as undermining her autonomy and career goals. However, the author's concern is genuine and stems from love and fear of losing her. \n\nBut in a relationship, where is the line drawn? Supporting each other's dreams is a key part of a partnership. The author has always supported her before, only starting to push back after the incident. The wife's job does have inherent risks, but she's in a controlled environment with antivenom available. Maybe the author is now overreacting, or is his fear justified? \n\nAlso, the wife went back to work as soon as she could. That shows her commitment, but maybe the author feels that the danger is too high now. The question is whether his request is reasonable. The wife's job does have risks, but if she's in a role that's crucial for her happiness and the facility takes safety seriously, then maybe the author is being too controlling. \n\nHowever, if the risks are high and the author's anxiety is affecting their relationship, perhaps they need to find a middle ground. The author might need to accept that she can't quit, but maybe she can take more precautions. The problem is the author is asking her to give up the job entirely, which she's unwilling to do. \n\nSo, the author's position is based on fear and a desire to protect, but the wife's autonomy and career choice are also important. It's possible that the author is not in the wrong for expressing concern, but he might be in the wrong for demanding she give up her job. The key is that the wife is making an informed choice, and the author has to respect her decision, even if he's scared. \n\nBut there's a balance. If the job is putting her life at risk repeatedly, is it reasonable for the partner to have a say? However, unless there's a specific, ongoing danger that the workplace isn't addressing, it's up to her to manage her own risks. The author might need to find a way to cope with his anxiety without trying to control her career. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether his request is a matter of concern or overstepping. The wife's job is her choice, and while the author's feelings are valid, he might be the one being unreasonable here. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong (A) for not respecting her autonomy and career, but if the author is supporting her in other ways and just has a hard time coping, maybe not (B). \n\nWait, the wife's job is dangerous but she's in a facility with antivenom. So the risk is managed. The author's fear is emotional but perhaps not justified by the actual safety measures. So, the author is in the wrong because he's asking her to quit despite her informed decision and the safety precautions in place. So the answer would be A.\n"
