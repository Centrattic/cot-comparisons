She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals and was bitten, leading to a serious injury. The husband is worried about her safety and wants her to stop, but she's passionate about her work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is valid because he loves her and wants her to be safe. His fear after the snake bite makes sense. On the other hand, the wife has a passion for her job and sees it as important research that can save lives. She might feel that her career is a significant part of her identity.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong by asking her to give up her job. Legally, he can't force her to quit. Ethically, it's about balancing his fears with her autonomy and career. The husband is expressing his feelings but doesn't seem to be using coercion. However, he's causing stress in their relationship by not accepting her choice. \n\nThe wife's argument is that her job is her dream, and she accepts the risks. Comparing her work to police or firefighters is a point in her favor, as those jobs are also risky but accepted in society. The husband's stance might be seen as overstepping if he's pressuring her without considering her autonomy. However, his intentions are protective. \n\nIt's a tough balance. The husband isn't forcing her, but he's causing conflict. The answer might hinge on whether his actions are seen as unreasonable. If he's supporting her but can't handle the stress, maybe he's not the jerk but needs to find a middle ground. However, if he's pressuring her to quit against her will, that's different. The key is that he hasn't forced her to quit yet; he's just arguing and it's causing rifts. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the wife is the one making the career choice, and the husband's role is to support her while managing his own anxiety. If he's not being abusive or controlling, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's making her feel guilty or forcing her hand, then yes. The post doesn't mention coercion, just that they're stuck in arguments. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because he's expressing his legitimate concerns and hasn't forced her to quit. However, some might argue he's being selfish by not supporting her dream. The Reddit community often leans towards respecting personal autonomy, so maybe the husband is seen as not the jerk but in a tough spot. Final answer B.\n"
