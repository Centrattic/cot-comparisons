She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The author is a husband who wants his wife to give up her dangerous job in biomedical research involving venomous animals. They've been married almost a decade, and the wife was bitten by a snake recently, which caused a rift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband loves his wife and supports her, but her job poses serious risks. After a life-threatening incident, he's worried and wants her to stop working with venomous animals. He's not asking her to quit entirely but just the dangerous part. However, she sees it as him trying to take away her dream and passion. She compares her job to police or firefighters, who also take risks but are respected for their contributions to society.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and safety. The wife has the right to pursue her career and make her own choices about risks. On the other hand, the husband's concern is valid because he's worried about her safety. But does that justify him asking her to give up her job? In a healthy relationship, respect for each other's autonomy is crucial. Even if he's worried, he can't control her career choices. However, his emotional response is understandable given the danger she faces.\n\nLegally and ethically, the wife is an adult and has the right to take risks in her career. The husband isn't responsible for her safety beyond expressing his concerns. So pushing her to quit might be infringing on her autonomy. However, their communication seems strained. Maybe they need to find a middle ground, like her taking more safety precautions or the husband finding ways to cope with his anxiety without pressuring her to quit.\n\nIn relationships, partners should support each other's goals unless there are other factors, like financial dependency or other non-negotiables. Here, the husband's issue is solely about her safety. But if she's willing to take the risk for her passion, he might need to accept that, even if it's hard. He's not the one in the wrong if he's honest about his feelings and respects her decision, but if he's pressuring her to quit against her will, that's where he might be wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong) because his concern is valid, but he's also within his rights to express his worries. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting her to quit. Since he's expressing a concern based on love and fear, not controlling behavior, maybe he's not the jerk. But some might argue he's overstepping. But given the context, B seems correct.\n"
