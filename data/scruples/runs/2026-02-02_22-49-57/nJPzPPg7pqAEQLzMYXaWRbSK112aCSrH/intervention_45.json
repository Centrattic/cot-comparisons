She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user says they want their wife to quit her dangerous job because she works with venomous animals and has already been bitten. The wife is passionate about her work and refuses to give it up, comparing it to high-risk jobs like police officers or firefighters. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is worried about his wife's safety and well-being, which is a natural concern for any partner. The wife, on the other hand, has a career she's worked hard for and sees the value in her research. \n\nThe user argues that he's not in the wrong because he's trying to protect her. But is it fair for him to ask her to give up her dream? The wife's job does involve risks, but she's aware of them and has accepted them. Comparing it to other professions that are considered socially acceptable despite their dangers might be a point in her favor. \n\nHowever, the author's fear is valid after the near-death experience. The emotional toll on him is significant, leading to stress and relationship issues. The key question is whether one partner can ethically ask the other to abandon their career for safety reasons, even if it's a high-risk job. \n\nI should also think about autonomy and mutual respect in a relationship. The wife has the right to pursue her passion unless there's a legal or ethical obligation to prevent her from doing so. The author's request could be seen as infringing on her autonomy, but his concern for her safety is genuine. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, he's trying to protect his spouse. On the other, he's asking her to sacrifice her career. The fact that she's already been injured might tip the scales. But maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he's voicing his concerns and trying to find a solution. However, the answer could depend on whether there's a middle ground, like her taking safety precautions or transitioning to a safer role within her field. \n\nIn the end, it might come down to whether one person's safety concerns can override another's career aspirations. The wife's analogy to other high-risk jobs suggests that such risks are sometimes accepted in the pursuit of greater good. The author's position could be seen as unreasonable if it's not based on actual legal or physical threats but rather his personal fear. Therefore, maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's autonomy and her right to choose her career despite the risks.\n"
