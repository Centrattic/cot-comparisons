She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. So, first, I need to understand both sides here.\n\nThe wife has a job in biomedical research involving venomous animals. She got bitten and almost died, but she's passionate about her work and wants to continue. The husband loves her and is terrified for her safety, leading him to ask her to quit. They're arguing about this, and he's seeking validation on Reddit.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's wrong. Let me break it down. On one hand, the husband's concern is valid. He loves her and wants to protect her from danger. It's natural for someone to fear losing their partner. On the other hand, the wife's job is her passion and career. She's in a field that contributes to science and can save lives, similar to high-risk professions like police or firefighters. She's aware of the risks and chose this path, which is her personal choice.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy versus safety. The wife has the right to make her own career choices, even if they involve risks. The husband isn't forcing her to take the risks but is asking her to leave the job altogether. However, he's not the one taking the risk; she is. It's her life and career, so her autonomy might be more important here. \n\nBut then again, the husband's emotional distress is real. He's terrified and it's causing strain in their marriage. But does that give him the right to ask her to quit? Maybe not. Respecting her choice, even if it's hard for him, might be necessary. However, it's also possible that he's justified in his concern, especially after a near-death experience. The balance between supporting her dreams and protecting her safety is tricky.\n\nIn similar situations, like someone in a high-risk job, partners often have to find a compromise. Maybe the husband needs to work on his anxiety while respecting her decision. If he can't accept her choice, it might be a problem for their relationship, but that's different from being in the wrong. The question is about whether he's wrong to want her to quit. Since she's an adult and has the right to her career, he's not in the wrong for being concerned, but he might be overstepping by demanding she leave her job. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because he's not wrong for having concerns, but he's in a difficult position. However, some might argue that A (Yes) is correct because he's infringing on her autonomy. But given that the wife is making the choice to stay in the job despite the risks, the husband's request might be seen as unreasonable. But then again, if he's her spouse, he has a stake in her safety. It's a tough call. However, the fact that she's aware of the risks and continues voluntarily suggests that the husband's position isn't necessarily wrong, but it's a conflict of values. The Reddit community would likely say that he's not the jerk because he's acting from love and concern, even if it's hard. So the answer is B.\n"
