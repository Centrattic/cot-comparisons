She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the wife works with venomous animals, which she's passionate about. She's in biomedical research, which is important for medical advancements. The husband loves her and supports her in general, but after she was bitten and almost died, he's really worried. He's not asking her to quit entirely but to stop working with venomous animals. She refuses, saying it's her passion and comparing it to high-risk jobs like firefighters.\n\nThe husband's main issue is fear for her safety. He's been stressed and it's causing marital problems. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, he's concerned about her safety, which is a valid concern. He's not forcing her but asking her to consider her health. On the other hand, he's asking her to give up a career she loves, which could be seen as controlling. The wife has the right to choose her career, even with risks. \n\nBut the husband's fear is real and affecting their relationship. However, his solution is for her to stop part of her job, which is significant. Maybe there's a middle ground, like her working in a different role within the field without handling the animals. \n\nIs he overstepping? Well, he's expressing his feelings and concerns, which is okay. But if he's pressuring her to change her career against her will, that's where it gets complicated. The key is whether his request is reasonable. Since her job is high-risk, but she's aware and willing to take the risk, he might not be in the wrong for wanting her to stop. However, he's not the one taking the risk, so his perspective might not fully align with hers. \n\nBut he's trying to protect her, which is a natural instinct. However, respecting her autonomy is also important. So maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong because he's acting out of love and concern, but the situation is complex. The real issue is communication and finding a compromise. Since he's not forcing her and just expressing his feelings, perhaps he's not the jerk here.\n"
