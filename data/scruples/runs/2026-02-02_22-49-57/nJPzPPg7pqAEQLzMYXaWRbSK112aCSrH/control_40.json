She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe main issue is that the husband is asking his wife to give up her dream job in the biomedical field, specifically working with dangerous animals like venomous snakes. She was recently bitten by a Gaboon viper, which almost killed her. He's been worried sick since then and wants her to stop working with those animals. She argues that it's her passion and that the risks are part of her job, similar to police officers or firefighters. They've had fights about it, and he's unsure if he's being irrational.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's concern is about his wife's safety and health. His fear is understandable after she nearly died. He loves her and wants the best for her, so his motivation isn't malicious. On the other hand, the wife has worked hard for her career and is passionate about her work, which contributes to saving lives through her research. She's willing to accept the risks because her job has a higher purpose.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong by asking her to leave her job. Legally, he can't force her to quit, so it's more about the moral aspect. The husband is expressing his feelings and concerns, but is it right to pressure her to give up her career? \n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's goals and dreams is important. The wife's job is a significant part of her identity and passion. However, the husband's feelings of fear and anxiety are real and valid. The challenge is balancing personal safety with supporting a partner's career aspirations.\n\nBut does wanting someone to be safe make the husband wrong? It's a tough call. He's not forcing her, just asking. The wife is an adult and can make her own decisions. The husband's request is about his emotional well-being and concern for her life. However, the wife's autonomy and her right to pursue her career should also be respected. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes the line is between concern and overstepping. If the husband is being overbearing or disrespectful of her choices, that would be wrong. But if he's expressing genuine concern and trying to communicate, maybe it's a matter of disagreement rather than him being in the wrong. The wife is also aware of the risks and has chosen to accept them. \n\nI need to consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe they could find a compromise, like her moving to a less dangerous role at the same facility or taking more safety precautions. But the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for not compromising and instead asking her to quit. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. If the husband is respectful and not coercive, he's not necessarily in the wrong. But if he's making her feel guilty or not respecting her autonomy, then he might be. The wife's reaction, calling him an asshole, suggests she feels he's overstepping. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? It's a tricky situation. His concern is valid, but so is the wife's right to her career. If he's pressuring her without considering her perspective, maybe he is. But if he's just sharing his feelings and trying to find a solution, then it's a difference in priorities. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband is being supportive despite his fears or if he's making her choose between her career and their relationship. Since he says he loves her and wants to support her, but is struggling, it's more about personal feelings. The wife is an adult, so he can't be in the wrong for having those feelings. The real issue is whether he's respecting her autonomy. Since he's asking her to quit, maybe he's overstepping, but if he's not coercing her, it's more about their differing values. \n\nIn AITA contexts, usually the person is in the wrong if they are being selfish or disrespectful. Here, the husband is expressing fear and love, but the wife's career is her choice. The husband might not be in the wrong, but the situation is complex. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to support her but struggling with his fears, and the wife is an adult who can make her own decisions.\n"
