She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dream job because of the risks involved. The post describes a situation where the wife works with venomous animals, had a near-death experience, and the husband is now deeply worried for her safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The husband supports her passion but is now struggling after a dangerous incident. He's not asking her to quit entirely but to stop working with venomous animals. The wife sees her job as a noble profession, comparing it to police or firefighters. The husband feels it's too risky, even if he acknowledges the value of her work.\n\nSo, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Factors to consider: consent and mutual respect in a relationship, the nature of the job's risks, and whether his request is overstepping. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's goals and boundaries. The husband has expressed concerns, but initially supported her. However, after a traumatic event, his anxiety has escalated. It's important to note that while his feelings are valid, pressuring her to quit a job she loves against her will could be seen as controlling. \n\nThe wife's argument is that she accepts the risks of her job, which is a common aspect of certain professions. The husband's analogy to police/firefighters is interesting because those jobs are high-risk, and society generally respects that. If he would accept her being a firefighter, maybe he's being inconsistent here. \n\nBut the key is whether his request is unreasonable. He's not asking her to stop her entire career, just the dangerous part. However, the job's dangerous aspect might be integral to her role. If she can't do that part, maybe she can't continue the job. But the husband is asking her to make a significant life change based on his fears, even if she's willing to accept the risks.\n\nOn the other hand, his concern is genuine. After a near-death experience, his anxiety is understandable. The relationship is strained because of this disagreement. The question is about right or wrong. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at intent and fairness. If the husband is prioritizing his own fears over her career and passion without a valid reason, he might be seen as the asshole. However, if he's genuinely trying to protect her and they're both at an impasse, it's a complex situation. \n\nBut in the context of personal agency and mutual respect, the wife has the right to choose her career, even with risks. The husband's request could be seen as overstepping if he's not willing to accept her decision. So, the answer might be that the husband is in the wrong (A) because he's trying to control her career choice based on his anxiety, even though his intentions are protective. However, if the job is extremely dangerous and the husband's fears are legitimate, perhaps it's a nuanced case. \n\nBut given the context provided, the more likely AITA answer is that the husband is in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy and professional choice, even if his concerns are valid. So, the answer would be A.\n"
