She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The author is a husband who wants his wife to quit her dangerous job in biomedical research with venomous animals. His wife almost died from a snake bite and he's really worried. They're having arguments about it.\n\nHmm, on one hand, the husband clearly loves his wife and is concerned for her safety. He's not asking her to give up her job out of selfishness, but because he's terrified she might get hurt again. On the other hand, the wife has a passion for her work and sees it as a noble cause, similar to firefighters or police. She's worked hard to get there and doesn't want to give it up. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect in a relationship. The husband is expressing his fears and concerns, which is valid. But does that mean he's in the wrong for wanting her to quit? Well, he hasn't forced her; he's just asking her to consider his feelings. However, he might be overlooking her autonomy and her right to make her own career choices, even with risks involved. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's goals unless there are more extreme circumstances. The husband's fear is real, but the wife's career is her choice. It's a tough balance. The fact that they can't reach a compromise is causing a rift. The question is whether his request is overstepping. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because he's coming from a place of love and concern. However, it's possible that he's not respecting her autonomy enough. But given that he's made his stance clear and she's not budging, he's trying to communicate his needs. The answer depends on how one views the balance between safety and personal freedom. Since he's not forcing her and is just expressing his feelings, maybe he's not the jerk. So I'm leaning towards B, the author is not in the wrong. But this is a nuanced situation where both have valid points.\n"
