She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The wife is passionate about her work in biomedical research with venomous animals. She's been doing this for a while and has a strong dedication. She returned to work after a serious injury, showing her commitment. Her job does have risks, like the viper bite incident, which nearly killed her.\n\nThe husband loves and supports her, but he's now extremely worried about her safety. He's not asked her to quit before, but after the incident, he can't handle the stress anymore and wants her to stop. He's stuck in a conflict where he can't accept the risk, even though he acknowledges her passion.\n\nNow, is the husband wrong? On one hand, he's concerned for her safety, which is a valid reason for a spouse. But he's essentially asking her to give up her career and passion. That's a big sacrifice. People have different thresholds for risk. The wife sees her job as important and comparable to high-risk jobs like firefighters, which society generally respects. The husband's reaction might be seen as overstepping if he's not allowing her autonomy in choosing her career, even if it's risky. However, he's also not forcing her, just expressing his wishes. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIf the wife is willing to accept the risks and the husband is causing her to feel pressured to change her career path, that could be problematic. However, if the husband is expressing his concerns without controlling her, it's a matter of differing priorities. The key is whether he's being controlling or just expressing his feelings. The story says he's asked her to stop, but she's not budging. The wife's argument is that it's unfair, and he's questioning if he's the jerk. \n\nIn such cases, it's about mutual respect. He has a right to his feelings, but she has the right to her career. The husband shouldn't force her, but his concern is understandable. The answer might hinge on whether he's being overbearing. Since he's not threatening or controlling but just expressing his stance, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, asking someone to give up their passion is a big ask. \n\nI think the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he's trying to control her career choices based on his fears, even though she's accepting the risks. Alternatively, B if it's seen as a valid concern. But the fact that she's in a high-risk job by choice and he's not respecting her autonomy might tilt towards A. But some might say he's just trying to protect her. Hmm. \n\nAnother angle: the wife's job is a significant part of her identity and career. If the husband is causing her to give it up due to his anxiety, that could be seen as selfish. However, if he's genuinely afraid for her safety and they can't find a middle ground, maybe it's a mutual issue. The key is whether he's being controlling. The story says they're stuck, and he's not budging. So he's being firm in his demand, which might be the problem. So A.\n"
