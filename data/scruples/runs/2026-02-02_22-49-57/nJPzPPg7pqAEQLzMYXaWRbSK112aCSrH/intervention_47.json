She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether he's being unreasonable by asking his wife to give up her dream job because it's dangerous. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the wife has been working in a high-risk field for a while, and she's really passionate about it. She's achieved a lot in the biomedical field with venomous animals. Then she had a serious incident where she was bitten by a Gaboon viper, which was life-threatening. The husband has always been uneasy but never outright opposed it before. Now, after the incident, he's really struggling with the risk, causing stress in their relationship. The wife sees the husband as being unfair and an asshole for making her choose between her job and their marriage.\n\nSo the husband's main argument is about wanting her to stop because of the danger. The wife argues that her job is her passion and she accepts the risks, similar to a police officer or firefighter. The husband disagrees and can't accept the risk, hence the conflict.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, a spouse's safety is a valid concern. The husband is worried about her life, which is understandable. He's not asking her to quit out of spite but because he's terrified of losing her. On the other hand, the wife has worked hard to reach her position and sees her job as meaningful. She's accepted the risks as part of her profession. The husband's request might infringe on her autonomy and career choices.\n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's goals is important. But when safety is a concern, especially after a near-death experience, it's a heavy issue. The husband is in a tough spot, trying to protect her, but she feels he's undermining her. The question is whether his request is reasonable or if he's overstepping.\n\nLegally, there's no issue, but morally and emotionally, it's complex. Some might say that a spouse's safety is paramount, so the husband isn't at fault for not wanting his wife to take risks that could end her life. Others might argue that he's being controlling and not respecting her career and autonomy. The wife's choice to continue in a dangerous job might be her personal risk she's willing to take, and the husband can't dictate that for her.\n\nI think it's a tough call. Both have valid points. The husband's fear is real, and the wife's career is important to her. However, the husband is asking her to give up her dream for his peace of mind, which could be seen as self-centered. But it's also a matter of how they balance personal safety against professional aspirations. \n\nThe key here is whether the husband's request is reasonable. If the job is inherently risky and she's aware of it, can he really make that decision for her? Maybe not. However, after a traumatic event like almost dying, it's natural to want to protect her. But pushing her to quit might not be the right approach. They might need to find a compromise, like her finding a safer role within the same field or the husband finding ways to cope with the stress instead of demanding she quit.\n\nSo, in terms of the question: Is the author in the wrong? If the answer is B (No), then it's because his concerns are valid and he's acting out of love. If A (Yes), then it's because he's not respecting her autonomy. I'm leaning towards B because the husband isn't forcing her; he's expressing his concerns and it's her choice. But he needs to communicate better and find a middle ground. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's expressing a valid concern for her safety, even if it's causing conflict, he's not necessarily wrong. The problem is more about the couple's differing priorities rather than one being clearly at fault.\n"
