She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research and was bitten by a Gaboon viper. The husband is worried about her safety and has asked her to stop, but she's not budging.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband loves his wife and his main concern is her safety. He's been supportive but now his anxiety is causing a rift. On the other hand, the wife has a passion for her work, which is contributing to medical research. She sees the risks as part of her job, similar to other high-risk professions like firefighters or police. She's already had a serious incident but wants to continue.\n\nI should think about the nature of their relationship. A decade together and married for half that time. They've had fights, and now it's a major conflict. The husband is worried about her health and possibly their future if something happens. But he's not asking her to leave her job entirely, just to stop working with venomous animals. However, maybe that's impossible if it's central to her role. \n\nThe wife's perspective is important. Her job is her passion and contributes to saving lives. She might feel that her husband isn't respecting her choices and autonomy. The husband might be overstepping by pressuring her to change her career, especially if she's aware of the risks and willing to accept them. \n\nAlso, consider if the husband is being irrational. He's been worried after a near-death incident, which is understandable. But is it his place to dictate her career? The wife's autonomy and right to pursue her dreams versus the husband's concern for her safety. There's a balance here. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. If the husband can't manage his anxiety, maybe he needs to seek support or counseling. The wife might need to consider if her job's risks are worth it, but if she's already accepted them, the husband's request might be unrealistic. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's not respecting her choices and autonomy, then yes, he's being a jerk. But if he's genuinely worried for her safety, maybe not entirely in the wrong. But in a healthy relationship, you support each other's choices unless there's a legal or ethical issue. Since she's aware of the risks and it's a valid career path, the husband's request might be overstepping. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's asking her to give up her passion based on his anxiety, not because her job is unethical or illegal. However, if the job is unnecessary risk beyond what's acceptable, maybe not. But the wife's job is part of her identity and she's accepted the risks. So, the husband's stance could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy.\n"
