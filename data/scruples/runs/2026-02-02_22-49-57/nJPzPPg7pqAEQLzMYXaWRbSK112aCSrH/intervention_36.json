She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The husband is asking if he's the asshole for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research, which led to a serious incident where she was bitten and nearly died. He's scared and wants her to stop, but she's passionate about her work and won't budge. They're fighting a lot over it.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The husband's main concern is his wife's safety. He loves her and is terrified of her getting hurt again. That's a valid emotional response. He's not forcing her to quit, but he's expressing his desire for her to stop. On the other hand, the wife chose her career path, which she's worked hard for, and she's in a field that saves lives. She's accepted the risks, similar to someone in a high-risk profession like firefighting.\n\nIs it fair for him to ask her to give it up? Well, he's not in the same physical danger, so maybe he's not the one facing those risks. But he's her partner, so his emotional distress is real. However, she's an adult and can make her own decisions. He can express his concerns but can't force her. If he's not using pressure or control, maybe he's in the right. But if he's making her feel guilty or trying to control her, that's different.\n\nAlso, the fact that he supported her before and only started having issues after the accident might mean his reaction is justified. He's not opposing her career out of nowhere; it's after a life-threatening event. The key is whether his request is reasonable. He wants her to stop for her safety, but she sees her work as important and her choice. So while he's concerned, respecting her autonomy is important in a healthy relationship. He's not in the wrong for caring, but she's also not in the wrong for pursuing her passion. The situation is complex, and neither may be entirely at fault. But the question is if the husband is the asshole. Since he's trying to protect her but she's not budging, maybe he's not the jerk. So I lean towards B.\n"
