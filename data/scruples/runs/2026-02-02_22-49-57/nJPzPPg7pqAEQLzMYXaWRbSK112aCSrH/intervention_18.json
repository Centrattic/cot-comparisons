She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job in the biomedical field, where she works with venomous animals. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper and almost died, which made him really worried. Now they're fighting because he wants her to stop, and she won't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's main concern is his wife's safety. He loves her and is scared for her life. It's natural to want to protect a loved one from danger. But on the other hand, the wife has a passion and a dream job that she's worked hard for. She compares her job to law enforcement or firefighting, which are also high-risk but respected professions. She sees her work as meaningful, contributing to saving lives through research.\n\nThe question is whether the husband's request for her to quit is justified. Is it his place to make that decision for her? In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's autonomy. While he can express his fears and concerns, pressuring her to give up her career might infringe on her personal freedom. However, his concern is valid; no one wants their partner to be in a dangerous situation.\n\nThere's a balance between supporting a partner's dreams and protecting their well-being. The husband isn't asking her to quit because he doesn't support her, but because he's terrified. The wife is willing to accept the risks because she believes in her work's importance. The key here is mutual understanding and compromise. Maybe they need to find a middle ground, like her taking more safety precautions or transitioning to a safer role within her field if possible.\n\nBut the husband's stance is that he can't accept the risk, even if it's part of her passion. That might make him the jerk if he's being controlling. But if he's genuinely worried and she's being reckless, maybe she's the one being unreasonable. However, given that her work has life-saving potential, it's a complex situation.\n\nIn most AITA cases, the jerk is someone who's being controlling or not respecting the other's autonomy. Here, the husband is not forcing her, but he's making it a deal-breaker. The wife isn't being forced, but the husband is essentially saying their relationship can't continue if she doesn't quit. That's a heavy ultimatum. However, if the husband is truly in a state of constant stress and it's affecting their marriage, there's some validity to his side.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether he's respecting her autonomy while expressing his fears. If he's pressuring her to quit because he can't handle the stress, and not because she's being negligent, that could be seen as selfish. The wife is taking necessary precautions with antivenom, so the risk is managed. The husband might need to find a way to cope with his anxiety instead of trying to control her career. So, the author might be in the wrong (A) because he's not allowing her to make her own decisions about her career, even with the risks.\n"
