She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife is in a high-risk job researching venomous animals. She had a life-threatening incident, and the husband is now very worried. He wants her to stop working with these animals, but she refuses, saying it's her passion and she's saving lives.\n\nSo, the main conflict is between the husband's concern for her safety and her autonomy in choosing her career. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for asking her to quit.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the husband's concern is valid. He loves her and wants to protect her from harm. It's natural to worry when someone you care about is at risk. On the other hand, the wife has a right to pursue her career, especially if she's aware of the risks and they're part of her job's inherent nature, like in professions such as firefighters or police officers. The husband acknowledges the risks but draws a line, which might be seen as overstepping, especially since she's making an informed choice.\n\nAlso, their communication is a factor. The husband mentioned he's had many fights and they're at an impasse. The wife feels it's unfair for him to ask her to give up her dream. The husband might be overreacting after the traumatic event, which is understandable but could be seen as not respecting her autonomy.\n\nIn similar debates, people often argue that while support is needed, one partner shouldn't force another to abandon their career unless there are legal or medical issues. Here, the wife is making her own choices, so the husband's request might be infringing on her independence. However, the husband's fear is real and justified given the incident. It's a tough balance between safety and personal freedom.\n\nMaybe the key point is whether the husband is respecting her autonomy. If he's not forcing her but expressing his concerns and they need to find a compromise, that's different. But he's asking her to stop, which she's not willing to do. The answer might depend on cultural norms or personal values. In some views, the husband is being protective but overreaching, while others might see it as loving support.\n\nI need to decide if his request is unreasonable. Since the wife is in an informed and accepted risky profession, and he's not the one working there, his insistence might be more about his own anxiety rather than her actual risk management. The wife is handling the job safely, as evidenced by having antivenom. The husband's emotional reaction is valid, but it's not the same as her job being inherently unsafe beyond standard risks.\n\nSo, considering all this, the husband might not be in the wrong for having concerns, but he's in the wrong if he's pressuring her to quit a job she's qualified for and passionate about, especially when she's aware of the risks. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her autonomy despite understanding the risks. Alternatively, B if concern for her safety is seen as justified.\n"
