She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. Let me start by understanding the situation. The wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper and almost died. The husband is really worried and wants her to stop working with dangerous animals. She argues it's her passion and she's saving lives, similar to a police officer or firefighter. They're having big fights over this.\n\nHmm, first thought: The husband's concern is understandable. He loves her and doesn't want her to get hurt. But does he have the right to ask her to give up her dream? That's the crux here.\n\nOn one hand, the wife has a valid point. She's in a field she's passionate about, contributing to medical research. She's aware of the risks and has taken on such a role, which she compares to high-risk jobs like police or firefighters. The husband's analogy might not hold because those jobs are public safety roles, but maybe the husband isn't in a position to dictate her career choices.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's fear is real. He's been through a traumatic experience where his wife almost died. His emotional state is affecting their relationship. But is it his place to make that decision for her? She's an adult, and she's made her own choices. He can express his concerns, but forcing her to quit might infringe on her autonomy and her right to pursue her passion.\n\nAlso, the husband never objected before, only after the incident. That might mean he's being reactive rather than supportive. Maybe he should focus on ways to support her safely, like looking into safety measures at her workplace, rather than asking her to quit entirely. \n\nBut then again, if the risks are inherent to the job and can't be mitigated, the husband's fear might be justified. However, it's a balance between his anxiety and her career. He's not threatening her job, but he's expressing a desire for her to quit. That could be seen as overstepping because it's her life and career. \n\nI think the key issue here is consent and mutual respect. The wife has the right to choose her career, even with risks. The husband's fear is valid, but he can't impose his will on her. So maybe the husband is in the wrong because he's trying to control her career choices based on his fears, despite her passion and the risks she's willing to accept. But maybe not? Because he's also showing care and concern. It's a tough balance. \n\nBut if the question is whether he's in the wrong, then the answer would depend on whether his actions are infringing on her autonomy. Since he's asking her to quit, that might be where he's overstepping. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but I'm not 100% sure. Let me check again. The wife is an adult, and unless the job is illegal or she's acting recklessly, he can't make her quit. His concern is valid, but his solution is to take away her career. So maybe A is the answer. But some might argue he's not in the wrong because he's trying to protect her. Hmm.\n"
