She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife has a dream job in biomedical research involving venomous animals. She's passionate about it and it's a significant part of her identity. She almost died from a snake bite but went back to work. The husband, who loves her and has been supportive until now, is now extremely worried about her safety. He's asked her to stop working with the venomous animals, but she feels it's unfair and refuses.\n\nSo, the key points here are the wife's autonomy and passion versus the husband's desire to protect her. The husband argues that her job is dangerous and he can't live with the fear anymore. The wife sees her work as important and comparable to other high-risk professions like police or firefighters.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, autonomy is a big factor. People have the right to make their own career choices, even if there's risk involved. The wife's job contributes to medical research, which could save lives, and she's aware of the risks. The husband's concern is valid because he's invested in her well-being, but does that give him the right to demand she quit her job?\n\nAnother angle is consent and mutual respect in a relationship. The husband didn't object before the incident, so his sudden change in stance might be seen as undermining her career. However, after a near-death experience, his fear is understandable. The question is whether his request is an overreach or if he's within his right to express his concerns.\n\nLegally, the husband can't force her to quit. Morally, it's more complex. The husband is trying to protect her, but the wife has the right to take risks with her own life. The husband's argument that other high-risk jobs are accepted might not hold if the risks are too personal. But he's not asking her to quit being a police officer; he's specifically targeting the dangerous aspect of her job.\n\nSo, the author's position is that he wants her to stop working with venomous animals, not her entire career. If she can continue without that aspect, maybe there's a compromise. But the wife isn't willing to do that. So, is he in the wrong for wanting to protect her? Or is he overstepping her autonomy?\n\nThe answer hinges on whether love and concern justify overriding someone's career choices. Since the wife is an adult and capable of making her own decisions, the husband's request might be seen as controlling. However, his feelings are valid, and relationships involve mutual support. The problem is that the husband is asking her to give up her passion, which could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband's desire to protect his wife is understandable, but forcing her to quit her job infringes on her autonomy. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because the wife's right to pursue her career should be respected, even with the risks involved.\n"
