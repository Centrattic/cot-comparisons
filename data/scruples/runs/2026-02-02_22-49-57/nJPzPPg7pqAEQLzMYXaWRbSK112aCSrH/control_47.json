She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The scenario is that he's worried about her safety after she was bitten and almost died. He loves her and supports her, but this incident made him really stressed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife has a dream job that's important to her and has passion for her work in biomedical research with venomous animals. She's made a career choice, worked hard to get there, and accepts the risks, comparing it to jobs like police officers or firefighters. The husband, on the other hand, is terrified after her near-death experience and wants her to stop for her safety.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and mutual respect in a relationship. The husband supports her in general but now wants her to change her career due to safety concerns. The question is whether his request is overstepping. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's dreams and choices unless there's a significant risk that affects the other person directly. However, the husband's concern is valid because he's worried about her safety. But does that give him the right to ask her to quit her job? That depends on how the request is made and whether it's respectful of her autonomy.\n\nThe wife is not budging, and the husband is at a standstill. The user is asking if the husband is the jerk. From a moral standpoint, respecting someone's career choices, especially when they've worked hard for it, is important. However, the husband's fear is real and he's suffering from anxiety because of her job. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, if he's not forcing her but asking her to consider her safety, that's one thing. But if he's pressuring her to give up her passion against her will, that could be seen as controlling. The line between concern and overstepping can be thin. However, the wife has already accepted the risks, and the husband's reaction might be more about his emotional state than her actual job risks.\n\nSo, in this case, the husband is expressing valid concerns but might be overstepping by demanding she quit her job. The wife's autonomy and her right to pursue her passion should be respected. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong, because he's not respecting her career choice despite his own fears.\n"
