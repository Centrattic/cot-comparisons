She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband (the author) wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job working with venomous animals. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author loves his wife and supports her, but after a serious incident where she was almost killed, he's struggling with the risk. He's worried about her safety and their relationship is suffering because of the stress. On the other hand, the wife is passionate about her work in biomedical research, which contributes to saving lives. She sees her work as a public service, similar to police or firefighters who take risks. \n\nIs the husband being overprotective or is he justified? The key points are: the job is dangerous, there's been a near-death experience, and the husband's mental state is deteriorating because of the stress. However, the wife's career is her passion and she's in a field that could have significant positive impacts.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's choices is crucial. The husband's concern for her safety is valid, but pressuring her to quit might infringe on her autonomy. He wants her to change her career for his peace of mind, not hers. The wife's analogy to first responders highlights that some professions inherently involve risk, and she's accepting that for a greater purpose.\n\nBut the husband is in a state of constant fear, which is affecting their marriage. He might be in the wrong if he's not allowing her to make her own decisions, even though his intentions are good. Conversely, she might be in the wrong if she's not considering his emotional well-being. However, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong.\n\nThe author's argument is that he's not in the wrong, but I need to see if the situation meets that. The husband hasn't forced her to quit, but he's clearly not supporting her anymore. The wife might feel unsupported and unappreciated. The line between support and overstepping can be thin. Since he's asking her to give up her dream job due to his fears, even though she's aware of the risks and willing to take them, he could be seen as the jerk for not respecting her autonomy and career choice. So maybe the answer is A (he is in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, if his fears are justified by the near-death experience, maybe it's B. Hmm.\n"
