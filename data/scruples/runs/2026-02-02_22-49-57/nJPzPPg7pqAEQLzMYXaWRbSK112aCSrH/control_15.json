She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting their wife to give up her dangerous job. The situation is that the wife works with venomous animals, which is risky, and she had a near-death experience. The husband is worried and wants her to stop, but she's passionate about her work and thinks he's being unfair.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the husband is concerned for his wife's safety. It's natural to want to protect a loved one from danger. He's been supportive until the incident, but now his anxiety is causing tension. On the other hand, the wife has a passion for her job and sees the value in her work, similar to someone in a high-risk profession like a firefighter. She's already made the choice to accept the risks because her work can save lives.\n\nIs it fair for the husband to ask her to give up her career? Well, love and partnership often involve compromise. However, can he force her to quit something she loves? That might infringe on her autonomy. The husband's fear is valid, but it's her life and career. Maybe he's right to express his concerns, but he can't dictate her choices. The wife's right to pursue her passion might outweigh his desire for her to stop, even if he's worried. So the husband might not be in the wrong for expressing his feelings, but he's also not right to demand she quit. The answer might be B, he's not in the wrong because he's justified in his concern, but the decision ultimately rests with her. But some might argue that he's overstepping. Need to balance empathy and autonomy here.\n"
