She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals, which has led to a serious incident where she was bitten and almost died. The husband is struggling with the risks and wants her to stop, but she's passionate about her work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's concern is about safety and his emotional well-being, given the near-death experience. He's not forcing her, just asking her to quit. On the other hand, the wife's job is her passion and career, which is important for her personal fulfillment and professional contributions. \n\nThe key points here are consent, mutual respect, and understanding. The husband supports her passions but now feels the risks are too high. The wife respects his concerns but can't abandon her career. They're at an impasse. \n\nLegally, he doesn't have the right to make her quit her job. Morally, it's tricky. He's acting out of love and fear for her safety. She's acting out of her own drive and passion. It's a conflict between personal autonomy and concern for a spouse's well-being. \n\nIn relationships, communication and compromise are crucial. If the husband is constantly stressed and the wife can't find a safer alternative, it might lead to more problems. However, the husband can't force her to stop, and the wife can't ignore his valid concerns. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. He's not being abusive or controlling, just expressing his fears. But he's also not respecting her autonomy. Maybe a middle ground is needed, like her finding a safer role in the same field. But given the options, the husband's actions stem from a place of care, though he might need to find ways to support her without making her quit.\n"
