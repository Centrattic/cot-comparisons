She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The author's wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research and was almost killed by a snake bite. He's stressed and wants her to stop working with such animals, but she won't budge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is valid because the job is dangerous and he's seen her almost die. He loves her and wants to protect her. On the other hand, the wife has a passion for her work, which is important for her happiness and fulfillment. She's in a field where she can contribute to saving lives through research, which is a noble cause. \n\nThe husband didn't ask her to quit before, only after a life-threatening incident. He's not opposing her career entirely but wants her to stop working with the dangerous animals. However, he's making a personal request based on his fears, which might not align with her priorities. \n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's goals is crucial. The wife might feel that her husband isn't respecting her career and autonomy. The husband is struggling with the risk involved, which is understandable, but he's asking her to compromise her passion for his peace of mind. \n\nIt's a tough balance. The question is whether his request is reasonable. While his concern for her safety is valid, he might not be in the wrong because he's acting out of love and fear. However, he's also imposing his anxiety on her decisions. The wife's right to pursue her dream job despite the risks is a factor here. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers autonomy and mutual respect. If the husband is pressuring her to quit without a mutual agreement, that could be seen as controlling. But if he's genuinely scared and trying to protect her, it's a conflict of priorities. \n\nI think the husband's intentions are good, but he's caught between his love and fear. The answer might depend on whether his demands are reasonable. Since he's not asking her to leave her field entirely but to stop working with the dangerous elements, maybe that's a middle ground. However, she might see it as undermining her career. \n\nOverall, it's a complex situation. The husband isn't in the wrong for having valid concerns, but he might need to find a way to support her while managing his own anxiety. The community might see it as both having valid points, but the husband's request could be seen as inconsiderate of her aspirations. \n\nHmm, but the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to check if that's accurate. The husband is in a tough spot, but his actions are based on fear rather than objective risk. The wife's job has safeguards, and she's aware of the risks. The husband's request might not be fair because he's prioritizing his stress over her career. So maybe the answer is A (he is in the wrong) because he's imposing his fears without considering her autonomy. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) because his concern is genuine. It's a tough call, but given the AITA context, the community often emphasizes mutual support and autonomy, so maybe the husband is AITA.\n"
