She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The question is AITA (Am I the Asshole), so they want to know if they're the jerk here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The wife works with venomous animals, which is risky. She had a serious incident with a Gaboon viper, almost died. The husband is worried and wants her to stop for her safety. She's passionate about her work and compares it to high-risk professions like police or firefighters. They've had fights, and now he's seeking validation.\n\nSo, is the husband wrong? Let's consider both sides. The wife is in her dream job, which is important for personal fulfillment. She's aware of the risks and has a job that contributes to science. The husband's concern is about her safety and their relationship. He's not forcing her; he's asking. But is it his place to ask her to give up her career?\n\nOn one hand, supporting a partner's dreams is important. The husband has been supportive until the incident. Now he's scared. On the other, he's asking her to change her career, which is a big deal. It might be seen as overstepping if he can't accept her choice, even though it's risky.\n\nBut he's also concerned for her well-being. If the job is life-threatening, his worry is valid. However, the wife is an adult and capable of making her own decisions. The husband's role is to support her, even if he's worried. Unless there's a way to mitigate the risk without her quitting, maybe they need to find a middle ground.\n\nAlso, the comparison to police/firefighters is relevant. Society often accepts those risks, so why not her job? The husband might not be in the wrong for caring, but he could be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy. It's a tough balance between love and control.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband's intentions are good, but his actions might be infringing on her independence. He's not wrong entirely because he's worried, but he's not respecting her career choice. So, maybe the answer is A, but I need to make sure.\n"
