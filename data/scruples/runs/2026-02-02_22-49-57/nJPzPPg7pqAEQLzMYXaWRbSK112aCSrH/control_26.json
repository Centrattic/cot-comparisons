She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. So, the wife works with venomous animals, had a near-death experience, and he's worried about her safety. They argue about it, and he's wondering if he's the bad guy here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is valid because he loves his wife and doesn't want her to be in danger. It's natural for someone to feel that way, especially after she was bitten and almost died. His emotional response is understandable. On the other hand, the wife has worked hard for her career and sees it as her passion. She compares it to high-risk professions like police or firefighters, which society generally accepts because they save lives.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband's request is inconsiderate. The wife has the right to pursue her career if she's aware of the risks and willing to accept them. However, the husband's fear is real and affecting their relationship. The key point is consent and mutual support. The husband didn't force her before, but after the incident, his concern is stronger. But does that give him the right to ask her to quit? It's a tough balance between personal choice and concern for safety.\n\nThe wife is not forcing him to be worried, and the husband isn't forcing her to take risks. The problem arises when his request becomes a demand. The husband is in a difficult position, but the wife also has the right to her career. The husband might be in the right in terms of his feelings being valid, but he's not the one in the wrong if he's genuinely worried. However, if he's pressuring her to quit against her will, that's where things get complicated. The answer depends on whether his actions are supportive or controlling. Since he's asking for her to give it up, it's a matter of mutual respect. The wife's autonomy is important, so maybe the husband is in the wrong if he's not respecting her choice despite the risks.\n"
