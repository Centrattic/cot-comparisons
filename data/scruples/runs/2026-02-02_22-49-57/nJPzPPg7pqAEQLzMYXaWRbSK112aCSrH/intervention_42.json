She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The story is about a wife with a risky job in biomedical research involving venomous animals. The husband loves her but is terrified of the risks after she almost died from a snakebite. He's asked her to stop, but she refuses, seeing it as her passion and a noble cause.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's concern is valid\u2014her job is dangerous and has already caused near-fatal incidents. His fear for her safety is natural, especially in a relationship. On the other hand, the wife has dedicated her career to this field, which she sees as important for medical research. She might feel that her husband is undermining her autonomy and career choices.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy versus safety. In a healthy relationship, both partners should have the right to pursue their passions unless it directly harms the other. However, when one partner's safety is at risk, it's a different story. The husband isn't trying to control her per se, but he's asking her to give up her job out of fear for her life. The wife's argument is that she's accepting known risks for a greater good, similar to emergency workers.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. The husband has supported her up until the near-death experience, which changed things. His stance now is out of love and fear for her life. But is it his place to decide that for her? The wife's autonomy is important. She might feel that his request is a violation of her independence and career. The husband, however, is struggling with the emotional toll of her work and the potential loss.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Arguably, he's acting out of love and concern, but he's not respecting her agency. If she's aware of the risks and chooses to take them, he can't force her to stop. However, his inability to support her in this choice is causing significant stress in their relationship. The question is whether wanting her to quit is reasonable. In a balanced relationship, both partners should support each other's choices unless it's harmful. The husband's reaction is extreme, leading to conflict. So, is he wrong? Maybe part B, but it's a complex situation where both have valid points. However, the husband's insistence on her giving up her job against her will could be seen as controlling, thus making him part of the problem.\n"
