She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the husband is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, the wife has a job she's passionate about in a risky field. She was seriously injured and still chose to return to work. That shows dedication. The husband is worried about her safety, especially after the incident. He's not forcing her but expressing his concerns. \n\nHe mentions they've had fights and he's not budging. The wife argues he's being unfair. The key points are mutual love and respect versus differing priorities. The husband wants her safety, but she values her career. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize safety? Maybe not, but should he have the authority to make her quit? That's a gray area. The husband is asking for her to give up her dream for his peace of mind. The wife is willing to take the risks, which she's aware of. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, compromise is important. But the husband isn't forcing her; he's expressing his feelings. However, the wife's autonomy and right to pursue her career should also be considered. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural or personal values. Some might say the husband isn't wrong because he's concerned for her safety. Others might say he's not in the wrong because he's respecting her choice, even if he's conflicted. But the question is about being in the wrong. \n\nIf the husband isn't using coercion and is just expressing his feelings, maybe he's not wrong. However, if he's pressuring her to the point of causing rifts, maybe there's an issue. But the scenario states she's not budging, so he's not forcing her. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No) because he's expressing his concerns without controlling her career. But some might argue A (Yes) if he's not respecting her autonomy. Hmm.\n"
