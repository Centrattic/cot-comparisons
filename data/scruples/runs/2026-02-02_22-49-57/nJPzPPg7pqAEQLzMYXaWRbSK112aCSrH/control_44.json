She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The situation is that the wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research, which led to a severe injury. The husband is worried about her safety, while she sees it as her passion and a noble cause.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's concern is valid because he's worried about his wife's safety and their relationship. His fear after the snakebite incident is understandable. On the other hand, the wife has a legitimate career she's passionate about, which contributes to important research. She might feel that her husband is being controlling or not respecting her autonomy.\n\nThe question is about whether the husband is in the wrong. The key points here are about mutual respect in a relationship. While the husband has valid concerns, asking someone to give up their dream job based on fear, especially if they are aware of the risks and have chosen the career path, might be seen as overstepping. The wife's analogy to police officers or firefighters is relevant here\u2014those jobs also have risks, and people in those roles are expected to accept them. If the husband would support her in those roles, it's inconsistent to oppose her current job even if it's dangerous.\n\nHowever, the husband's role as a spouse is to support her, but also to express his concerns. The problem arises if the husband is pressuring her beyond support, making it a demand. The fact that she's not budging and he's not either shows a stalemate. The husband's actions aren't necessarily malicious, but he's imposing his fears onto her career choice, which she might see as a lack of trust or respect.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. Both have valid points. But in relationships, respecting each other's autonomy is crucial. The husband's fear is real, but the wife's right to pursue her passion, especially if she's aware of the risks, should also be respected. The husband might not be in the wrong for having concerns, but he is in the wrong if he's forcing her to quit, as it undermines her agency. So the answer would be A (the husband is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her autonomy and choices despite the risks she accepts.\n"
