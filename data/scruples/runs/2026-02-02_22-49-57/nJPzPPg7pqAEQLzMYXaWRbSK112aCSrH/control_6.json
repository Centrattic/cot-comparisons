She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he wants his wife to give up her job working with venomous animals because it's dangerous. She had a near-death experience from a snake bite and he's worried about her safety. He's not budging, and she's not either.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife has a passion for her work in biomedical research. She's in a field that's important for saving lives through venom research. She's worked hard to get there and sees her job as meaningful, comparing it to a police officer or firefighter taking risks. The husband, on the other hand, is deeply concerned about her safety. After the incident, his fear has led to constant stress, and he can't support her job anymore. He's asking her to quit for her health and safety.\n\nNow, is the husband in the wrong? Well, love and marriage are about compromise, right? But where's the balance here? The husband has supported her up until this incident. He didn't object before, even though he had concerns. Now that there's a life-threatening event, his feelings have intensified. But the wife isn't willing to quit her passion. \n\nOn one hand, he's trying to protect her. It's natural for someone to be worried for their spouse's safety. He's not forcing her, just asking. On the other hand, her job is a significant part of her identity and she's in a field that contributes to society. If he can't support her, it might affect their relationship. \n\nBut wait, is it his place to ask her to quit? That's the crux. He loves her and wants her safe, but she's an adult and can make her own decisions. He's not her boss, so he can't make her stop. However, if this is causing a rift and he can't be supportive, maybe he's being unrealistic. But given the danger and the emotional toll, maybe he's justified in his feelings. \n\nSome might argue that he's being overprotective or not respecting her autonomy. Others might say he's being a supportive partner by trying to protect her. The key here is whether his request is reasonable. Since she's in a high-risk job by choice and she's aware of the dangers, does he have the right to ask her to give it up? Probably not, but he's in a tough spot emotionally. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because he's acting out of concern for her safety, which is understandable. However, others might say he's being irrational. But given the context, the main issue is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not forcing her and is expressing his feelings, maybe he's not the jerk here. The wife's choice to continue is her own, but the husband's fear is valid. So, B seems like the answer.\n"
