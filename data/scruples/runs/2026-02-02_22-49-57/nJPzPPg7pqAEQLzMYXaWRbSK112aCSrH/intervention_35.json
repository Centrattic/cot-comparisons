She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The situation is that the wife works with venomous animals, faced a serious accident, and the husband is now extremely worried. He's asked her to stop, but she refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband loves his wife and supports her in general, but this job poses a real risk. He's not asking her to give up her passion lightly, especially after she almost died. His concern is about her safety and their relationship. On the other hand, the wife's job is her dream, and she's in a field that can save lives. She's taken the job knowing the risks, similar to someone in law enforcement.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and mutual respect in relationships. The husband is expressing his fears and concerns, which is valid. He's not forcing her but asking her to consider his feelings. However, the wife has the right to pursue her career, even if it's risky. The problem might be more about communication and finding a middle ground rather than who is right or wrong.\n\nBut the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If he's not pressuring her but genuinely expressing his concerns, it's reasonable. However, if he's pressuring her to quit despite her understanding the risks, that could be a conflict. The husband is in a tough spot, balancing his love and fear. The wife's career is important to her, and she's accepted the risks. So, is the husband overstepping by asking her to quit, or is he just expressing legitimate concern?\n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because he's acting out of love and fear for her safety. However, the wife has the right to her career. It's a complex situation where both have valid points. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer would lean towards B (No) because he's expressing his feelings and concerns, not forcing her. But there's nuance here. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values, but given the info, B seems correct.\n"
