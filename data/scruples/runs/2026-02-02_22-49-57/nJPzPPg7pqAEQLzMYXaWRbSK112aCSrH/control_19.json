She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The situation is that his wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research, which is risky. She got bitten and almost died, and now he wants her to stop. She's passionate about her work and compares it to high-risk jobs like firefighters. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is valid because her job is life-threatening. He loves her and wants her to be safe. On the other hand, the wife has a passion and a career she worked hard for. She's in a field that contributes to medical advancements. \n\nThe key points here are consent, mutual respect, and the balance between personal safety and career. The husband hasn't forced her to quit yet; he's just expressing his wishes. But is he wrong to prioritize her safety, even if it means her losing her job? \n\nMarriages often involve compromises. However, asking someone to abandon their dream job is a big ask, especially in a profession that's seen as having inherent risks. The wife's comparison to jobs like police or firefighting is relevant because those are also high-risk but socially accepted. \n\nThe husband's request is based on fear and love, but it's also a matter of control. Is it fair for him to make that decision for her? The wife has the right to take calculated risks in her career, even if others don't agree. \n\nBut at the same time, the husband's emotional state is suffering. He's constantly worried, which affects their relationship. However, that's not a justification for controlling her career. The line between concern and overstepping is thin here. \n\nI need to check if there's any legal or ethical obligation here. Legally, he can't force her to quit unless there are specific legal reasons. Ethically, it's about autonomy. She has the right to make her own choices, even risky ones. \n\nMaybe the husband isn't in the wrong for caring about her safety, but he's in the wrong if he's pressuring her to quit without her consent. The question is whether his request is reasonable. Since her job is her passion and she's aware of the risks, he can't unilaterally decide for her. \n\nThe answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's imposing his will on her career. However, some might argue that he's justified in his concern. But the key here is that the wife is making her own decisions, and the husband can express his concerns but can't force her to stop. So the answer is A.\n"
