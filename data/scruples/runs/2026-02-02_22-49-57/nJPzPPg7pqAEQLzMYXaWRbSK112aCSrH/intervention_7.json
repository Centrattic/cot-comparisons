She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband loves his wife and supports her, but after a near-death experience, he's really scared. He's not forcing her to quit but is asking her to stop working with venomous animals for her safety. The wife is passionate about her work in biomedical research, which has high risks, and she compares it to other high-risk jobs like police or firefighters.\n\nSo, the main issue is balancing personal safety and career passion versus a spouse's concern. The husband's fear is valid after her injury. But is it fair to ask her to give up her career? Well, the wife has the right to pursue her passion, even with risks. The husband's role is to support her unless there's a compelling reason. But he's not forcing her, just asking. But maybe he's not respecting her autonomy. However, he's justified in his concern for her safety. \n\nBut then again, the wife chose this career, and it's her life. The husband can express his fear, but he can't control her choices. The fact that they're having a rift shows the conflict. So, is he the jerk? Maybe not entirely in the wrong because his concern is real, but he's not respecting her agency. However, since he's not forcing her, maybe it's a matter of communication rather than being wrong. The answer might be a bit nuanced, but the user wants a binary answer. \n\nIn AITA threads, people often consider autonomy and consent. Since the wife is making the choice, the husband's concern is valid, but the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue he's being overbearing. But given that he's not forcing her and she's aware of the risks, maybe B is correct. The husband isn't in the wrong because he's expressing valid concerns, even if the wife doesn't agree. So, answer B.\n"
