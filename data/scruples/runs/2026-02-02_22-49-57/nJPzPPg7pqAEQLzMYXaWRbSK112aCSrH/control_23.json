She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals and had a near-fatal snake bite. The husband is worried about her safety and wants her to stop, but she's not willing to give up her passion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is valid; he loves his wife and wants to protect her from harm. It's natural for a spouse to be worried about the other's safety. On the other hand, the wife has a passion for her work and has worked hard to achieve her career. She's accepted the risks, similar to how someone might accept the risks of being a police officer or firefighter.\n\nBut wait, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Is it fair for him to ask her to quit? In relationships, respecting each other's choices is important. If the wife is aware of the risks and has made an informed decision, the husband can't force her to stop. However, his emotional state is suffering, and he's constantly stressed. That's a valid concern too.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The wife is choosing her job; the husband is expressing his concerns. But he's not forcing her; he's asking her to quit. The line here is whether his request is an overstep. It's a matter of personal choice versus concern for safety. \n\nIn many cases, people in risky professions are allowed to make that choice as long as they're aware of the risks. The husband's love and concern are genuine, but he can't make that decision for her. So, from a rights perspective, he's not in the wrong for expressing his feelings, but he's also not in a position to make her quit. However, the fact that he's causing a rift and not budging could be seen as a problem. The wife's career is her own, and the husband can't override her autonomy. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because his concern is valid, but the final decision lies with the wife. However, another angle might suggest that he's overstepping by pressuring her to give up her career, which could make him in the wrong. But the original question is whether he's \"in the wrong,\" which could depend on cultural or societal norms. In many views, it's the individual's right to choose their career, so the husband isn't wrong in feeling this way, but he can't make her stop. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
