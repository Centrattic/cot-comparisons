She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dream job because it's dangerous. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the wife is in the biomedical field, working with venomous animals for research that could help treat health issues. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper, which was life-threatening. The husband has always been uneasy but never objected before. Now, after this incident, he's really struggling and wants her to stop working with venomous animals for her safety. She's passionate about her work and compares it to high-risk jobs like firefighters or police. They're having conflicts because neither is budging.\n\nSo the question is, is the husband in the wrong? Let's break it down. On one hand, he's concerned for her safety, which is a valid and caring reason. On the other hand, he's asking her to give up her dream job and passion, which is a significant part of her identity and career. The wife is in a field that has societal benefits, and she's choosing to take on the risks because of her passion.\n\nIn relationships, there's a balance between supporting each other's goals and personal safety. The husband's concern is legitimate, but pushing her to quit might infringe on her autonomy. The wife's argument is that she's aware of the risks and has a purpose, similar to other high-risk professions. The husband's stance could be seen as overstepping if he's not willing to find a compromise or if he's not respecting her agency. However, it's also understandable for someone to be terrified after a near-death experience of a loved one.\n\nThe key factors here are mutual respect, communication, and finding a middle ground. If the husband is using fear and emotional pressure without considering alternatives (like safety measures, job modifications), then he might be in the wrong. But if he's trying to protect her and she's not hearing his concerns, maybe there's a misunderstanding. The fact that they're both stuck shows a lack of compromise. The husband's position is about safety, but is it his right to dictate her career choices? Typically, autonomy in such matters is important. Unless there's a legal or moral obligation, forcing someone to abandon their career isn't usually justified. So the husband's approach might be seen as overbearing, leading to the conclusion that he's in the wrong. But I need to consider cultural or contextual factors too. In some cases, partners might make such sacrifices, but it's not a one-size-fits-all situation. The answer likely hinges on respecting her agency versus his protective instincts. Since the wife is aware of the risks and still chooses the job, the husband's insistence could be seen as invalidating her choices. So the answer might be A, but I'm a bit conflicted because his concern is genuine. However, the wife's right to pursue her passion shouldn't be overridden by the husband's fears unless there's an immediate, unavoidable danger. In this case, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong entirely, but the answer options are A or B. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If the author is the one being controlling, then A. If he's just concerned and hasn't forced her yet, maybe B. The post says he's asked her to stop, but she's not budging. The key is whether his request is reasonable. Since her job is a high-risk but she's aware and it's her career, the husband is in the wrong (A). But maybe there's a middle ground. Hmm. I think the answer is A because he's asking her to give up her dream job based on his fears, not hers. So author is in the wrong, answer A.\n"
