She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The question is presented as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research, which is inherently risky. She had a serious accident but still wants to continue. The husband is concerned for her safety and has asked her to stop working with these animals. The wife feels it's unfair and a betrayal of her passion.\n\nHusbands often worry about their partners' safety, especially in high-risk jobs. But the key points here are: Does the husband have the right to make that decision for her? Is his concern valid, or is he overstepping? \n\nThe wife's job has risks, but she's aware and chooses to accept them. She's passionate about her work and it contributes to saving lives. The husband's argument is that he can't handle the stress and that he'd feel the same if she were in another high-risk job like police or firefighting. However, those jobs are typically more socially accepted as necessary and come with standard safety protocols. \n\nThe husband's request is to stop working with venomous animals, which is a direct change the wife might not be willing to make. Marriage involves mutual support and compromise. While the husband's fear is valid, demanding her to quit her job could be seen as controlling. On the other hand, the wife's job does pose a real danger, and the husband's emotional response is understandable.\n\nBut in terms of autonomy, the wife has a right to pursue her career as long as she's aware of the risks. The husband's concern is about her safety, but he can't unilaterally decide that for her. They need to find a middle ground, maybe discussing safety measures or counseling. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If he's pressuring her to quit without considering her autonomy and her passion, that's where he's being an asshole. However, if he's expressing his fears and trying to communicate, maybe not. The line is between concern and control. Since he's asking her to give up her career, which is a significant life decision, that's where the issue lies. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her autonomy despite valid reasons.\n"
