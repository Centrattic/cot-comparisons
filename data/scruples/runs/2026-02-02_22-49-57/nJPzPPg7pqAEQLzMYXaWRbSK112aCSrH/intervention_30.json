She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The situation is that his wife works in a biomedical field with venomous animals, and after a near-death experience, he wants her to stop, but she's refusing. He's struggling with this and feels it's causing a rift between them. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The husband's main concern is his wife's safety. He loves her and is worried about her risking her life. After she was bitten and almost died, his anxiety is justified. On the other hand, the wife has a passion for her job, which she's worked hard to achieve. She sees her work as meaningful, saving lives through research, and compares it to jobs like firefighters or police officers, which are known for their risks.\n\nSo, the key points are: the husband's protective instincts vs. the wife's autonomy and career. Is the husband overstepping by asking her to quit? Well, he's not forcing her; he's asking. But he's in a position where he's trying to protect her, which is natural. However, she has the right to make her own career choices, even if they carry risks. The problem is that their priorities are clashing\u2014his desire for her safety vs. her desire for fulfillment.\n\nIn such cases, communication is key. The husband's approach might be seen as controlling if he's not allowing her to make her own decisions. But given the near-fatal incident, his fear is real. However, it's important to respect her autonomy unless there's a legal or mental health issue, which isn't mentioned here. The wife understands his concerns but still chooses her path. The husband needs to accept that he can't control every risk in her life. So, while his intentions are good, he might be in the wrong for not accepting her choice. But maybe he's not in the wrong if he's genuinely concerned and trying to protect her. The line here is between support and overstepping. Since he's asking, not forcing, and he's trying to communicate, maybe B is the answer. But I need to be careful. In relationships, respecting each other's choices is crucial. So if she's not in danger of harm (like she's not mentally ill or a minor), then he can't make that choice for her. Thus, he's not in the wrong for caring, but he might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy. Hmm. It's a tough call. The answer might depend on cultural norms and relationship dynamics, but generally, one person can't dictate another's career choices unless there's a legal authority. So the author is in the wrong for trying to make that decision for his wife, even if his reasons are good. Therefore, answer A.\n"
