She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a husband who's been with his wife for almost ten years, married for about five. His wife works with venomous animals in the biomedical field, researching how venom can be used for medical treatments. She's had a recent incident where she was bitten by a Gaboon viper, almost died, but recovered and went back to work. The husband is worried about her safety and has asked her to stop working with venomous animals. She refuses, saying it's her passion and comparing her job to high-risk professions like police or firefighters. They've had fights, and he's wondering if he's the asshole for wanting her to quit her job for her safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he loves his wife and wants her to be safe. He's clearly very worried after the near-death experience. On the other hand, the wife is passionate about her work and sees it as having a positive impact, similar to other high-risk jobs. \n\nIs the husband overstepping by asking her to quit? Well, he's not forcing her; he's making a request based on his concerns. But is it reasonable to ask someone to leave their dream job because of the risks? The wife's job does involve danger, but so do other professions. The husband accepts that for others but not for her. Is that fair?\n\nThe wife's counterargument is that she's aware of the risks and has chosen to accept them for the sake of her passion and the potential benefits of her work. The husband can't accept that. This is a conflict between personal safety and autonomy versus the partner's emotional well-being.\n\nI think the key here is whether the husband has the right to make this request. He's not the one working the job, so he's not the one making the daily decisions about the risks. He's expressing his feelings and concern, which is valid, but is it his place to demand she stop? If she's making an informed choice, even a risky one, perhaps the husband's role is to support her while expressing his fears, not to demand she quit. \n\nHowever, they are in a committed relationship, so mutual support and compromise are important. If the stress is causing a rift, maybe they need to find a middle ground. But the husband isn't budging, and he's not in the job himself. The wife's autonomy and career choice are significant factors here. So, is the husband wrong for prioritizing safety over her career? \n\nI think the answer depends on whose rights and autonomy we prioritize. The wife has the right to pursue her career, even with risks. The husband has the right to his feelings and to express them. But asking her to quit might be overstepping. It's a tough call. The husband isn't wrong in feeling worried, but insisting she leave her job could be seen as infringing on her autonomy. The wife might be in the right to pursue her passion, even with risks, so the husband could be in the wrong for not supporting her choice. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. Maybe they could work together to mitigate risks, like safety measures, or the wife moving to a less dangerous aspect of her field. However, the husband is not open to that, so it's a stalemate. \n\nIn the end, the husband is expressing his love through wanting her to be safe, but the wife's choice is also a valid part of her identity. The husband's request might be seen as controlling or dismissing her agency. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he's asking her to give up her career for his peace of mind, even though she's made an informed decision. On the other hand, if the job is extremely dangerous and the husband's concern is reasonable, maybe it's a mutual issue. But I think the general consensus would lean towards the husband being wrong because individuals have the right to take calculated risks in their careers, especially when it's their passion.\n"
