She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband loves his wife and supports her, but he's terrified because her job involves venomous animals. She got bitten and almost died, which really shook him. He's worried to the point of being stressed every time she goes to work. He's asked her to stop working with these animals, but she's passionate about her research and sees it as important. She compares it to jobs like police or firefighters that have risks, but he can't accept it.\n\nOn one hand, the husband's concerns are valid. He's worried about her safety and their future. It's natural for a spouse to want to protect their partner. He's not forcing her but is expressing his fear. But on the other hand, her job is her passion and career. She's aware of the risks and has a responsibility to her work. She's already taken measures like having antivenom available.\n\nThe question is whether his request is reasonable. Some might say that while his feelings are understandable, he can't control her career choices. Others might think that after a traumatic event, his concern is justified. The line between supporting her and wanting her to quit is blurry. It's about balancing personal safety with professional aspirations.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband needs to respect her autonomy, but also express his fears. However, demanding she quit her job might be overstepping. It's possible he's not in the wrong because he's genuinely worried, but there's a chance his approach is too controlling. It depends on the dynamics of their relationship and how they handle it. \n\nConsidering all angles, I think the husband isn't entirely in the wrong because his intentions are protective, but he might not be considering her perspective enough. However, the answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong, because he's expressing his concerns. But some might argue A because he's pressuring her to change her career. I need to see which is more prevalent. The Reddit community often tends to support autonomy, so maybe A. But her job is risky, so maybe B. Hmm.\n"
