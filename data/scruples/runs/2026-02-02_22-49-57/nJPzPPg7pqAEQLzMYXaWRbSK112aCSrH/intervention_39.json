She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the person who asked the question (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The scenario is that the wife works with venomous animals and has a high-risk job. She got bitten and almost died, which made the husband really worried. He asked her to stop working with the venomous animals, but she's not willing to give up her dream job, comparing it to jobs like police or firefighters. They're fighting about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is valid because he loves his wife and wants her to be safe. His fear after seeing her almost die is understandable. On the other hand, the wife has worked hard for her career, which contributes to important research. She accepts the risks, similar to someone in a high-risk profession. \n\nThe question is about whether the husband is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants others' opinions. I should think about relationship dynamics. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's goals is key. But safety is also a concern. The husband isn't trying to control her per se, but is expressing his fear for her safety. However, he can't force her to quit, and she's making a valid point by comparing her job to other risky professions. \n\nThe husband's problem is that he can't handle the stress and emotional toll of her job. That's a personal issue, maybe. The wife's stance is about her autonomy and passion. The husband's request is based on his feelings, but he's asking her to compromise her career. However, he's not physically preventing her or being abusive; he's just expressing his concerns. \n\nIt's possible that the husband is in a tough spot, but is he in the wrong? If he's not respecting her autonomy and her choice to take the risks, then maybe he is. But if he's just expressing his feelings and not forcing her, then perhaps not. The line is between expressing concern versus controlling behavior. The husband isn't forcing her; he's just asking her to leave her job, which she refuses. \n\nBut in the end, the answer might depend on whether mutual respect is maintained. The husband's stance could be seen as not respecting her autonomy, but his fear is genuine. So maybe B (not in the wrong) because his intention is to protect her, even if his approach isn't working. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) if it's about him not respecting her choices. \n\nHmm. The wife has the right to make her own choices, even if they're risky. The husband's role is to support her unless there's a compelling reason. However, after her injury, his fear is real. But asking her to quit her job is a big ask. Maybe the real issue is communication and finding a middle ground. But the question is about who's in the wrong. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because he's expressing his feelings and concerns, even though he can't make her stop. The wife is the one who can't quit her job. So the answer is B.\n"
