She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's wife works with venomous animals in her research job, and after she was bitten and nearly died, the author is now asking her to quit for her safety. The wife is passionate about her work and sees it as similar to high-risk jobs like police or firefighters, where the risks are accepted for the greater good. They're arguing now, and the author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my take. \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The wife's job is dangerous, and the author's concern is valid because she was injured and it's life-threatening. The author has supported her before but now is more insistent after the incident. The wife sees it as her passion and her career choice, and the author is making a request based on safety, not necessarily forcing her. \n\nIn relationships, partners often have to balance individual desires with each other's well-being. The author isn't trying to control her career but is voicing a safety concern. The wife, on the other hand, values her career and autonomy. The question is whether the author's request is overstepping.\n\nBut where's the line? The author's concern is legitimate because her job puts her life at risk. However, the wife has the right to make her own career choices. The author is asking her to give up her passion out of fear, which might be seen as being controlling. On the other hand, the author is expressing a valid safety concern after a traumatic event. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about respect for each other's choices. If the author is pressuring her to quit without her consent, that could be seen as a problem. But the author is trying to protect her spouse, which is a natural instinct. The wife could also be seen as not considering the partner's feelings, but she's not in danger if she chooses to take the risk. \n\nSo, the author's request is from a place of love and concern. However, the wife's autonomy is important. The author might not be in the wrong for expressing concern, but the wife is also not wrong for wanting to continue her work. It's a conflict between two valid perspectives. \n\nIn AITA terms, the author might not be the asshole because they're acting out of care. However, if the author is being controlling or not respecting her autonomy, that could tip it. The key is whether the author is using the near-death experience as a reason to control her career, which could be seen as overstepping. But if it's a mutual discussion and the author is expressing their feelings without forcing her to quit, then it's more of a relationship issue where both have valid points. \n\nGiven that the author says \"asked her to stop\" but the wife is not budging, and the author is struggling with the stress, it's a tough spot. The author's actions are motivated by fear for her safety, which is understandable. The wife's refusal is about her own passions and career. The author isn't in the wrong for caring, but the wife isn't in the wrong for wanting to continue. However, the AITA question is about the author's stance. \n\nIn most cases, people are expected to respect each other's choices unless there's direct harm. The author is trying to prevent harm, but it's the wife's own career and body. So maybe the author is overstepping by pressuring her to quit. However, the near-death event adds weight to the concern. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're coming from a place of love and concern. However, the situation is complex, and the author might need to find a middle ground rather than insisting on quitting. But in terms of being the asshole, the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to protect their spouse."
