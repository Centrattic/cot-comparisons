She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The author's wife works with venomous animals and was bitten, which almost killed her. The author is worried and wants her to stop for safety, but she sees it as her passion and a noble cause.\n\nHmm, so first, the key points here are the conflict between safety and personal dreams. The author's concern is valid because the job is dangerous and she's already been harmed. But the wife's perspective is that it's her passion and she's contributing to important research. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author is trying to protect his wife, which is a natural instinct. But is it fair to ask her to give up her career? Maybe not, because it's her choice and autonomy. However, the wife continued working after almost dying, which might show she's aware of the risks and still chooses to take them. \n\nThe author mentions they've had many fights and neither is budging. So he's not forcing her; he's asking. But the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" From a rights perspective, the wife has the right to pursue her career, even with risks. The author can express his concerns, but he shouldn't force her to quit. However, he's also in a relationship where he feels this stress, which is understandable. \n\nBut is he wrong for wanting her to leave the job? Well, he's not the one working the job, but he's the one who has to deal with the emotional toll. However, that's part of being in a relationship. The wife's autonomy might be more important here. So maybe the author is not in the wrong because his intentions are good, but he's overstepping by pressuring her to change her life choices. \n\nWait, but the wife chose her career. If she's aware of the risks and still wants to do it, the author can't force her to stop. His desire is based on fear, which is valid, but he's not in a position to make that decision for her. So maybe he's in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author is not in the wrong. Hmm. I need to weigh the emotional impact versus personal freedom. In relationships, it's common for partners to have differing views on risk. The author is expressing his fear, but the wife's right to her career is her choice. So perhaps the answer is no, the author isn't in the wrong because he's acting out of love and concern, even if it's not the wife's decision to make. But some might argue he is in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nThis is tricky. In many cases, people are encouraged to support their partner's dreams unless there's an immediate threat. However, the author's concern is real. The wife's job is dangerous, and he's worried about her safety. But the wife is an adult and can make her own decisions. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for expressing his feelings but is in the wrong for trying to make her quit. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting her to give it up. If he's not forcing her but is just expressing his wish, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he's pressuring her or causing conflict, that's another matter. The original post says they've had fights and he's not budging. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting her choice. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's trying to control her career choices despite her autonomy and passion. But others might say B (not in the wrong) because he's acting out of love. The correct answer depends on the balance between personal freedom and a partner's safety concerns.\n"
