She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by reading through the details again.\n\nThe user is married to his wife for about five years, and she's been with him for almost ten. She works in biomedical research with venomous animals, which is her passion. He's always supported her, but after she was bitten and almost died, he's been really stressed and wants her to quit. She doesn't want to, arguing that her job is important and she accepts the risks. They're in a stalemate now, and he's asking if he's the asshole for wanting her to give up her dream job.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about support in a relationship versus personal safety. The husband wants her to stop for safety reasons, and the wife wants to continue with her work. Both have valid points. \n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's concerned about her safety and well-being. After a life-threatening incident, it's natural to be worried. He's not asking her to give up her career entirely, just the dangerous part of it. He's expressed his concerns, but she's not budging. \n\nOn the wife's side, her job is a dream she's worked hard for. She compares it to jobs like firefighters, which have inherent risks. She's willing to accept the risks because her work can save lives. She sees it as unfair to be asked to stop when she's making a contribution.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. In relationships, mutual respect and support are important. If the husband is trying to control her career choices solely based on his fear, that could be seen as overstepping. However, his concern for her safety is legitimate. The problem is balancing his anxiety with her autonomy and career goals.\n\nBut the husband mentions he's been supportive all along, only starting to push after the incident. He's not trying to end her career but wants her to stop working with venomous animals. If that's possible without giving up her research, maybe there are compromises. However, if she can't switch roles within her job, then the request might be unrealistic.\n\nIt also depends on how the husband is handling the situation. If he's using guilt or pressure, that's a red flag. But if he's having open discussions and trying to find solutions together, that's different. The post says they've had many fights and are at an impasse. The wife feels it's unfair, and the husband feels it's necessary.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The husband's concern isn't irrational, but he's asking her to sacrifice her career. The wife's right to pursue her passion is also valid. So, depending on the perspective, he might be seen as not wrong because his intention is to protect her, but he could also be overstepping by not respecting her autonomy.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband is being overly controlling or if he's genuinely trying to express his fears and find a solution. Since he's trying to communicate his concerns and she's not budging, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's using his position to control her choices, then maybe he is. The line between support and control is thin here. Since the wife is in a high-risk job and he's asking her to stop the dangerous part, it's a reasonable request from his side, but the wife has every right to refuse. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted because both sides have valid points.\n"
