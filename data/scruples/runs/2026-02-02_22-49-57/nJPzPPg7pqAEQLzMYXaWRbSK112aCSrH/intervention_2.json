She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a wife working with venomous animals, and the husband is asking her to quit because of the danger. The wife is passionate about her job, and the husband is worried about her safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is valid because his wife was bitten and almost died. He's worried about her safety and their relationship. On the other hand, the wife has a passion for her work and sees it as important, similar to high-risk professions like police or firefighters. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong by asking her to quit. The key points here are consent, mutual support in a relationship, and personal autonomy. The husband has expressed his concerns but hasn't forced her to quit. He's trying to communicate his fears. However, the wife has the right to pursue her career if she's aware of the risks. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, partners support each other's goals unless there's a compelling reason to intervene. The husband's fear is understandable, but it's her life and career. He shouldn't dictate her choices unless there's a legal or ethical issue, which isn't the case here. The danger is inherent in her job, and she's accepted that risk. \n\nSo, the husband isn't wrong for expressing his concerns, but he might be overstepping by asking her to quit. The answer might lean towards B (No, he's not in the wrong), but there's a nuance. However, the main point is that the wife has the right to make her own decisions about her career, even with risks. Therefore, the husband isn't in the wrong for expressing his worries, but the situation shows a conflict in their relationship that needs mutual understanding. The answer is B.\n"
