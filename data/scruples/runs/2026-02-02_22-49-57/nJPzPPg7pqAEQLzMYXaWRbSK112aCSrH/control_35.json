She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (who is a husband) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dream job because it's dangerous. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The husband loves his wife and supports her, but he's really worried about her safety after she was almost killed by a snake bite. His fear is causing a rift in their relationship. He's not forcing her, but he's clearly upset and wants her to stop. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife is passionate about her work in biomedical research. Her job involves dangerous animals, but she's aware of the risks and believes in the importance of her research. After an accident, she went back to work because it's her passion. She sees her job as comparable to a police officer or firefighter, who also take risks to help others.\n\nSo, is the husband wrong? Well, he's concerned about her safety, which is understandable. But he's asking her to give up her career, which is a big part of her identity and passion. Even though he's not forcing her, the fact that they're in a relationship means that his request is a significant pressure on her. \n\nHowever, the wife is an adult, and she's making her own decisions. The husband's concern is based on love and worry, but it's also true that he can't control her choices. The key here is that he's not being violent or coercive; he's expressing his feelings and concerns. But he's in a position where his emotional needs are conflicting with her career aspirations. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether supporting someone's career, even if it's risky, is a reasonable expectation in a relationship. The husband is not telling her she can't work at all, just that she should stop working with dangerous animals. However, that's a core part of her job. \n\nIn some ways, he's not in the wrong because he's voicing his fears. But in another angle, he's trying to control her life choices, which could be seen as disrespectful. The fact that they've had fights and a rift shows that there's a communication issue. The wife might feel that her husband isn't supporting her, while he feels she's not considering his feelings. \n\nThe answer is probably B (No), because the husband's concern is valid, but he's not the one in the wrong. However, it's a complex situation where both have valid points. The key is that the wife is making her own decisions, and the husband is expressing his feelings, which isn't inherently wrong. But maybe he's being irrational by not respecting her choice, even if he disagrees. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong, but it's a tough spot. The wife's choice is hers, and the husband's concern is real, but he can't force her to change her career. So he's not the jerk, but he's in a difficult position."
