She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this Reddit post is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the husband wants his wife to quit her dangerous job working with venomous animals. She had a serious snakebite incident, and he's really worried about her safety. He's been supportive before but now can't handle the stress anymore. She argues that this is her passion and her job can save lives, comparing it to police or firefighters. They're fighting, and he's asking if he's the a**hole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about autonomy versus safety. The wife's right to pursue her career versus the husband's concern for her well-being. The husband isn't physically forcing her to quit, but he's expressing his feelings and trying to get her to consider his perspective. However, the wife is an adult and has the right to make her own decisions about her career. The husband's role is to support her, even if he has concerns. \n\nBut there's a cultural aspect here. In many relationships, partners support each other's dreams unless there's a compelling reason. The wife's job is risky, but she's aware of the risks and made a conscious choice. The husband's anxiety is valid, but he can't make her quit. He can express his fears, maybe suggest precautions, but can't dictate her career choices. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to communicate his feelings, which is reasonable. The issue is whether he's overstepping by asking her to quit. If he's not pressuring her but expressing his concerns, maybe it's not his fault. But if he's making it a point of contention in their relationship, it might be his issue. \n\nThe fact that she returned to work after the incident shows she's committed. The husband's problem is with the risk, even though she's accepted it. So, the husband might be the a**hole for not respecting her autonomy. Alternatively, he's just trying to protect her. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the husband not being in the wrong because he's voicing his concerns, but the wife's right to her career is also important. However, the husband can't control her decisions. The question is if he's in the wrong for wanting her to quit. Since he's not forcing her, but just asking, maybe he's not the a**hole. But if he's causing conflict over her valid career choice, maybe he is. \n\nI need to decide if he's wrong. In most cases, people don't like when a partner tries to limit their career for safety. The wife's job is her passion and she's aware of the risks. So the husband might be wrong for not supporting her and causing rifts. Therefore, answer A (he is in the wrong).\n"
