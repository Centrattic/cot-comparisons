She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The scenario is that the wife works with venomous animals, had a near-fatal snake bite, and the husband is now worried about her safety. He's not forcing her but is asking her to consider stopping. The wife is upset because it's her dream job and she compares her job to police or firefighters who also take risks.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The husband loves his wife and is concerned for her safety, which is a valid emotion. After a life-threatening incident, it's natural for him to want her to be safe. However, he's not saying she must quit; he's expressing his feelings and asking her to consider it. \n\nThe wife's perspective is that she has a passion and a career she worked hard for. She's aware of the risks and chooses to accept them. Comparing her job to other high-risk professions makes sense, as she's contributing to important research. \n\nNow, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's not being coercive. He's sharing his fears and trying to communicate. It's understandable for him to have this concern. However, the wife has the right to make her own career choices, especially if she's aware of the risks. \n\nBut the key here is that the husband isn't forcing her, just expressing his feelings. So, while he's not wrong for caring, the wife's autonomy is important. The fact that it's causing a rift suggests that their communication might be the issue, but the husband's position isn't inherently wrong. It's a tough spot, but he's not in the wrong for wanting her to consider her safety. So the answer would be B.\n"
