She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife is in a high-risk job researching venomous animals. She was bitten, almost died, but she still wants to continue. The husband is really worried and can't handle the stress anymore. They've had fights about it, and he's asking if he's the a**hole for wanting her to quit.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the husband is concerned for his wife's safety. It's natural to want to protect someone you love, especially after a near-death experience. But on the other hand, the wife has a passion for her work and sees it as her dream job. She's in a field that can contribute to saving lives through research, similar to high-risk professions like police or firefighters, which she compares it to. The husband agrees with the sentiment but still can't accept the risk.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The key points are: mutual respect in a relationship, the wife's autonomy over her career, and the husband's right to express his concerns. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's goals and passions unless there's a compelling reason to intervene. The husband has expressed his fears and asked her to quit, which she refuses. However, asking someone to give up their career due to personal anxiety might overstep, especially if the job is her passion and she's aware of the risks. \n\nBut it's also important to acknowledge his valid concerns. He's not asking her to stop for his own convenience but because he's genuinely scared for her life. However, the decision to continue in a risky job is hers, as long as she's making an informed choice. \n\nThe line between support and control is thin here. The husband's actions might be seen as overbearing if he's pressuring her to quit without considering her autonomy. At the same time, he's not forcing her; he's just expressing his feelings and trying to find a solution. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It might depend on how he approaches the issue. If he's respectful and they're working together to find a compromise, maybe not. But if he's being controlling and not respecting her choice, then perhaps he is. The story says they've hit a wall, so maybe both are at fault. But the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong) because he's asking her to sacrifice her dream based on his fears, even though he understands the value of her work. However, others might argue B (not in the wrong) because he's protecting her. But typically, in such situations, respecting a partner's autonomy is key unless there's a legal or safety issue. Since the wife is an adult and the job is her choice, the husband might be overstepping by pressuring her to quit.\n"
