She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he wants his wife to give up her job with venomous animals because it's dangerous, even though she's passionate about it and it's in a biomedical field helping people. He's asking for opinions on whether he's the a**hole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife is working in a high-risk job that she loves and has worked hard for. Her argument is that she's in a profession that can save lives, similar to firefighters or police officers, and that she accepts the risks for her passion. The author, on the other hand, is genuinely scared for her safety, especially after she was bitten and almost died. He's tried to support her before but now is worried about her health to the point where it's causing marital issues.\n\nSo, the key points here are the balance between personal safety and career passion, and how partners handle such conflicts. Is it fair for him to ask her to quit her job? Well, he's not forcing her, he's just making a request based on fear. But she has a right to her own career choices, especially if she's made an informed decision to accept those risks. \n\nIn relationships, it's common for partners to have differing views on work-life balance, risk tolerance, and personal goals. One person's concern for safety might be seen as overstepping by the other if it's infringing on their autonomy. However, the author is coming from a place of love and fear. He's not the one taking risks; he's just the one who's worried. \n\nBut then, does he have the right to make her give up her career? It's her life and her choice. If he's not in a position where he's putting her at risk, maybe it's more about accepting her choices even if they make him uncomfortable. However, if the job is putting her in consistent danger, maybe he's justified in his concerns, but the way he's handling it might be the issue. It's causing fights and a rift, so perhaps he's not respecting her autonomy and the fact that she's already accepted the risks. \n\nOn the other hand, if the danger is extreme and she's being reckless, maybe he's not wrong. But the question is, is he the a**hole? The wife says he's being unfair and an a**hole. So maybe the answer hinges on whether the job is indeed as risky as he's making it out to be and if there's a way to find a compromise. For example, maybe she could take certain precautions, or he could try to cope with his anxiety without pressuring her to quit. \n\nIn many cases, the person who is in the dangerous job is the one making the choice, and the partner's role is to express concern but not to control the decision. So if the author is pushing her to quit without her consent, that might be seen as overreaching. But if he's just expressing his feelings and they can't find a middle ground, it's a tough spot. \n\nI think the author's intention is good\u2014he wants to protect her. But the outcome is that he's causing conflict by not letting her make her own decision. So maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong, because he's imposing his fears onto her career choice. But others might argue that he has the right to be concerned. However, the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) context usually looks at whether the person is being unreasonable. Since the wife already accepts the risks, he's not removing a danger but asking her to forgo her passion, which might make him the a**hole. But if the job is extremely dangerous and she's not acknowledging the risks, maybe he's right. The story says she's in a situation with antivenom available and she's working in a facility that's prepared. So the danger is managed, even if present. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong? Or is he? It's a bit of a toss-up. But in the AITA community, if someone is pressuring their partner to quit a job they love for the partner's emotional state, that's often considered the a**hole side. So maybe he's in the wrong (A), but some might see his fear as valid. The key is that the wife is making an informed decision, and the author's request is based on his own anxiety rather than actual danger. So, he's not wrong in his feelings, but in his action of insisting she quit. Therefore, AITA would probably lean towards him being the a**hole (A).\n"
