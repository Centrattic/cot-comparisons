She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The author's wife works with venomous animals, and she was bitten, which nearly killed her. He's worried about her safety and wants her to stop, but she's not budging. He's conflicted because he supports her passion but is terrified for her life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's concern is valid; no one wants their spouse to be in a life-threatening situation. It's natural for him to feel anxious and want to protect her. On the other hand, the wife has a passion for her work, which she worked hard to achieve. She sees her job as a noble cause, similar to first responders. She's willing to accept the risks because of the potential benefits of her research.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong for asking her to leave her job. Legally, he can't force her to quit unless there's some form of legal control, which there isn't in a marriage. Ethically, it's a gray area. Supporting each other's dreams is important in a marriage, but so is ensuring each other's safety. The husband is expressing his fear and concern, which is understandable. However, the wife has autonomy over her career choices. It's her life and her body, and while he can express his worries, he can't ethically demand she give up her job. \n\nBut maybe the husband is being unreasonable? If her job is her passion and she's aware of the risks, is he overstepping by trying to make that decision for her? The key here is autonomy versus safety concerns. The husband's love and fear are genuine, but the wife's right to pursue her career is also valid. The problem is they're at an impasse. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. The author is not in the wrong if we consider that he's acting out of love and concern. However, he's also trying to control her career choice, which could be seen as infringing on her autonomy. But since he's her spouse, his concern is from a place of care. It's a tough call. \n\nIn many relationships, partners do have to compromise. If the husband can't handle the stress and it's causing significant marital strain, maybe they need to find a middle ground. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not forcing her and is expressing his feelings, maybe he's not wrong. However, he's not respecting her autonomy by not accepting her choice. So it's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because his intentions are good, but there's a valid argument for A (in the wrong) because he's not respecting her autonomy. But in reality, this is a complex situation where both have valid points. However, since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and considering that he's expressing his feelings and trying to protect her, the answer might be B. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe some would say A because he's trying to control her career. Hmm.\n"
