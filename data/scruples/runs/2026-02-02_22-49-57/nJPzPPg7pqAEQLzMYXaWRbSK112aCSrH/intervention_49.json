She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The question is asking for a judgment between options A (Yes) and B (No).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife works with venomous animals, which is risky. She was almost killed by a snake bite but recovered. The husband is concerned about her safety and wants her to stop working with these animals. The wife is passionate about her work and refuses to quit. They're having arguments, and the husband is seeking validation on whether he's wrong.\n\nThe husband's main argument is that he loves her and wants her to be safe. The wife argues that it's her dream job and she accepts the risks because she's saving lives. The husband can't accept the risk even if others do, like police or firefighters.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The wife's autonomy is a key factor here. She's an adult, has her own career, and made a choice she's passionate about. The husband's concern is valid, as he's worried about her safety, but he's trying to impose his will on her career decisions. That could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. However, his motivation comes from love and care.\n\nBut then, the balance between supporting her dreams and protecting her life. If the job is extremely dangerous and could lead to her death, the husband's fear is understandable. Yet, he's not forcing her directly but is requesting she stop, which she refuses. The question is whether his request is reasonable.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's willingness to accept risks for her passion is a personal choice. The husband might think that the risk is too high for him to handle emotionally, which is his personal limit. However, is it his place to decide her career path? That's where the conflict lies.\n\nIn relationships, partners often have to compromise. But in this case, the husband isn't compromising; he wants her to give up her job, and she isn't. The fact that she chose this path and is aware of the risks suggests that the husband's insistence might be overstepping. He could be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy despite his concerns.\n\nBut if the risk is extreme and she's not considering the danger, maybe the husband has some valid ground. However, the wife was already injured and chose to go back, so she's made that choice. The husband's role is supportive, not controlling. So, perhaps the husband is in the wrong because he's trying to control her career decisions despite her autonomy and her acceptance of the risks.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's overriding her career choices based on his fears, even though she's made her own decision to accept the risks for her passion. The key point is respecting her autonomy versus his concern. Since she's an adult and the job is her choice, even if it's dangerous, he's not in the right to demand she quit.\n"
