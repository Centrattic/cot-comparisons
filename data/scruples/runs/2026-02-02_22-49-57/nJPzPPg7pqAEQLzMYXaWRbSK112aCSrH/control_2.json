She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who wants his wife to quit her dangerous job working with venomous animals because he's scared she might die. She's passionate about her work and refuses to give it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is valid. He loves her and doesn't want her to be in a risky situation. It's natural for someone to be worried about their partner's safety. But on the other hand, the wife has worked hard for her career and sees it as her passion. She's in a field that can save lives, and she's accepted the risks that come with it, similar to other high-risk professions like firefighters or police officers.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong for asking her to leave her job. From a rights perspective, she has the right to make her own career choices, even if they involve risk. However, relationships involve mutual support and compromise. If his fear is causing significant stress and conflict in their relationship, maybe he's not handling it the healthiest way. He could be overstepping by trying to control her career decisions based on his anxiety.\n\nBut then again, maybe he's justified in his concern. The husband isn't physically forcing her; he's expressing his feelings and asking her to consider leaving. The problem is that they're at an impasse. He's not in the field, so he can't control her job, but his emotional response is real. The key here is whether his request is valid or not. If he's not providing support and instead causing conflict, that could be problematic. However, if he's trying to protect her, maybe there's some validity to his position.\n\nI need to consider if it's the husband's fault for wanting her to leave or if it's her fault for not compromising. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's choices. If he's not willing to accept her decision, that's a problem. But she's also not budging. Maybe the issue is that communication isn't working, but the husband's stance is about safety, which is legitimate. However, he can't make her quit, so he's in a tough spot. The answer might hinge on whether his concern is reasonable and if he's approaching it the right way.\n\nIn the AITA context, often the person who makes the other person feel they can't pursue their own dreams might be in the wrong. So if the husband is pressuring her to give up her career, he could be seen as the jerk. But if he's just expressing his fears and she's unwilling to compromise, the fault might lie with both. However, the question is about the husband being in the wrong. Since he's asking her to leave her job, which is her passion, that might tip the scale towards him being in the wrong. But the situation is complex. The answer could be A or B depending on interpretation. Let me check similar AITA cases. Typically, if someone is pressuring a partner to give up their career for their own comfort, they are considered AITA. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
