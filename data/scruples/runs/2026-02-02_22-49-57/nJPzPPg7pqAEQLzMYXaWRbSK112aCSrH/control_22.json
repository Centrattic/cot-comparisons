She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to quit her dangerous job. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the wife's job is in biomedical research, specifically with venomous animals. She's been in the field for a long time and has a passion for it. The author mentions she almost died from a snake bite but went back to work quickly. He's struggling with the risk involved and wants her to stop for her safety. She's resistant, comparing her job to careers like firefighters or police officers where risks are inherent.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether wanting your spouse to give up a dangerous but meaningful job is wrong. The author's concern is valid because he's worried about her safety. But is it his place to make that decision for her? On the other hand, the wife is an adult and has the right to choose her career, especially if she's aware of the risks and they're part of the job description.\n\nThe author hasn't forced her to quit, just expressed his wishes. He supports her in other aspects, which is important. However, her job is a significant part of her identity and passion. The husband's fear might be causing stress in the relationship, but does that make him wrong? It's a balance between personal safety and personal freedom.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether it's reasonable to ask someone to give up their career. While the husband's fear is understandable, if she's taking necessary precautions (like having antivenom) and it's a legitimate job with accepted risks, the husband's request might be overstepping. The wife's autonomy is important. So, maybe the author is in the wrong (A) because he's trying to control her career choice, even if his intentions are good. But there's nuance here. Alternatively, if he's just expressing his feelings and not forcing her, maybe not (B). \n\nWait, the key point is whether he's in the wrong. The question is about if he's the jerk. The wife's argument is that he's being unfair. If the husband is trying to impose his fears on her decisions, that could be seen as wrong. However, if he's just sharing his concerns and the wife is choosing to ignore them, then both have valid points. But in terms of being in the wrong, he's not forcing her, just asking. The answer might be B (not wrong) because he's expressing his feelings, even if it's causing conflict. But the wife is also right to defend her career. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but they're both at fault? The question is whether he is in the wrong. The user asks for a binary answer. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because he's not wrong for caring about her safety. But if the job is inherently risky and she's aware, he can't force her to stop. However, in the AITA context, sometimes the husband is seen as wrong for trying to control her. Hmm. I'm a bit torn. But considering she's an adult and he's not blocking her from the job, maybe he's not wrong. So B.\n"
