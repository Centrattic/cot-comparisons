She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. So, the wife works with venomous animals in research, which is risky. She got bitten and almost died, but she went back to work. The husband is really worried and wants her to stop, while she argues it's her passion and she's in a field that saves lives.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern for his wife's safety is valid. Any parent or spouse would worry about their loved one being in a dangerous job. He's not directly forcing her; he's asking her to quit. But the wife has a right to her career and her autonomy. She's making an informed choice, even though it's risky. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. It's a matter of personal choice vs. concern for safety. In many cases, people have the right to take risks in their jobs, as long as they're aware of the dangers. The husband is expressing his fear and trying to protect her, which is understandable. However, he can't force her to stop, and if she's not in immediate danger anymore (since the facility has antivenom), maybe his request is overstepping.\n\nThe wife's job is her passion and she's achieved a lot. Denying her that for his own anxiety might not be fair. At the same time, he's her husband and wants to protect her. The key point is consent and mutual respect. If she's making an informed decision and the risks are managed, he might not be in the wrong for expressing his concerns, but he can't make her quit. The answer might depend on whether he's respecting her autonomy while voicing his worries. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for caring, but he is if he's pressuring her to give up her career against her will. Since the situation is a stalemate and he's seeking advice, the answer is likely B (he's not in the wrong) because wanting to protect his wife isn't inherently wrong, even if he's not making her do it.\n"
