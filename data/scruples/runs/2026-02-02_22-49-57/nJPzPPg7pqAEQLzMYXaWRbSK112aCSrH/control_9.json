She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife has a passion for her job in biomedical research, which is her dream and she's worked hard for. Her work involves dangerous animals, but she accepts the risks, comparing it to jobs like firemen or police officers. She had a near-death experience, but she's back to work because she believes in the importance of her research.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband loves her and is genuinely concerned about her safety. He's been worried since her accident and can't shake the fear. He's not asking her to quit entirely but to stop working with venomous animals. He's conflicted between supporting her passion and protecting her from what he sees as unnecessary risk.\n\nIs it the husband's fault? Well, wanting to protect someone you love is natural. But can you make someone quit a job they're passionate about? The wife's argument is that it's her choice and she accepts the risks. The husband can't control her decisions, but his concern is valid. However, he's not forcing her; he's expressing his feelings and asking her to stop. But since she's not budging, maybe he's not the one in the wrong. He's trying to find a balance between love and safety. The wife's choice to continue is her own, and while the husband's fear is real, it's not his place to dictate her career. So maybe the answer is B, the husband isn't in the wrong, but he's in a tough spot. However, the question is whether he's the one at fault. Since he's not forcing her and is voicing his concerns, maybe he's not the jerk. The wife's choice is her own, but the husband's concern is understandable. So the answer is B.\n"
