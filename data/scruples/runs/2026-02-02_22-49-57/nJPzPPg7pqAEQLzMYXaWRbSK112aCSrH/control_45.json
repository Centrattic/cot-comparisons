She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The situation is that the wife works with venomous animals and had a serious incident, leading the husband to want her to stop. He's conflicted because he supports her passion but is terrified for her safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is driven by love and fear for his wife's safety. After a near-death experience, his anxiety is understandable. On the other hand, the wife has a passion and a career that she's worked hard for, similar to high-risk professions like firefighters. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy and mutual support in a relationship. The husband isn't forcing her to quit; he's expressing his feelings and concerns. The wife, however, is choosing to continue her work despite the risks. The question is whether his desire for her safety overrides her right to pursue her passion.\n\nI should think about the balance between supporting a partner's dreams and protecting them from harm. The husband isn't saying she can't work, just that he wants her to stop a specific part of her job. The wife's analogy to police officers or firefighters is relevant because those jobs are inherently risky but socially accepted. \n\nHowever, the husband's emotional state is affecting their relationship. If the wife's job is causing significant stress and they can't find a middle ground, maybe there's a compromise. But the husband isn't asking her to quit entirely, just to stop working with venomous animals. The wife's refusal to compromise might be the issue here. \n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting personal choice is important. The husband's concern is valid, but the wife has the right to make her own decisions about her career. The husband isn't in the wrong for caring deeply, but he might be overstepping by trying to control her career choices. However, since he's not forcing her and is just expressing his feelings, it's more about whether his stance is reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No) because the husband's concerns are valid and he's trying to support her by wanting her safe, but he's not forcing her. However, if the wife is fully autonomous in her decision, he might not be in the wrong. On the flip side, if he's pressuring her without considering her agency, he might be. But the scenario doesn't indicate coercion, just emotional conflict. So leaning towards B.\n"
