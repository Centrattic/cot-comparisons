She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband loves his wife and supports her in general, but he's genuinely worried about her safety after she was bitten and almost died. His concern is understandable because he's her partner and wants her safe. On the other hand, the wife has a passion for her work in a biomedical field, which has risks, but she's accepted those risks, similar to someone in law enforcement or firefighting.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy vs. safety. The wife has the right to pursue her career, even if it's risky. The husband's role is to support her, but he's struggling with the emotional toll of her job. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting her to quit. \n\nLegally and ethically, a person can't be forced to quit their job unless it's against the law or they're endangering others, which isn't the case here. The wife is making a conscious choice, even with the risks. The husband's request is based on his emotional and safety concerns, but that doesn't override her autonomy. \n\nHowever, relationships involve compromise. The husband isn't forcing her; he's expressing his feelings and asking her to consider his perspective. The wife is also not budging, so there's a stalemate. But is he wrong for having this request? It's complicated. His intentions are protective, but he's not making her quit. The problem is the conflict between their priorities. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, supporting a partner's career is generally encouraged unless there's clear harm. Since the wife's job is legal and she's aware of the risks, the husband's concern is valid, but his request might be seen as overstepping because he's not the one at risk. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the husband's stance is understandable, but asking his wife to give up her career is where the conflict lies. He's not in the wrong because he's acting out of love and fear, but the wife's right to her career is also significant. However, since he's not forcing her and is trying to communicate his feelings, it's a matter of differing priorities rather than a clear moral wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
