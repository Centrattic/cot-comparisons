She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting their wife to give up her dangerous dream job. The scenario involves a wife who works with venomous animals and a husband who's concerned about her safety after she was bitten. They're at an impasse, and he's wondering if he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is worried about her safety, which is a valid concern. He loves her and wants to protect her. On the other hand, the wife has a passion for her work in biomedical research, which could lead to important medical advancements. She's already faced a life-threatening situation but is committed to her field. \n\nI should think about the dynamics of their relationship. The husband mentioned he's supported her before, only now becoming more insistent after her injury. Is his concern justified? It's true that some jobs have inherent risks, like police or firefighters, and people accept those risks. But the husband isn't asking her to leave her job entirely, just to stop working with venomous animals. Is that a reasonable request?\n\nOn the flip side, the wife's career is her passion, and she's made significant achievements. Forcing her to quit could be seen as undermining her autonomy and personal goals. However, the husband's fear stems from love and a desire to protect her. It's a tough balance between supporting a partner's dreams and ensuring their safety.\n\nI need to check if there are any red flags. The husband didn't force her before, only after the incident. Maybe he's overreacting out of trauma. But he's not violent or controlling; he's expressing his fears. The wife might feel that his new stance is unfair, especially if he didn't raise it earlier. However, his concern is real and valid.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often support each other's careers even with risks. But when it comes to extreme dangers, it's more complex. The key is whether the husband is being overbearing or if it's a mutual discussion. Since he's not controlling her but wants her to quit, it might cross into being in the wrong if it's infringing on her autonomy without mutual agreement.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the husband's request is reasonable. Since the job is inherently risky and she's aware, he can't control her choices. But he's entitled to his feelings. However, pushing her to quit might not be fair. The question is if he's wrong for making that demand. Given that it's her career and she's accepted the risks, the husband might be in the wrong by not respecting her choice despite his fears. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's imposing his fears onto her decisions.\n"
