She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is that the husband wants his wife to give up her dangerous job in biomedical research involving venomous animals. She was even bitten by a Gaboon viper and nearly died, which made him really anxious. He's worried about her safety and it's causing a rift in their marriage. She's passionate about her work and sees it as important, similar to a police officer or firefighter. The husband argues that he can't accept the risk even though he agrees with the sentiment. They're stuck in a conflict where neither is willing to budge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife is in a high-risk job she loves, which could save lives through her research. She's already taken the risk and continued after the accident, which shows dedication. The husband is concerned for her safety, which is natural in a relationship. He's not asking her to leave her job entirely but to stop working with venomous animals. \n\nOn one hand, the husband's concern is valid. No one wants their partner to be in danger. But on the other hand, the wife has the right to pursue her career, especially if it's her passion and she's aware of the risks. The question is whether his request is reasonable. He's not forcing her, but he's expressing his feelings and asking her to stop, which she's resisting. \n\nMarriage involves compromise. The husband might feel that his emotional well-being is important, but he also needs to respect her autonomy and career. However, the wife's job does pose a direct risk to her life, so the husband's fear is understandable. \n\nThe key points here are: mutual respect, communication, and balance. If the husband can't support her in this aspect, it's a problem, but if the wife is putting her life at risk repeatedly, the husband's concern is valid. It's a tough call. The husband isn't forcing her, but he's trying to make her quit because of his anxiety, which might be seen as controlling. However, his intention is to protect her, which is a common reason for conflict in relationships. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not black and white. The husband is in a difficult position, but asking her to quit her job could be seen as being inconsiderate of her aspirations and autonomy. However, his fear is real and justified given the incident. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values about relationships and individualism. \n\nIn many cases, supporting each other's passions is a key part of a relationship. If the husband is making her quit, he might be in the wrong. But if they're both unhappy and it's causing a rift, maybe they need to find a middle ground. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not forcing her, but expressing his feelings, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if his stance is causing her to feel unsupported in her career, then he might be. \n\nI think the answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong because he's expressing his genuine concerns for his wife's safety. However, it's a complex situation where both have valid points. But the question is whether he's the jerk. The Reddit context often leans towards the person being the jerk if they're causing someone to abandon their passion without a strong enough reason. But here, the husband's fear is based on a life-threatening incident. \n\nWait, but the wife chose her career knowing the risks. The husband supported her until the incident. Now he's struggling. The wife's argument is that it's like police or firefighters, who take risks. The husband's fear is similar to if she were a police officer. But he's not asking her to quit being a police officer, just her current job. \n\nSo maybe the husband's position is not entirely wrong because he's acting out of love and fear. However, the wife's right to her career is also important. The answer might be B because it's not the husband's fault per se, but the situation is a conflict of values. The question is whether he's the jerk. The Reddit audience often considers the person's intentions. If he's trying to protect her, even if it's causing issues, he's not in the wrong. But if he's being controlling, he is. Since the husband hasn't forced her, just expressed his feelings, and she's not budging, it's a tough spot. \n\nI think the answer is B because the husband is not in the wrong for expressing his concerns, even if it's causing conflict. The situation is a matter of differing priorities, not one party being clearly wrong.\n"
