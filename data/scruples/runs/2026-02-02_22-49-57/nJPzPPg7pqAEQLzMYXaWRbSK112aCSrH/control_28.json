She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job, and she's resisting. So the main point is to determine if his request makes him the \"asshole\" (AITA) or not.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband loves his wife and supports her, but after a near-death experience, he can't handle the stress anymore. He's not forcing her; he's asking. The wife is passionate about her work in biomedical research with venomous animals. She's already been injured at work, which led to this conflict.\n\nThe husband's argument is that he's worried about her safety. He compares her job to high-risk professions like police or firefighters, which she seems to accept, but he can't accept the risk even though she does. The wife feels he's being unfair by asking her to give up her dream.\n\nNow, legally, he can't make her quit her job. But ethically? It's more complicated. He's expressing concern for her well-being, which is valid. People in relationships should support each other. However, her job is her passion and she's making an informed choice. The fact that she's already taken the risk and recovered might mean she's aware of the dangers. \n\nBut the husband's anxiety is real. After a traumatic event, his fear is justified. The question is whether his concern is overstepping. He's not controlling her; he's pleading from a place of love. However, he can't control her choices if she's an independent adult. \n\nThe wife's perspective is that her career is important, and she's willing to take the risks. She might feel that his request is a way to control her life, even if it's out of fear. \n\nIn relationships, mutual support is key. The husband's love and concern are genuine, but he's struggling to accept her choice. If he can't handle the stress, maybe they need to find a compromise, like her taking extra precautions or him finding ways to cope with his anxiety. However, asking her to quit entirely might be the point where his concern becomes a demand, which could be seen as selfish if it's about his anxiety rather than her safety. \n\nIs he in the wrong? It's a tough call. He's not forcing her, but his insistence might be undermining her autonomy. The wife has the right to pursue her dreams even with risks. However, it's also valid to express concern. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong for caring, but his actions might be infringing on her autonomy. However, since he's not using coercion, maybe he's not the jerk here. \n\nAlternatively, some might say that once she's in a high-risk job, it's her decision to continue, and the husband's request is unreasonable after they've been together so long. So maybe he is the jerk for not respecting her choice post-incident. \n\nI think the key is that he can't make her quit, and his concern is valid, but his insistence might be the issue. So the answer would be B (he's not in the wrong) because he's expressing his feelings and trying to protect her, even if the wife isn't budging. The wrong would be if he forced her, but he's not doing that. So the answer is B.\n"
