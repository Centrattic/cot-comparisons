She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the husband is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, the wife's job involves working with venomous animals, which is inherently risky. She was bitten and nearly died, which is a significant event. The husband is concerned for her safety, which is understandable. He's not just being a worrywart; he's reacting to a real, life-threatening situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is passionate about her work and it's her dream job. She works in a field that could lead to medical advancements. She compares it to high-risk professions like police or firefighters, who are generally accepted for the risks they take. The husband acknowledges her point but still can't get over the fear of her getting hurt again.\n\nThe key points here are consent, mutual respect, and the balance between personal safety and career fulfillment. The husband isn't forcing her, but he's expressing his concerns. The wife is choosing to continue despite the risks, which she's aware of. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's goals unless there's a compelling reason to intervene. However, the husband's fear is stemming from a traumatic event. The question is whether his request crosses the line from concern into being controlling. \n\nThe husband isn't asking her to quit entirely but to stop handling venomous animals. If he's supportive in other ways (like emotionally or financially) but is pressuring her to change her job duties, that could be a problem. However, if he's just expressing his feelings and not forcing her, maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nThe wife's argument is that it's unfair to ask her to give up her passion. Her job has purpose beyond just her safety; it's contributing to science. The husband's stance is valid due to the risks, but he's not the one taking those risks. \n\nSo, it's a tough call. Both have valid points. But the husband is not the one endangered, and her choice is her personal decision. He's voicing his concerns, which he's entitled to, but if he's pressuring her beyond that, maybe he's overstepping. But since he's not forcing her, it's a matter of whether his feelings are enough to justify his request. \n\nIn the end, since the wife is an adult and making an informed choice, the husband's request doesn't necessarily make him the jerk. He's not causing harm, just expressing fear. However, if he's being manipulative or controlling, that's different. But based on the story, he's just not able to support her anymore because of the risk, which is a personal struggle, not necessarily a wrong one.\n"
