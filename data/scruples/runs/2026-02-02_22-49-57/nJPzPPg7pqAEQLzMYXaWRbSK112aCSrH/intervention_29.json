She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author wants his wife to quit her dangerous job. She works with venomous animals and had a near-death experience. He's worried about her safety, but she's passionate about her job and won't quit. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's concern is valid. He loves his wife and doesn't want her to risk her life. It's natural to feel that way when a spouse's job is dangerous. He's not forcing her, just asking her to stop. On the other hand, she has a right to pursue her passion and career. Her job has risks, but so do other jobs like police or firefighting, which she compares it to. She's accepted the risks, and the author seems to agree with the sentiment but can't accept the danger.\n\nIs it wrong to want her to quit? Well, he's not controlling her, just expressing his fears. However, he's making a request based on his own anxiety, which might not be fair. The wife has a right to her career, and the author's fear might be infringing on her autonomy. But he's also trying to protect her, which is a valid concern. The line here is whether his request is overstepping. Since he's not forcing her, maybe he's not in the wrong. But is it his place to ask her to give up her job? It's a tough balance between care and control.\n\nIn relationships, partners should support each other's goals. However, safety is also important. If the job is extremely risky, the author has a reason to be worried. The wife went back to work after a serious incident, which might make the author feel helpless. The author's actions are coming from a place of love and fear, not malice. But he's not respecting her choice. So, is he in the wrong? Maybe partially, but the situation is complex. The answer could be B, but there are nuances.\n"
