She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The author's wife works with venomous animals and had a near-death experience. He's supportive but now feels he can't handle the risk anymore, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern for his wife's safety is valid. Any parent or partner would worry about someone close to them being in a life-threatening job. His feelings of stress and fear are understandable after such an incident. He's not asking her to quit entirely, just to stop working with the dangerous animals, which might still allow her to do research in a safer capacity.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife has a passion for her career, which she's worked hard to achieve. She's made a comparison to high-risk jobs like police or firefighters, which society generally respects despite the dangers. She's also in a position where her work can save lives through research, which adds another layer of moral reasoning. Her perspective is about personal fulfillment and contribution to science.\n\nThe key here is whether the husband's request is overstepping. He's not forcing her; he's expressing his feelings and trying to communicate his boundaries. However, the wife is firm in her stance. The question is whether it's reasonable for him to ask for this given the circumstances. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is crucial. While the husband has valid fears, the wife's autonomy and career choice are also important. It's a conflict between personal safety and personal passion. Legally, he can't force her to quit, but in terms of being in the wrong, it's about whether his request is reasonable. \n\nSince he's not being controlling or abusive, just expressing his concerns, perhaps he's not in the wrong. But some might argue that he needs to accept her choice as part of supporting her. However, given the severity of the incident, his stance is more about protecting her, which is a natural instinct. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation where both have valid points.\n"
