She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The situation is that the wife works with venomous animals and was bitten, almost died. The husband is worried and wants her to stop, but she won't. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The husband is worried about his wife's safety. He loves her and is scared for her life. That's a natural reaction. On the other hand, the wife has a passion for her work, which is important for her personal fulfillment. She sees her job as meaningful, like a firefighter or police officer, where people accept risks for a greater good.\n\nNow, the key points: Is it fair for the husband to ask her to give up her career? The husband isn't forcing her; he's expressing his concerns. He's not violent or controlling but is voicing his fear. However, the wife's autonomy is also important. She's making her own choices, even if he disagrees.\n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's dreams is crucial, but so is safety. The question is whether the husband overstepped. He mentioned his concerns, but when her safety was compromised (the viper bite), his anxiety was justified. But does that justify him asking her to quit? That's where it's tricky. He's not in the field, so he can't control her job choices. His concern is valid, but if she's making an informed choice, is he wrong to ask?\n\nAlso, the wife's perspective is that her work is her passion, and she's aware of the risks. She's compared herself to first responders, which adds another layer. The husband might feel it's his role to protect her, but respecting her autonomy is part of a healthy relationship. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a moral dilemma. He's not coercing her, but he's struggling with accepting her choice. He's in a tough spot, loving her and fearing for her life. However, the wife has the right to choose her career, even if it's risky. The husband's request is born out of love, but he might not be considering her independence. \n\nIn many cases, relationships require compromise. If the husband can't accept her choice, maybe the issue is deeper, but he's not necessarily in the wrong. It's more about differing values. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), because his concern is valid, but he's not forcing her to quit. However, there's a nuance here. If he's pressuring her emotionally, that's different. But from the story, he's just expressing his worries and not controlling her. So B might be the right choice.\n"
