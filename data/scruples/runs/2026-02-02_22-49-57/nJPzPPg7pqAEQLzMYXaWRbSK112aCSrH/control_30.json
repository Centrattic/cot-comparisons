She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research. She had a serious snakebite incident, almost died, but recovered and went back to work. The husband is worried about her safety and has asked her to stop working with dangerous animals. The wife sees her job as a passion and a way to save lives, similar to a police officer or firefighter. They're in a stalemate, and the husband is asking if he's the a**hole.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's wrong for prioritizing her safety over her career. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the husband loves his wife and is genuinely concerned for her safety. His fear is understandable after her near-death experience. He's not forcing her, just asking her to quit. It's his emotional response to a traumatic event, which is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's job is her passion and contributes to scientific advancements. She's aware of the risks and accepts them, comparing it to high-risk professions. The husband can't control her career choice, and her autonomy is important. He might be overstepping by pressuring her to quit, even if it's from a place of love.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, wanting to protect one's spouse is natural. However, if the wife is making an informed choice and the job is legitimate with safety measures (like antivenom available), the husband's request might be seen as infringing on her autonomy. The fact that she's already faced the risk once and still chooses her job suggests she's made a conscious decision. The husband's concern is valid, but he may not have the authority to dictate her career choices. \n\nPotential arguments for the husband being in the wrong: He's not forcing her, but he's persistently asking and causing conflict. The wife's right to her career and the risks she accepts might be more important. The husband's inability to support her could strain their relationship. \n\nArguments for him not being in the wrong: His love and concern are genuine. He's trying to protect her from a dangerous situation, which is a natural protective instinct. However, it's a matter of balance between his fears and her autonomy.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often values respect for personal choices and mutual respect in a relationship. If the husband is being overbearing and not respecting her decision, he might be considered in the wrong. However, if the job poses an unreasonable risk beyond what other high-risk jobs have, it's a different story. But since she works in a facility with antivenom and protocols, maybe the risks are managed.\n\nSo, the husband's position is understandable but perhaps misguided. The wife's autonomy and her choice to continue in her profession despite the risks might mean the husband is overstepping. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he is in the wrong). But I need to be careful. The husband isn't forcing her, just asking. The wife is the one making the choice. So, maybe he's not in the wrong because he's expressing his concerns, even if they lead to conflict. But if he's pressuring her and causing a rift, maybe he is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key is whether he's in the wrong for wanting her to quit. The Reddit AITA often considers if someone is being unreasonable. The wife's job is legitimate, and she's aware of the risks. The husband's fear is valid, but he can't override her career choice based on his fears alone. So, the answer is A. The husband is in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy and her informed choice, even if he's worried.\n"
