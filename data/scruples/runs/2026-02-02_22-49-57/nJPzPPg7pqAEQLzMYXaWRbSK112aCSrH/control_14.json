She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote this Reddit post is the asshole for wanting his wife to give up her dream job in a dangerous field.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research. She had a serious incident where she was bitten and almost died. The husband is now asking her to stop working with these animals. She's passionate about her job and sees it as a noble pursuit, similar to a police officer or firefighter taking risks. The husband is worried about her safety and can't handle the stress anymore. They've had fights and it's causing a rift.\n\nSo, the key points here are: her job is dangerous, she loves it and sees it as important, he's scared for her life, and he's asking her to quit. The question is whether he's wrong for doing that.\n\nOn one hand, the husband's concern for his wife's safety is valid. No one wants their partner to be harmed. His fear after she almost died is understandable. He's trying to protect her. But on the other hand, the wife has a right to pursue her passion and career, especially if she's making informed choices about the risks. Comparing her job to police or firefighting, which are high-risk but respected professions, might be a valid comparison. She's aware of the risks and has made the choice to accept them, just like those in other high-risk professions.\n\nThe husband is putting pressure on her to change her career, which is a fundamental part of her identity and happiness. Even if it's out of love, is it fair for him to ask her to give that up? It could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. However, the concern for her safety is genuine. It's a tough balance between personal safety and personal freedom.\n\nI should also consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe they can find ways to mitigate the risks without her quitting entirely. But the husband isn't open to that, and the wife isn't budging either. The fact that she went back to work immediately after the incident shows her commitment to her job. The husband is struggling to support her, which he said he always wanted to do. There's a conflict between his emotional response and her career choice.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's generally expected that partners support each other's ambitions, even if they have concerns. However, when the concerns are about safety, it's a different angle. The line between support and overstepping can be blurry. If the husband is making her quit, that's a direct infringement on her choices. But if he's just expressing his fears and not forcing her, maybe it's different. The post says he's asked her to stop, which implies pressure.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the husband's intentions might be good, but his actions are infringing on her autonomy. The wife has a right to make her own decisions about risk, especially in a job she loves that contributes positively. The husband's fear might be irrational, but it's real for him. However, the fact that she's in a high-risk job that's her passion, and he's asking her to quit without compromise, could make him the one in the wrong. The answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong), but I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing.\n"
