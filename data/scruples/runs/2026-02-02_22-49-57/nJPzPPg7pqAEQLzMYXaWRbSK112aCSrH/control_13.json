She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The wife has a job in biomedical research with venomous animals, which is risky. She's passionate about it and it's her dream job. The husband is concerned for her safety after she was bitten and almost died. He wants her to stop working with the venomous animals, but she's not willing to give up her career.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's clearly worried about her safety. It's natural for a spouse to want their partner safe. However, the wife has her own autonomy and career. The husband's request might be seen as overstepping if she didn't agree to the risks with him. But he hasn't forced her; he's just making his concerns known. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife chose her career path and is aware of the risks. She even compares her job to that of a police officer or firefighter, which are also high-risk. The husband's issue isn't with her career choice itself but with the specific dangers. But he's not asking her to quit entirely, just to stop working with venomous animals. \n\nThe key here is whether the husband has the right to dictate her career choices. While his concerns are valid, he can't force her to stop. The fact that they had a major incident (the viper bite) has probably increased his anxiety. However, the wife's autonomy is important. She has the right to pursue her passion even if it comes with risks. \n\nBut does that make the husband wrong for expressing his desire for her to stop? Maybe not. He's in a difficult position, trying to balance his love for her and his fear for her safety. However, the way he's approaching it might be the problem. Instead of demanding she quit, maybe he should focus on finding compromises or ways to mitigate the risks. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not forcing her and is communicating his feelings, perhaps he's not in the wrong for expressing his concerns. But if he's pressuring her to quit, that's another angle. The wife has her own rights and dreams. The husband might not be in the wrong for caring, but he might be overstepping by trying to control her career. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often have differing opinions. Some might say the husband is being overprotective, others might see it as loving. The wife's choice to continue despite the risks is her right. The husband's stance isn't necessarily wrong, but the conflict arises from clashing values. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on how one views personal autonomy versus spousal concern. If the husband is respecting her decision and just stating his perspective without forcing her, he's not in the wrong. However, if he's pressuring her to change her career, that could be seen as wrong. The scenario says they've hit a wall and neither is budging. The husband is asking for opinions, so maybe he's looking for validation. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having concerns, but the key is whether he's respecting her autonomy. Since he's not forcing her, but expressing his feelings, he might not be in the wrong. However, the wife is also in the right to pursue her career. The situation is complex, but the husband's position isn't clearly wrong.\n"
