She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this Reddit post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author's wife works with venomous animals in her research, which is her dream job. She had a serious incident where she was bitten by a Gaboon viper and almost died. The author is now asking her to stop working with dangerous animals, which she refuses to do. They're in a conflict, and the author is worried about her safety but feels bad because she's passionate about her work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author mentions they've been together for almost ten years, married for about five. He loves her and wants to support her, but this job poses a significant risk. He tried to support her initially but is now struggling due to the near-death experience. His request is for her to stop working with venomous animals, which she sees as her passion and a way to save lives.\n\nIs his request reasonable? On one hand, he's concerned for her safety, which is a valid and caring motivation. On the other hand, he's asking her to give up her career and passion, which is a major life decision. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's choices and safety. However, the author isn't forcing her but is making a heartfelt plea based on love and fear. She's not budging, so it's a mutual impasse.\n\nAre there other factors? The wife's job is in a field that inherently carries risks, similar to other high-risk professions. The author might feel that the risk is too high compared to other jobs. But is it his place to decide that? While he can express his concerns, pushing her to leave her career could be seen as controlling unless they can find a compromise, like her taking additional safety measures or finding a less dangerous role within her field.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's being supportive but has a legitimate fear for her safety, it's not necessarily wrong to express his concerns. However, if he's pressuring her to quit without offering alternatives or understanding her perspective, that could be problematic. The wife's perspective is also important\u2014she sees her work as meaningful and is willing to accept the risks, which is her right. \n\nIn relationships, partners should respect each other's autonomy and passions. The author is trying to protect her, but he might not be considering her autonomy enough. If he's not willing to accept the risks but can't accept her staying in her job, maybe they need to find another solution together. But is that making him the jerk? It's a tough spot. He's acting out of love and fear, which are genuine emotions. However, the wife is also in her right to pursue her dream. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. The author is not in the wrong for caring and wanting her to be safe. However, he might not be in the right if he's not respecting her agency. The answer could be B (not in the wrong), but maybe with some caveats. However, the user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, and the answer should be B.\n"
