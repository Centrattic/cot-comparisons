She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether he's being unreasonable by asking his wife to quit her dangerous job.\n\nFirst, the wife's job is in the biomedical field, working with venomous animals. She's had a serious incident\u2014bitten by a Gaboon viper, which almost killed her. The husband is worried about her safety and wants her to stop working with these animals. She's passionate about her work, compares it to police or firefighters, and isn't willing to quit.\n\nThe husband has supported her all this time but now, after the life-threatening incident, he's struggling. They're in a stalemate. The wife says he's being unfair, but he's asking if he's the jerk here.\n\nSo, what's the key here? On one hand, the husband's concern for his wife's safety is valid. It's natural to want to protect the person you love. But on the other hand, the wife has a right to pursue her career, especially if she's aware of the risks and the work contributes to saving lives. \n\nThe problem is that the husband didn't object before, even though he had some worries. Now, after a dangerous incident, he's suddenly asking her to quit. The wife might feel that he's not considering her passions and the importance of her work. \n\nBut then again, after a near-death experience, his fear is justified. However, is it his place to make that decision for her? He can express his concerns and maybe discuss ways to mitigate risks, but can he ethically demand she quit? The wife's autonomy is a big factor here. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is important. The husband supports her in most things, but this is a major issue. If he's not willing to let her continue, maybe they need to find a compromise. But outright telling her to quit could be seen as overstepping, especially if she's content with the risks. \n\nHowever, the husband's fear is real and justified by the near-death experience. The question is whether his request is unreasonable. The wife argues that he's unfair, but he's coming from a place of love and concern. \n\nSo, who's in the wrong? It's a tough call. The husband's actions are driven by fear and wanting to protect her, but the wife's right to her career is also important. Since the husband didn't raise this before and only after the incident, it might be seen as him not respecting her choices, thus making him in the wrong. But if he's genuinely scared for her life, maybe he's not the jerk. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because his concern is valid, but he's not forcing her; he's just expressing his feelings. However, the wife's autonomy is key, so maybe the husband is in the wrong (A). But I'm not sure. The line between concern and controlling is thin.\n"
