She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he wants his wife to give up her dream job in the biomedical field involving venomous animals because it's dangerous. She was bitten and almost died, which made him more worried. They're fighting about it, and he's asking if he's the a**hole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife has a passion for her job and it's a significant part of her identity, especially since she worked hard to get there. Her work could save lives, which is a noble cause. She's also in a controlled environment where they have antivenom, so maybe the risks are managed. On the other hand, the husband is genuinely scared for her safety after a near-death experience. His concern is about her well-being, which is valid, but he's asking her to quit something she loves.\n\nIs it fair for him to make that request? Well, he's not forcing her, just expressing his feelings. However, her job is legal and she's aware of the risks. Partners should support each other's goals unless there's a compelling reason. But maybe he's not in the wrong because his anxiety is causing a rift. The question is whether it's reasonable for him to ask her to stop. \n\nBut then again, she chose her career path and understands the dangers. Maybe he's overstepping by trying to control her career. However, the husband's support is important in a relationship, and if her job is causing severe stress and potential harm, his concern is understandable. The key point is that he's not in a position to make that decision for her. So, the answer might depend on whether the husband's request is reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nWait, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But is he being selfish? He wants her to quit her dream job for his emotional well-being. That could be seen as selfish, even if his intentions are good. The wife is in a high-risk job, but she's accepted the risks. The husband's fear might be irrational, but it's causing problems. It's a tough balance between supporting her passion and protecting her. Maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy and choice. But I'm not sure. Some might say he's just trying to protect her. But in reality, unless there's a way to mitigate the risk, he can't be in control of her career. So the answer could be A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no). Hmm.\n"
