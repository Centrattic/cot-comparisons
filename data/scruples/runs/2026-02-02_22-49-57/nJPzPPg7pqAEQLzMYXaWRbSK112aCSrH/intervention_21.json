She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about wanting their wife to give up her dangerous job. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the wife has a passion for her work in biomedical research involving venomous animals. She's been in the field for a long time, and the husband has supported her until a recent incident where she was bitten and nearly died. Now he's asking her to stop, which is causing conflict.\n\nOn one hand, the husband's concern is valid. He loves her and fears for her safety. His emotional reaction is understandable, especially after such a traumatic event. He didn't object before but now the situation has escalated. On the other hand, the wife is in her dream job, which has a clear purpose of helping others. She might feel that her husband is undermining her autonomy and her career choice.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and compromise. The husband's fear is legitimate, but does he have the right to dictate her career? The wife has the right to pursue her passion, but maybe she should consider his feelings. However, the husband's request is based on love and fear of losing her. \n\nBut in a healthy relationship, both partners should have autonomy over their own careers unless there's a mutual agreement. The husband is making a personal request based on safety, but it's her body and her career. Unless there's a mutual decision, he can't force her. The fact that they've hit a wall suggests communication issues. The husband might be in the wrong because he's imposing his will on her, even if his motives are good. The wife's stance that it's her dream job and she's aware of the risks could mean the husband shouldn't have the authority to ask her to quit.\n\nBut then again, maybe the husband is justified in his concern. It's a tough call. The answer depends on whether the husband is overstepping by asking her to give up her career for his peace of mind. If she's accepting the risks as part of her job, then his request might be infringing on her autonomy. So the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting her choices, even if he's coming from a place of love.\n"
