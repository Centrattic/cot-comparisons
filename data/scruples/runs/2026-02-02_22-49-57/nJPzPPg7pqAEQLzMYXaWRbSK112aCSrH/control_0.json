She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the wife works with venomous animals, which is inherently risky. She was bitten by a very dangerous snake and almost died. The husband, while supportive of her passion, is now extremely worried for her safety after this incident and is asking her to stop working with such animals. They're having conflicts because she won't give up her career, and he can't see past the risk.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the husband is genuinely concerned for his wife's safety. He's been worried for a while but didn't push before. After a life-threatening incident, his anxiety is justified. He's not trying to control her life but wants to protect her. On the other hand, the wife has a passion she's worked hard for and sees her work as valuable, similar to high-risk professions like police or firefighters. She accepts the risks and believes the benefits outweigh them.\n\nThe question is whether it's fair for the husband to ask her to give it up. The wife's job is her dream, and she's made an informed choice about the risks involved. The husband's role is to support her, but he's now opposing her work. It's a conflict between personal autonomy and a spouse's concern. \n\nThe husband might be overstepping if he's not respecting her autonomy. Even though her job is risky, she has the right to make that decision. The fact that they've had multiple fights and he's not budging could make the situation more complex. However, his fear is real and justified after the near-death experience. It's possible he's not the jerk, but his approach might be causing more harm by not respecting her agency.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? If he's pressuring her to quit a job she chose, then yes, he could be. Spouses can support each other even in high-risk jobs. Firefighters and police officers also take risks. The husband's valid concern doesn't automatically make him the bad guy, but how he's handling it might. If he's not respecting her choice and the work she's passionate about, then he's in the wrong. The key factors are mutual respect, communication, and whether her safety is compromised beyond reasonable risk.\n\nThe husband's argument is that he can't accept the risk. However, the wife is in a profession that she's chosen with awareness of the dangers. Unless the risks are unacceptably high or she's not taking proper precautions, it's her decision. The husband's reaction might be an emotional response, but as long as he's supporting her while expressing his concerns, he's not wrong. But if he's demanding she quit without considering her perspective, that's less supportive.\n\nSo, the husband is not in the wrong (B) because he's acting out of love and concern, but he might need to find a better way to support her. The wife is also not wrong in pursuing her passion. It's a difficult situation where both have valid points, but the husband's intentions are protective, not controlling. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
