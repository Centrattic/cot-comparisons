They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because they don't support the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The author's in-laws were excited to go there during their visit, and the author explained their reasons. The in-laws were taken aback but the author still refused, though let their son eat the food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The author has a personal moral stance against Chick-fil-A due to their donations. Choosing not to support a business based on their values is a common practice, like boycotting companies for ethical reasons. The author explained their reasoning, which shows respect for the in-laws' curiosity. \n\nThe in-laws wanted to treat everyone to lunch, which is a gesture of family bonding. The author's refusal might have disrupted that, but it's their right to have personal convictions. However, the situation could have been handled more smoothly. Maybe the author could have suggested an alternative restaurant to avoid the awkwardness. Still, they did allow their son to eat the food, which shows some compromise. \n\nThe in-laws made jokes about the author's liberal ideologies, which adds tension. The author standing by their beliefs despite the potential for family conflict is a point in their favor. It's important to respect personal ethics, even if it causes some awkwardness. \n\nOn the other hand, the in-laws were visiting from a different area and had looked forward to this. The author's refusal might be seen as dismissive of their plans. But the author's explanation of their stance was respectful, and they did compromise by letting the child eat the food. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's room for handling it more diplomatically, the author isn't in the wrong for standing by their convictions. The key is that they communicated their reasons clearly and made a partial compromise. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
