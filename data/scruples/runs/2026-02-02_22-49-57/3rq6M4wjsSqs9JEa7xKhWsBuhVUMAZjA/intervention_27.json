They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The mother-in-law was excited to get lunch there and wanted to treat everyone. The author explained their reasons, but the in-laws still thought it was odd and made jokes about their liberal views. The author let their son eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's refusal is based on their personal values, specifically opposing the company's support of anti-LGBTQ organizations. That's a valid personal choice. The mother-in-law wanted to treat everyone, which is a common social gesture, but the author felt it was important to stand by their principles.\n\nOn the other hand, the in-laws found the refusal odd and made jokes, which might indicate a clash in values or a lack of understanding. The author's explanation about LGBTQ issues might have been necessary given the mother-in-law's background, which could be in a conservative small town. The author's decision to let the son eat the food while refusing for themselves might be a compromise to avoid conflict.\n\nI should also think about social dynamics. The author's choice could be seen as standing up for their beliefs, which is commendable. However, it did create some tension during the visit, which the user is questioning. The question is whether the author's actions made them an asshole. \n\nIn many cases, people have the right to make personal choices based on their ethics, even if others don't agree. The author didn't force anyone else to refuse the food and allowed their son to eat it, which shows they considered their family's comfort. The mother-in-law's reaction might stem from not understanding the author's perspective, but that doesn't make the author wrong for having their own stance.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a choice based on their values and found a middle ground by letting their son eat the food. The answer should be B.\n"
