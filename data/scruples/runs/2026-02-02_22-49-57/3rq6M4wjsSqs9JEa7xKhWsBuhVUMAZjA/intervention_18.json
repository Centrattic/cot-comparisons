They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A due to the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws wanted to treat everyone to lunch, and the author explained their reasons. The MIL was taken aback, and later there were some jokes from the wife about the author's liberalism. The author let their son eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions are justified. The author's stance is based on personal convictions against supporting certain organizations. It's their right to choose where they spend their money, especially if it aligns with their values. The MIL was excited about the lunch, but the author had a valid reason to decline. \n\nHowever, the situation might have been handled more sensitively. Explaining the reasons in detail could have been done more tactfully, considering the in-laws' possible lack of awareness. The MIL's reaction and the subsequent jokes from the wife suggest that the conversation might have caused some discomfort. The author did allow their son to eat the food, which shows some compromise. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author isn't wrong for standing by their beliefs. People have the right to make personal choices based on their ethics. The key here is that the author didn't force anyone else to share their opinion and allowed their son to partake. The in-laws might not have agreed, but that doesn't make the author in the wrong. The main issue is whether refusing to eat there caused unnecessary conflict. Since the author explained their reasons respectfully and partially compromised, it's more about differing values rather than being an asshole.\n"
