They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat Chick-fil-A because of the company's support of anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws wanted to treat everyone to lunch, and the author explained their stance. The MIL was taken aback, asked questions, and then the author allowed their son to eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's decision is based on their personal convictions against supporting certain organizations. The in-laws are from a small town and are semi-religious, moderate conservatives. The author felt it was important to stand by their beliefs even if it caused some awkwardness.\n\nI should think about whether personal beliefs justify the refusal. The author is not forcing others to share their views; they allowed their son to eat the food. The MIL was trying to have a nice family lunch, and the author's refusal might have made her feel disrespected. However, the author's stance is about their own values, which many people might support, especially regarding LGBTQ rights.\n\nAlso, the wife made jokes about the author's liberal ideologies, which might indicate some tension in the family dynamics. The author's willingness to compromise by letting their son eat the food shows a middle ground. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the question is whether the author's actions were unnecessarily harsh or disrespectful. The author explained their reasons respectfully, didn't impose their views on others, and allowed their son to partake. This seems like standing up for one's principles without being inconsiderate. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
