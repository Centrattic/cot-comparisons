They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A due to the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups, leading to some tension with their in-laws. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points of the situation. The author's mother-in-law was excited to visit and wanted to take the family to lunch at Chick-fil-A. The author refuses because of the company's support for anti-LGBTQ organizations, which the mother-in-law didn't know about. The author explains this, but the mother-in-law still asks them to ignore their convictions for family time. The author then allows their son to eat the food but refuses themselves.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The key aspects here are personal convictions versus family expectations. The author has a valid reason for their stance, which is based on ethical concerns about the company's donations. They explained their reasoning, which shows they tried to be respectful. However, the situation caused some awkwardness and possibly hurt feelings for the mother-in-law, who had been looking forward to this meal.\n\nOn one hand, standing by one's beliefs is important, especially regarding social issues. The author isn't forcing anyone else to comply; they even let their son eat the food, showing they aren't being completely rigid. On the other, family dynamics can be sensitive. The mother-in-law's perspective might involve feeling that the author is imposing their views, especially if the in-laws are more conservative and less familiar with LGBTQ issues. The humor the wife made about the author's liberalism might indicate some tension too.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. In these kinds of scenarios, there's often no clear right or wrong. However, the author's actions were based on personal ethics and they communicated their reasons. They also showed flexibility by allowing their son to eat the food. The mother-in-law's reaction might be more about misunderstanding or differing values rather than the author being in the wrong. \n\nIt's possible the author could have found a compromise earlier, like suggesting an alternative restaurant, but given the context, they tried to explain and were respectful. The core issue is a clash of values, not necessarily wrongdoing. So, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
