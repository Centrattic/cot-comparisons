They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A due to the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups, which their in-laws found awkward and possibly inconvenient.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's in-laws are conservative and religious, and they were excited to eat at Chick-fil-A. The author refuses because of their stance against the company's support of certain organizations. The key points here are the author's personal beliefs versus the family's expectations. \n\nThe author explains their reasoning to their in-laws, which shows they tried to communicate their values. The in-laws then wanted to proceed with the meal regardless, which created tension. The author then allows their son to eat the food but refuses themselves. \n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether their refusal is unjustified. Personal beliefs and ethical choices are generally protected, so refusing to support a business based on its values isn't inherently wrong. However, the social impact on the family dynamic is a factor. The author's wife made jokes about their liberal ideologies, indicating possible strain.\n\nBut the author isn't forcing others to share their views; they allowed their son to eat the food. They also communicated their reasons respectfully. The main conflict arises from differing values, not from the author acting inconsiderately without explanation. \n\nIn such cases, the right to hold personal convictions is important. The author isn't causing harm beyond the social discomfort, which is a common part of differing opinions. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
