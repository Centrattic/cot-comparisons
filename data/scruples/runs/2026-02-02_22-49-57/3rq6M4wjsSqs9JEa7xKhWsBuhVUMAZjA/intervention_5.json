They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The situation involves the author's in-laws, who are conservative and wanted to treat everyone to lunch. The author explained their stance, which led to some tension, and then partially complied by letting their son eat the food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author has personal convictions about supporting businesses based on their values. Chick-fil-A's support of certain organizations could be a legitimate concern for someone who opposes those groups. The author isn't imposing their beliefs on others; they're making a personal choice and allowing their child to eat the food, which shows some compromise.\n\nThe in-laws felt it was odd and made jokes about the author's liberal views. That might indicate a lack of respect or understanding from their side. The author stood by their beliefs while still being respectful and allowing family time. The key points are the author's right to their convictions and the compromise made by letting the son eat the food. It seems like the author is not in the wrong here because they communicated their reasons, respected the family's choice, and found a middle ground.\n"
