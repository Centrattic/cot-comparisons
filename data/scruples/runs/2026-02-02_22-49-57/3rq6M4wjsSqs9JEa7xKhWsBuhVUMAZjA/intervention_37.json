They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's mother-in-law wanted to take everyone to Chick-fil-A, but the author refused to eat there because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The mother-in-law was surprised and asked for explanations, which the author provided. The wife made some jokes about the author's liberal views while the author was out of the room. The author then allowed their son to eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The in-laws are described as semi-religious and moderate conservatives. The mother-in-law was excited about the restaurant because it's close by. The author's refusal is based on personal convictions regarding supporting certain organizations, which is a common reason people choose where not to spend their money. \n\nThe mother-in-law asked questions, and the author explained. That seems like a responsible approach, giving her the information to understand their stance. The author didn't force others to not eat the food, just themselves. They even allowed their son to eat it, which is the child, so maybe they don't want to impose their views on the kid. \n\nBut the key issue here is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing their personal values over the family's plans. Cultural and political differences can affect family dynamics. The mother-in-law might have seen the refusal as a personal slight or not respecting the gesture of treating the family. The author's wife also made jokes about their liberalism, which could indicate some underlying tension. \n\nHowever, the author didn't force anyone else to not eat the food, and they compromised by allowing their son to eat it. The question is about being in the wrong. If the author's actions were respectful and clear communication, then it's not necessarily their fault. On the other hand, if the refusal caused unnecessary conflict or didn't consider the family's feelings, maybe there's a point there.\n\nBut considering that the author explained their reasons and made a compromise, they seem to have handled it respectfully. The mother-in-law might have had a different opinion, but the author isn't obligated to support organizations they disagree with. Allowing the son to eat the food shows they aren't making an issue with the child. \n\nSo I think the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
