They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat Chick-fil-A. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's in-laws are semi-religious, moderate conservatives from a small town. They're visiting, and the mother-in-law was excited to get Chick-fil-A, which is nearby. The author refuses to eat there because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The mother-in-law wanted to treat everyone to lunch, but the author explained their reasons. The in-laws then got the food without the author and made some jokes about their liberal views. The author ended up letting their son eat the food but refused themselves. Now, they're wondering if they're the asshole for causing awkwardness.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical implications. The author has a right to hold personal beliefs and act on them, especially regarding supporting businesses based on their values. LGBTQ rights are a significant social issue, and many people choose not to support companies that fund anti-LGBTQ organizations. So, the author's stance isn't baseless.\n\nOn the other hand, the situation did create tension. The in-laws were anticipating a family meal, and the author's refusal might have been a disappointment. However, the author's explanation about the donations seems reasonable, especially when someone asks. The mother-in-law's reaction and the subsequent jokes from the wife could be more problematic, as they might have come across as dismissive or mocking.\n\nThe author did compromise by allowing their son to eat the food, which shows they tried to minimize conflict. The key here is whether the author overstepped by not participating in a family meal because of their beliefs. But personal convictions often come into play in such decisions. It's about balancing individual ethics with family dynamics.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while it's common to make personal choices based on values, doing so in a family setting can lead to friction. However, the author isn't forcing anyone else to follow their beliefs; they're just declining to participate themselves. The in-laws' mockery after the situation might indicate a lack of respect for differing opinions, which could be their fault.\n\nI think the main issue is whether the author's actions were disrespectful. They explained their reasons calmly and allowed their child to partake. They didn't prevent the in-laws from getting the food, just chose not to join. That seems like a reasonable approach. The in-laws' reaction and the wife's comments are more to blame here. The author isn't in the wrong for standing by their convictions, even if it caused some awkwardness. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
