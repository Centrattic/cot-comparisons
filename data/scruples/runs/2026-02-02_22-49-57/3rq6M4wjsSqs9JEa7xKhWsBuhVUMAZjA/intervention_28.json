They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A due to its donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author's in-laws are conservative and wanted to treat everyone to lunch at Chick-fil-A. The author refuses because of the company's donations, which the mother-in-law wasn't aware of. The author explains their reasons, but the in-laws are taken aback and make minor jokes about the author's liberal views. The author allows their son to eat the food but refuses themselves.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal convictions versus family expectations. The author is standing by their beliefs, which is a personal choice. However, the situation caused some awkwardness with the in-laws. \n\nI need to decide if the author's actions make them the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nOn one hand, the author is being consistent with their values and isn't forcing others to follow their stance\u2014they even let their son eat the food. On the other hand, the refusal might have upset the in-laws who were excited about this lunch. But the author didn't force the in-laws to get the food; they just chose not to participate themselves. \n\nThe mother-in-law wanted to treat everyone, so maybe the author could have found a compromise, but the author's explanation about the donations is valid. The in-laws made jokes about the author's views, which could indicate some tension. However, the author's main issue is with the company's donations, which is a personal ethical choice. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they're sticking to their principles without imposing on others. The in-laws might feel disrespected, but the author didn't prevent others from eating there. It's a matter of personal ethics versus family dynamics, and the author isn't forcing anyone to not support Chick-fil-A. So the answer is B.\n"
