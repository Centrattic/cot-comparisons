They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat Chick-fil-A during a family lunch with in-laws. The author's in-laws wanted to treat everyone to Chick-fil-A, which the author's mother-in-law was excited about. The author declined because they don't support the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws were taken aback, the author had to explain their stance, and there was some tension. The author allowed their son to eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core of the issue. The author has a personal conviction against supporting certain organizations, which is a matter of individual ethics. The in-laws, on the other hand, might view the refusal as being disrespectful or causing awkwardness. \n\nThe key points here are personal beliefs versus family dynamics. The author is standing by their values, which is their right. However, the situation involves family, so the author's decision might affect family relations. The question is whether the author's choice to prioritize their values over the in-laws' wishes is justified.\n\nIn such cases, it's common for people to have differing opinions on what's more important: personal ethics or family harmony. The author didn't force their son to eat, but allowed him to do so, which shows some compromise. The wife's reaction with minor jokes suggests that the family might be more conservative or less supportive of the author's stance, adding to the tension.\n\nThe author's explanation about the donations and the need to explain LGBTQ terms indicates a possible generational or ideological gap. The mother-in-law might not be aware of or in agreement with the author's perspective. However, the author's right to hold personal beliefs shouldn't be seen as wrong just because others disagree. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I agree. The author is making a conscious choice based on their values, which is a personal decision. While the situation is awkward, the author isn't at fault for having those beliefs. The in-laws might feel hurt, but the author's actions are a reflection of their own ethics. The compromise of allowing the son to eat the food shows the author tried to find a middle ground, which is reasonable.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
