They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws are conservative and religious, and the mother-in-law was excited to get lunch there. The author explained their stance, but it led to some awkwardness. The wife made jokes about the author's liberalism, and the author let their son eat the food but not themselves.\n\nFirst, the author's refusal is based on personal convictions regarding supporting organizations linked to anti-LGBTQ causes. This is a matter of personal ethics and values. The in-laws might not agree, but the author isn't forcing them to do anything. The key point here is whether the author overstepped by refusing to join them, considering the family context.\n\nThe author did explain their reasons, which shows they tried to be respectful. However, the situation became awkward, and the in-laws felt it was odd. The wife's reaction adds another layer, but the author isn't responsible for her jokes. The author allowed their son to eat the food, which shows some compromise, but still held their own stance.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's about whether the author acted unreasonably or without empathy. The author's actions were based on their values, and they tried to communicate that. While it caused tension, it's not clear that the author was wrong for standing by their beliefs. The decision to let the son eat the food while refusing themselves might be seen as a middle ground, balancing their values with family dynamics. So, I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
