They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of its donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws are visiting from a small town, and the mother-in-law was excited to eat there. The author explained their stance, but it led to some awkwardness, including the in-laws making jokes about the author's \"liberal ideologies.\" The author then allowed their son to eat the food but not themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the author's actions. They have a valid reason for not wanting to support the company based on its donations. It's their right to make that choice. However, the situation involves family dynamics. The mother-in-law wanted to treat everyone, and the author's refusal caused some tension. But was the author wrong?\n\nThe key points here are personal ethics versus family harmony. The author stands by their convictions, which is understandable. They also allowed their son to eat the food, which might mitigate some of the conflict. The in-laws made jokes, which could be seen as dismissive or mocking, which adds context to the author's stance being justified.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it more diplomatically. Perhaps finding an alternative restaurant or compromising would have been better. But the author didn't force anyone else to refuse; they only declined themselves. Their son ate the food, so the refusal wasn't enforced on others.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole. In AITA scenarios, the line is often drawn between respecting personal beliefs and causing unnecessary conflict. Here, the author's refusal is based on a principled stand, and they didn't impose it on others. The in-laws' reaction (jokes about liberal ideologies) suggests they might be the ones being less understanding. The author's explanation about the donations shows they tried to be open and respectful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a choice aligned with their values, allowed others to eat the food, and the in-laws' reaction seems to be the bigger issue. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
