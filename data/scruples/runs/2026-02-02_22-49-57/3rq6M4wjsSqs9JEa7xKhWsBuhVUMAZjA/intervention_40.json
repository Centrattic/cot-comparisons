They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author's in-laws are visiting, and the mother-in-law was really excited to eat at Chick-fil-A, which is close to their house. The author doesn't want to eat there because of the donations Chick-fil-A makes to anti-LGBTQ groups. They explained this to the in-laws, but the mother-in-law asked them to ignore their personal beliefs for family lunch. The author refused to eat but let their son have the food. The wife made some jokes about the author's liberal views. Now, the author is questioning if they're the asshole for making the lunch awkward or for letting their son eat the food they consider problematic.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The author's reasons for not eating at Chick-fil-A are based on the company's support for anti-LGBTQ groups. That's a matter of personal ethics and values. The in-laws might not agree with those reasons, seeing it as unnecessary or too political for a family outing. The author explained their stance, which shows they weren't just being dismissive. However, the situation caused some tension, especially with the mother-in-law's excitement and the wife's comments.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, respecting personal convictions is important. Choosing not to support businesses that align with harmful ideologies is a common stance for many people. The author explained their reasons, so it's not like they were being secretive or rude. Letting the son eat the food might be a compromise to avoid conflict, but the author still stands by their own decision not to partake. \n\nOn the other hand, the in-laws might feel that the author is prioritizing their beliefs over family harmony. The mother-in-law had looked forward to this meal, and the author's refusal might have been seen as dismissive of her excitement. However, the author did make an effort to compromise by allowing the son to eat the food, which shows consideration for the child's desires and possibly to ease the situation.\n\nAnother angle is the context of the explanation about LGBTQ issues. The author had to explain what LGBTQ means, which might indicate that the in-laws aren't familiar with the terminology or the issues. The mother-in-law's persistence in asking the author to ignore their beliefs suggests a lack of understanding or empathy towards the author's stance. The wife's jokes could be adding to the tension, but that's a separate issue.\n\nIn terms of social norms, family gatherings can sometimes require compromises, especially with extended family. However, personal ethics and values are also significant. The author isn't forcing anyone else to avoid the restaurant; they're just making a choice for themselves. Letting the son eat the food while they themselves refuse could be seen as respecting the child's preference without compromising their own principles.\n\nConsidering all these points, I think the author is not in the wrong. They expressed their reasons for not eating at Chick-fil-A, made a compromise for their son, and stood by their convictions. The in-laws might not agree, but that doesn't make the author an asshole. It's about balancing personal ethics with family dynamics, and the author seems to have done their best to navigate the situation respectfully.\n"
