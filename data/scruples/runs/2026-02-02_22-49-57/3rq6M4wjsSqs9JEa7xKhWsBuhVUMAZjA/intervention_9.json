They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because they don't support the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws wanted to treat the family to lunch there, and the author's refusal caused some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's stance is based on personal convictions against certain organizations. They explained their reasons to their mother-in-law, which shows they tried to be respectful. The in-laws found it odd and made jokes about the author's liberalism, which indicates cultural or ideological differences. The author allowed their son to eat the food but refused for themselves, which might be seen as a compromise.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From one perspective, refusing to join a family meal chosen by relatives could be seen as causing discomfort or being difficult. However, the author stood by their beliefs and communicated their reasons. They even let their child eat the food, showing some flexibility. The in-laws' reaction included making jokes, which might suggest they weren't fully open to the author's perspective.\n\nIt's important to balance personal ethics with family dynamics. The author's actions were based on their values, and they didn't force others to comply. The in-laws initiated the meal choice, and the author's refusal was a personal choice, not imposing on others. The wife's comments also add context\u2014maybe the in-laws weren't fully respectful of the author's stance.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to prioritize their convictions while allowing their son to partake seems reasonable. The in-laws' responses may have exacerbated the situation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
