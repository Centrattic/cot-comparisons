They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The situation involves the author's in-laws, who are conservative and religious. The mother-in-law wanted to treat everyone to lunch at Chick-fil-A, but the author refused, explaining their stance. The in-laws then made jokes about the author's liberal views, and the author allowed their son to eat the food but not themselves. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The author is making a personal choice based on their values regarding supporting businesses that align with their beliefs. The key point here is whether refusing to eat at a restaurant based on the company's donations is a reasonable personal choice.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA). To determine this, I should consider if the author overstepped by making a personal choice that affected family dynamics. The author explained their reasons, which shows they weren't being dismissive. However, the in-laws were hurt and felt the decision was odd. The author did allow their son to eat the food, which could be seen as a compromise. \n\nBut wait, the author's stance is based on supporting LGBTQ rights. In many modern contexts, this is a valid and widely accepted position. The in-laws might not share these views, but the author isn't obligated to suppress their values for family. However, the situation could have been handled differently to avoid awkwardness. The author could have compromised by choosing another restaurant or eating there without participating in the specific donations. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did explain their reasoning, which is respectful. The in-laws made jokes about the author's views, which might indicate that they weren't as open-minded as the author hoped. The author's refusal isn't forcing others to follow their beliefs; they allowed their son to eat the food. So, the author isn't in the wrong for upholding their convictions, even if it caused some tension. \n\nThe answer would likely be B (No), as personal values and the right to make choices based on those values are generally respected, especially when explained and not imposed on others.\n"
