They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws were excited to go there and wanted to treat everyone to lunch. The author explained their stance, which included explaining what LGBTQ stands for to their mother-in-law. The wife made jokes about the author's liberal views when the in-laws left. The author let their son eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects here. The author is making a personal choice based on their beliefs. They aren't forcing anyone else to do anything, just declining to participate in something they disagree with. The in-laws might be disappointed, but respecting individual values is important. However, the author did cause some awkwardness, which could be seen as being inflexible in a social setting. \n\nBut then, the author partially compromised by allowing their son to eat the food. That shows they aren't entirely rigid. The key issue is whether the author overstepped by stating their beliefs in a way that made the visit uncomfortable. The mother-in-law was taken aback, but the author was respectful and explained their reasoning. The wife's reaction might be more of a problem, but the question is about the author's actions. \n\nIn many discussions like this, personal convictions about supporting certain businesses are often protected under freedom of speech. The author isn't harming anyone by not eating there. The awkwardness comes from the in-laws' expectations versus the author's values. Since the author didn't eat the food, but let the son have it, they are balancing their beliefs with family considerations. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're standing by their values and didn't make a public spectacle or force others to comply. The compromise with the son also shows they aren't entirely inflexible. So the answer is B.\n"
