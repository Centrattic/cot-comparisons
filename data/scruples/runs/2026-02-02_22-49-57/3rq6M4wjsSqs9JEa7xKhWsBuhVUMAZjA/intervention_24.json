They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A based on the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The situation involves the in-laws visiting, the mother-in-law being excited to take everyone to Chick-fil-A, and the author declining, leading to some tension and jokes from the wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's refusal is based on personal principles regarding supporting companies that align with their values. Chick-fil-A has been known for their support of conservative causes, including some that are anti-LGBTQ, which the author clearly explained. The in-laws were taken aback, and the author tried to explain their stance, even down to defining what LGBTQ means, which might indicate the in-laws had limited prior knowledge on the topic.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to hold personal convictions and the social dynamics involved. Refusing to support a company based on their values is a personal choice, and many people make similar decisions. However, it's in a family setting, which can complicate things because of potential conflicts with relatives. The author did allow their son to eat the food, which might be seen as a compromise, but they still refused themselves. The in-laws felt it was awkward, and the wife made jokes about their \"liberal ideologies,\" which adds to the tension.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is standing by their beliefs, which is valid. On the other hand, it caused discomfort during a family gathering. The question is whether the author's actions were unreasonable. Since the author explained their reasoning and tried to be respectful, it seems like they made a conscientious decision. The in-laws were the ones who initiated the outing, but the author's refusal is a personal choice. The fact that the author compromised by letting their son eat the food shows they tried to be considerate. The jokes from the wife suggest that the in-laws might not have fully understood or respected the author's stance, but that doesn't make the author wrong for holding their beliefs.\n\nIn similar situations, people often have the right to make choices based on their values, even if it causes some friction. The author didn't force anyone else to comply and allowed their child to eat the food, which is a middle ground. The main issue is the in-laws' reaction and the wife's comments, but that doesn't reflect on the author's rightness. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
