They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups, which causes some tension with their in-laws. The in-laws wanted to treat the family to lunch, and the author ended up letting their son eat the food but not themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author has a personal belief against supporting certain organizations. They explained their reasoning, even had to define what LGBTQ means, which might suggest that the in-laws weren't as informed about these issues. The in-laws then made minor jokes about the author's liberal views when they thought he wasn't listening. The author felt awkward but allowed their son to eat the food. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is the asshole for making the lunch awkward by refusing, or if they're justified in their convictions. On one hand, the author is standing up for their beliefs, which is a personal right. On the other hand, it's a family gathering, and causing discomfort might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author did compromise by letting their son eat the food, which shows some flexibility.\n\nThe in-laws' reaction is also a factor. They wanted to treat everyone, but the author's refusal led to awkwardness. But the author wasn't forced to eat it; they chose to refuse. Also, the in-laws made jokes about the author's views, which could be part of the tension. The author's explanation about the donations is valid, as many people do choose not to support companies based on their values.\n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't being inconsiderate; they're making a personal choice based on their values. They did explain their reasoning, which is respectful. The in-laws might not agree, but that doesn't make the author wrong for having those beliefs. The author also partially compromised by allowing their son to eat the food, which mitigates some of the tension. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
