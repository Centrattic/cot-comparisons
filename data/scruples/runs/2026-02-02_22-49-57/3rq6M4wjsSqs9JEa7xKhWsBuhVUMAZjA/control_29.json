They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author refused to eat at Chick-fil-A because they support anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws wanted to treat everyone to lunch there, and the author explained their reasoning. The mother-in-law was surprised, the wife made some jokes about the author's liberal views, and the author let the son eat the food but not themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the different perspectives. The author is standing by their beliefs, which is about supporting LGBTQ rights. That's a valid personal conviction. On the other hand, the in-laws might see this as being difficult or causing awkwardness during a family visit. The author's refusal didn't prevent others from eating, which is a good point\u2014they let their son have the meal. But they might feel like they caused discomfort to their in-laws who were looking forward to it.\n\nIs the author wrong for prioritizing their values over family comfort? Well, people have the right to their beliefs, and it's not inherently wrong to choose not to support businesses that align with anti-LGBTQ causes. However, the way the situation was handled could affect family dynamics. The author tried to explain their stance respectfully, which is positive. The in-laws might not fully understand or agree, but that doesn't make the author the asshole for holding their ground.\n\nThe wife's reaction adds another layer. Making jokes about the author's views could create tension. But the author's main issue here is their own decision. Letting the son eat the food while refusing themselves shows some compromise, so they're not entirely rigid. \n\nIn terms of being the asshole, it's about whether the author's actions were unreasonable or unnecessarily hurtful. Since they explained their reasons, respected the in-laws' choice to go, and allowed their son to eat the meal, it seems like they tried to balance their values with family considerations. The in-laws might be offended, but the author isn't wrong for having those values. The answer is B.\n"
