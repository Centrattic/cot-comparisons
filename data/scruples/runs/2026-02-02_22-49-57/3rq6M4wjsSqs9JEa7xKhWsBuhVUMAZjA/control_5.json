They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws are visiting, and the mother-in-law was excited to get lunch there. The author explained their stance, but the in-laws found it odd and made jokes. The author let their son eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's refusal is based on their personal convictions about supporting or not supporting certain organizations. The in-laws, being from a different background, might not understand or agree with that stance. The question is whether this refusal makes the author the asshole.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's important to note that personal beliefs about corporate practices can be valid. People have the right to make choices based on their values. However, family dynamics and social situations can complicate things. The author did explain their reasoning, which shows they tried to communicate their stance respectfully. The in-laws made jokes about their \"liberal ideologies,\" which might indicate a lack of understanding or respect from their side.\n\nThe author also allowed their son to eat the food, which might have been a way to compromise. But the main issue is whether the author was wrong in refusing to eat there. Since the author stood by their convictions without being confrontational, it's more about personal ethics vs. social expectations. The in-laws were the ones who made jokes and felt it was odd, which suggests they were less respectful. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
