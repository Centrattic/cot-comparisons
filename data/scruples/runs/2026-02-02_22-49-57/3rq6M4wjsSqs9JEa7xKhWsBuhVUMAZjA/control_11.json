They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups, which causes some tension with his in-laws.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's in-laws are visiting, and the mother-in-law was excited about getting Chick-fil-A. The author declines the meal due to his values, explains his reasoning, but then allows his son to eat the food. The in-laws find this odd and make minor jokes about his liberalism. The author is conflicted about whether he's being an ass by prioritizing his convictions over family harmony.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, people have the right to hold their beliefs and make choices based on them. Supporting or boycotting companies based on their actions is a personal decision. The author is standing by his values, which is his right. Additionally, allowing his son to eat the food shows some compromise, so he's not entirely rigid.\n\nOn the other hand, the situation might have been handled more smoothly. The author could have considered the in-laws' feelings more, perhaps finding an alternative way to accommodate both his values and their excitement. However, the in-laws also reacted with minor jokes, which might indicate they took it lightly, but the author's refusal is a personal choice.\n\nIn many cases, it's about balancing personal ethics with social harmony. Since the author is not forcing his beliefs on others and is allowing his son to partake, he's making a personal choice without imposing it on others. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
