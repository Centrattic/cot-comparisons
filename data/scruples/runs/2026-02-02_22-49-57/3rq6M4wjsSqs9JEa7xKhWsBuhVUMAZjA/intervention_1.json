They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A due to the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups, causing some tension with their in-laws. The options are A for yes, B for no. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's in-laws are visiting from a small town, and the mother-in-law was excited about getting Chick-fil-A. The author refused because of the company's support for anti-LGBTQ organizations, which led to a discussion about LGBTQ issues. The in-laws ended up getting the food, the author let their son eat it but refused themselves. The wife made some jokes about the author's liberal views.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is standing by their values and beliefs, which is a personal choice. On the other hand, it might have upset the in-laws and caused awkwardness. \n\nI should think about whether personal convictions are a valid reason to make such a choice. The author didn't force anyone else to refuse the food; they even allowed their son to eat it, which shows some compromise. The in-laws were respectful in their questioning, and the author explained their stance. \n\nIs it reasonable for the author to prioritize their values over family harmony in this situation? People have different stances on social issues, and it's not uncommon for family differences to arise. The author's actions seem to be a personal choice rather than a forced imposition. \n\nThe in-laws might not agree, but the author isn't in the wrong for holding their beliefs. The question is about whether the author is the asshole, not about whether the in-laws are. Since the author acted respectfully and allowed their son to eat the food, it seems like a reasonable approach. \n\nSo the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
