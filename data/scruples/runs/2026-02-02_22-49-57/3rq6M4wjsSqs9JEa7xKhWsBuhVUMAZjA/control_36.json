They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of its donations to anti-LGBTQ groups, which upsets their in-laws. The in-laws are moderate conservatives and semi-religious, and the mother-in-law was excited to treat everyone to lunch there. The author explained their stance, had to define LGBTQ for the MiL, and faced pressure to ignore their convictions. The wife made jokes about the author's liberal ideologies when the in-laws left. The author then let their son eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments for and against the author. On one hand, the author is standing by their personal values and beliefs. They have the right to make choices based on their ethical stance, especially if it's about supporting certain causes or opposing others. Refusing to eat at a place because of its donations is a matter of moral choice, and it's common for people to have such preferences. The author also didn't make the in-laws leave or not share the meal; they allowed their son to eat it, showing some flexibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the in-laws might feel that the author is being overly sensitive or causing unnecessary conflict, especially if they are not familiar with the controversies. The mother-in-law was looking forward to the lunch and the author's refusal could be seen as taking the fun out of the family gathering. The wife's jokes suggest that there might be some personal or political tensions in the relationship, which could be a factor in how the situation is perceived.\n\nNow, the key points here are whether the author's refusal is a personal moral choice that's reasonable and if they crossed a line by making the meal awkward. The author did explain their reasoning, which is respectful. Allowing the son to eat shows compromise. The in-laws were informed and still chose to proceed, so the author isn't forcing them to act a certain way. The real question is if the author's consistency in their beliefs made the family event uncomfortable. In such cases, the balance between personal ethics and family dynamics is tricky, but the author's actions seem justified. The in-laws can choose to support the restaurant, and the author can choose not to, as long as it's done respectfully without coercion. The wife's reaction might indicate underlying issues, but that's separate from the author's right to hold their convictions.\n"
