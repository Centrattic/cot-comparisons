They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of their donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The situation involves in-laws who are moderate conservatives and the author's wife and son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author refused to eat there due to moral reasons related to the company's donations. The mother-in-law was looking forward to it and wanted to treat everyone. The author explained their stance, which led to some tension. The wife and in-laws made jokes about the author's liberal views. The author allowed the son to eat the food but not themselves.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The question is about personal ethics versus family dynamics. The author's decision is based on their values, which is a personal right. However, the situation caused awkwardness during a family visit. The answer hinges on whether personal convictions justify the resulting discomfort in a family setting.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person's actions were reasonable and if they overstepped. Here, the author didn't force others; they made a personal choice. The in-laws were the ones who wanted to treat everyone, so the author's refusal might be seen as a personal choice rather than being an asshole. Allowing the son to eat the food shows some compromise, which could mitigate guilt.\n\nHowever, there's a balance. Making the family visit awkward might be seen as a downside, but the author's right to hold their convictions is also important. The jokes from the wife and in-laws suggest they didn't take the issue seriously, which might be on them. The author isn't forcing others to conform, just opting out. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
