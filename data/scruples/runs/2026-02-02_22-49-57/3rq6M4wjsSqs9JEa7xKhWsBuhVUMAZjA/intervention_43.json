They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author's in-laws are semi-religious conservatives visiting from a small town. The mother-in-law was really excited to eat at Chick-fil-A nearby. The author refuses to eat there because they don't support the organizations Chick-fil-A donates to, specifically anti-LGBTQ groups. The author explains their reasoning, but the in-laws still want to go. The author's wife's family thinks it's odd and teases the author. The author lets their son eat the food but refuses themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's stance. They have a personal conviction against supporting certain groups through their donations. It's their right to hold that belief and act on it. The in-laws wanted to treat the family, which the author didn't support. The author communicates their reasons clearly, even explaining LGBTQ issues, which shows they were trying to be respectful.\n\nThe in-laws might not agree with the author's views, but the author isn't forcing anyone else. They let their son eat the food, showing compromise. The author's refusal is personal and not imposing on others. The main conflict here is between personal ethics and family expectations. The in-laws might feel slighted, but the author isn't wrong for standing by their convictions. It's a situation where different values clash, but the author isn't the asshole for choosing their stance.\n"
