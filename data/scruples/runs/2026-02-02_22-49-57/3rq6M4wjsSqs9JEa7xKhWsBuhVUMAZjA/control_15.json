They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the donations they make to certain organizations, specifically anti-LGBTQ groups. The author's mother-in-law was excited to eat there and wanted to treat the family to lunch. The author explained their reasons, but the in-laws still didn't agree and made jokes about their liberal views. The author ended up allowing their son to eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is standing by their beliefs, which is a personal choice. However, the context is a family gathering, which can be a sensitive situation. The in-laws were visiting from a small town and had been looking forward to this. The author's refusal might have caused some awkwardness, but is that the author's fault?\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to make personal choices based on their values. It's important to stay true to one's convictions, especially regarding supporting businesses that align (or not) with their values. The author also didn't force their views on others; they allowed their child to eat the food. The mother-in-law was informed and respected the author's stance, even if they disagreed. \n\nOn the other hand, family dynamics can be tricky. The author's refusal might have been seen as dismissive or causing unnecessary tension. The mother-in-law's excitement was somewhat ignored, leading to awkwardness. However, the author didn't insist on changing the plans entirely and compromised by letting their son eat the food. \n\nThe key points here are the author's right to their beliefs, the compromise made, and the respectful communication. The author didn't force their views on the entire family but stood by their own. The in-laws' jokes about the author's liberal ideologies might indicate that the issue wasn't their stance but the author's refusal. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they acted based on their values and tried to communicate respectfully. The compromise of allowing the son to eat the food shows they weren't entirely inflexible. The in-laws, while possibly disappointed, were treated with respect. The author's actions don't seem to be malicious or overly intrusive. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
