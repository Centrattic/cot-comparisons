They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author's in-laws are visiting, and the mother-in-law (MiL) is excited to go to Chick-fil-A because it's nearby. The author refuses to eat there because they don't support the anti-LGBTQ groups Chick-fil-A donates to. The MiL asks for explanations, and the author explains the donations and the LGBTQ meaning. The in-laws then press the author to ignore their convictions and eat with the family. The author lets their son eat the food but refuses themselves. The wife seems to think it's odd and makes jokes about the author's liberal views.\n\nFirst, the author's stance is based on personal values regarding supporting anti-LGBTQ organizations. That's a valid reason for some people. The issue is whether refusing to eat there is inconsiderate or causes unnecessary conflict. The author tried to explain their reasoning, which shows they're not being unreasonable. The in-laws didn't seem to understand or accept the explanation, leading to awkwardness.\n\nThe author did let their son eat the food, so they compromised to some extent. However, the main question is about whether the author is in the wrong for their refusal. The key points are respect for each other's beliefs and the impact on family dynamics. The author might be seen as standing by their principles, which is good, but it's also important to consider the family's feelings. However, the in-laws initiated the meal plan, and the author had the right to decline based on their values. The wife's reactions might indicate some tension, but the author isn't forcing their views on others. They just didn't participate themselves. \n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" it's about whether they acted inconsiderately. The author explained their reasoning respectfully and made a compromise. So, they might not be in the wrong. The answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
