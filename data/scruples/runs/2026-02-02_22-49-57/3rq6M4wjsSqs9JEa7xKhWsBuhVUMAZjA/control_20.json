They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because they support anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws wanted to treat everyone to lunch there, and the author explained their reasons. The mother-in-law was taken aback, then the in-laws made jokes about the author's liberal views. The author let their son eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They have a personal conviction about not supporting businesses that donate to anti-LGBTQ organizations. That's a valid personal choice. People have the right to make such decisions based on their values. However, the situation is within a family setting, so social dynamics come into play.\n\nThe in-laws are visiting from a small town, and the mother-in-law was excited about the Chick-fil-A nearby. The author's refusal might have made the visit awkward for the family. The in-laws might not share the same views, leading to tension. The author's wife mentioned the in-laws thought it odd and made jokes, which adds to the social discomfort.\n\nBut the author also compromised by letting their son eat the food. This shows some flexibility. The key is whether the author overstepped by not eating with the family, causing awkwardness. Personal convictions are important, but in a family context, balancing personal beliefs with social harmony is tricky.\n\nIs it the author's fault for holding their beliefs? Probably not. They have the right to their opinions. However, the way they handled it might have been insensitive. Explaining the reasons was good, but the refusal in front of the family might have been a social misstep. The author could have suggested an alternative, like a different restaurant, to maintain family harmony without compromising their values.\n\nThe question is whether the author is an asshole for prioritizing their beliefs over family comfort. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the importance of family dynamics versus personal ethics. Since the author made a compromise (letting the son eat) and tried to explain their stance, maybe they aren't entirely wrong. But the situation is nuanced. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because standing by one's values is valid, even if it causes some discomfort. However, if the refusal was unnecessarily causing family tension without a good alternative, it could be seen as A. But given the explanation and compromise, B seems more likely.\n"
