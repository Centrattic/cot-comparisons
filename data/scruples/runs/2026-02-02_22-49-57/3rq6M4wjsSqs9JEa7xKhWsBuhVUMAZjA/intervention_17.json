They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the restaurant's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The author's mother-in-law was excited to treat everyone there, and the author explained their stance. The mother-in-law then asked the author to ignore their beliefs for family time, but the author refused. The wife and son ended up eating, but the author didn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's decision is based on personal ethics regarding supporting businesses that donate to anti-LGBTQ causes. The mother-in-law found it odd and made jokes about the author's liberal views. The author let the son eat but refused themselves. \n\nThe main issue here is balancing personal convictions against family dynamics. The author isn't forcing anyone else to refuse the food, just themselves. They explained their reasons respectfully, even though the mother-in-law was taken aback. The author's refusal isn't about being rude but about aligning with their values. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it more tactfully. For example, suggesting an alternative restaurant or being more understanding of the mother-in-law's excitement. But the author did state their reasons clearly and allowed others to partake, which shows consideration for the family's wishes. \n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" it's about whether the action was unjustified or inconsiderate. The author's actions are based on personal ethics, which is a valid reason. They didn't prevent others from eating, just themselves. So, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). The mother-in-law's reaction and the wife's jokes might reflect generational or cultural differences, but the author's stance is about their values. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n"
