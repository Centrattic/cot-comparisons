They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because they don't support the organizations that Chick-fil-A donates to, specifically mentioning anti-LGBTQ groups. The mother-in-law was excited to eat there and wanted to treat everyone, including the author's family. The author explained their reasons, even had to explain what LGBTQ means, which suggests maybe the in-laws aren't very familiar with the term. The mother-in-law pushed back, asked the author to ignore their beliefs for family time. The author let their son eat the food but refused themselves. Now the author is questioning if they're in the wrong for making the lunch awkward or for compromising by letting their son eat it.\n\nFirst, the author is standing by their personal convictions. They have a right to their beliefs, especially regarding supporting businesses that align with their values. However, the situation involves family dynamics and possibly causing discomfort. The mother-in-law was looking forward to this meal, and the author's refusal might have made things awkward. The author also allowed their son to eat the food, which might be seen as partial compromise.\n\nThe key points here are about personal ethics versus family harmony. The author isn't forcing others to share their views but is choosing not to support the restaurant based on their values. The mother-in-law's reaction might be due to not understanding or respecting the author's stance, which is why the author had to explain LGBTQ issues. The author's wife made jokes about their liberal ideologies, which adds another layer of possible tension.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's about whether the author's actions were unreasonable or overly self-centered. The author's refusal is based on their beliefs, which they're entitled to. However, in a family setting, making a big deal out of it could be seen as causing unnecessary conflict. But the mother-in-law also expected compliance with her plans without considering the author's views. The author's compromise by allowing their son to eat the food shows some flexibility, which might mitigate the situation.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were respectful. They explained their reasons, which shows consideration. They didn't force anyone else to follow their stance. The mother-in-law's pushback might be due to her own values, but the author isn't obligated to ignore their convictions for family time. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
