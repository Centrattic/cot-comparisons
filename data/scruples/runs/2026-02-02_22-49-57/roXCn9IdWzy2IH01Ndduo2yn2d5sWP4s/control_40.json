Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a conflict at an airport between the author and an older lady.\n\nFirst, the lady sits next to the author and plays a show loudly on her iPad. The author puts in earbuds and ignores it. Then the author makes a phone call using the earbuds, which the lady finds rude. She asks him to be quiet. The author responds by telling her that her loud iPad is actually rude, pointing out that she should be using headphones. The lady insists she's right, and the author sarcastically agrees and then plays a music video full volume on his iPad, causing her to storm off.\n\nSo, the key points here are about public behavior and mutual rudeness. The lady is using a public space without headphones, which can be considered inconsiderate because others can hear her. The author initially tries to ignore it but then gets interrupted by her request. The author's response is defensive, and then he retaliates by doing the same thing she did, which escalates the situation.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the lady was indeed being disruptive by not using headphones, which is a common courtesy in public spaces. On the other hand, the author's response of playing music full volume is also disruptive. However, the author's action was a direct retaliation in response to her initial behavior. \n\nBut here's the thing: even if the lady was at fault, the author's response was to mirror her inconsiderate behavior. While it's true that both parties were being inconsiderate, the author's action was the direct cause of her leaving in anger. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn many social contexts, escalating a conflict by matching the other person's rude behavior, even if they started it, is still considered wrong. The appropriate response would be to address the issue politely without retaliating. Therefore, even though the lady started it by not using headphones, the author's choice to retaliate by playing music loudly was also wrong. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he escalated the situation with his own inconsiderate action.\n"
