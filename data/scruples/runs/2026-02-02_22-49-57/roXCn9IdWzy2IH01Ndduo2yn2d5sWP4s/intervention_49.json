Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where the author is sitting next to an older lady. She's watching a show loudly, and the author puts in earbuds. Then, when the author makes a phone call, she interrupts and asks him to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out that she's the one being rude by not using headphones. Then the author sarcastically agrees and plays a music video full volume, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of both parties. The lady is using her iPad without headphones, which is indeed disruptive in a public setting. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds, which is reasonable. Then, when the lady interrupts the call, the author confronts her politely but points out her own rudeness. The key point is the author's response: after agreeing sarcastically, he plays a music video at full volume. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The initial action of the lady is clearly inconsiderate. However, the author's retaliation by playing a loud music video might be seen as escalating the situation. Even though the author's intent was to show her how she was acting, the act of playing loud media in response could be considered retaliatory and possibly rude in itself. \n\nIn public spaces, while the lady's actions were wrong, the author's response might not be justified. The proper course would be to politely ask her to use headphones without reciprocating in kind. By playing the music video, the author mirrored her behavior, which might be seen as equally rude. Therefore, even though the author had a point, his action could be considered in the wrong because he chose to respond in a similar disruptive manner instead of disengaging or reporting to an authority. \n\nSo the answer would depend on whether retaliation is acceptable. Since public conduct guidelines typically discourage escalating conflicts, the author might be in the wrong for responding with similar behavior. Hence, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
