Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is loudly watching a show on her iPad. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, he responds by pointing out her loudness. After a back-and-forth, the author plays a music video full volume on his own device, causing her to storm off.\n\nSo, the main question is: Was the author right to play the video full volume in response? Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the woman was being loud, which is generally considered rude in public spaces. The author tried to address it politely. The woman then accused him of being rude, which he countered by highlighting her own behavior. Then, he escalates the situation by playing a loud video on his own device. \n\nNow, even though the woman started the problem, the author's response might be seen as retaliatory. While it's true that she was in the wrong initially, responding by also being loud could be problematic. In public spaces, people are expected to maintain a certain level of decorum. If both parties act inconsiderately, it escalates the conflict. The author's action might be seen as a form of \"taste of their own medicine,\" but does that justify his behavior? Legally, maybe not, because he was also violating the same norms. Ethically, it's a gray area. He had a right to ask her to be quiet, but playing a video full volume is a form of retaliation that could be seen as equally rude. \n\nSo, while the woman was the initial wrongdoer, the author's response might not be in the right either. Both acted inconsiderately, but the author's action was a direct and possibly excessive retaliation. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for escalating the situation.\n"
