      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the story is wrong for giving a woman a taste of her own behavior. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author was sitting next to an older lady at the airport. The lady was watching a show on her iPad with the volume up loud. The author initially ignored it and put on earbuds. Then the author made a phone call using the earbuds, but after 30 seconds, the lady asked him to talk quietly because she couldn't hear her show. \n\nThe author responded by pointing out that he could hear her show clearly and that watching a show loudly in public is actually rude, implying that using headphones is the proper way. The lady then claims he's being rude. The author, instead of escalating, apologized and then played a music video full volume on his iPad, which made the lady storm off.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points.\n\nFirst, both parties were engaging in behavior that could be considered disruptive. The lady was using her device without headphones, causing noise. The author made a phone call, which can also be disruptive. However, the author used earbuds for the call, which is generally considered more considerate. The lady interrupted the author's call, so the author responded by playing loud music in retaliation. \n\nThe author's actions were a form of revenge\u2014doing to the lady what she did to him. But is that justified? In public spaces, people have the right to use their devices, but they should do so without disturbing others. The lady's behavior was inconsiderate, but the author's response was even more extreme. Instead of just continuing politely, the author escalated by playing loud music, which is arguably worse because it's a louder and more direct disruption.\n\nAlso, the author initially tried to address the issue calmly, pointing out the lady's behavior. The lady then refused to acknowledge her own fault. The author's final action was a tit-for-tat response, which might not be the right approach. While the lady was in the wrong, the author's retaliation could be seen as equally rude, if not more so. \n\nAnother angle: the author did apologize first, which shows some level of politeness. But then the act of playing loud music was intentional to make the lady feel her own behavior's impact. However, this is a classic \"taste of your own medicine\" approach. The question is whether such retaliation is acceptable. Public spaces often have rules against loud noises, so both actions could be against guidelines. But the author's action was more of a deliberate provocation, which might not be the right way to handle a conflict. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people generally expect others to use headphones. The lady's action was against that norm. The author's phone call, even with earbuds, might be louder if not muffled. But the key is that the author then escalated by playing music loudly. That's a direct mirror of her behavior but possibly even more disruptive. \n\nSo, considering all that, while the lady was in the wrong for not using headphones, the author's retaliation might be seen as equally inappropriate. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for escalating the situation with a deliberate act of disruption. The correct answer would depend on whether the author's action was justified as a lesson or considered rude in itself. Since the author used loud music to retaliate, which is similar to the lady's behavior, the author is also in the wrong.\n"
