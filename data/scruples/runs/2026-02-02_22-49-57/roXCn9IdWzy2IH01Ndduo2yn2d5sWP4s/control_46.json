Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show on her iPad loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly after she criticizes him for his phone call. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The older lady was using her iPad without headphones, which is generally considered rude in public because it's disruptive. The author initially puts in earbuds to avoid the noise, which is a reasonable response. Then, when she interrupts his phone call to complain, he points out her behavior as being rude. She insists she's right, and he sarcastically agrees, then plays a music video loudly to mirror her actions.\n\nNow, the key issue here is whether the author's retaliation was justified. The lady was indeed being rude by not using headphones, but the author's response was to retaliate in kind. Even though he was polite initially, his final action of playing loud video was a direct copy of her behavior. This kind of tit-for-tat can escalate the situation. While the lady was in the wrong first, the author's response might be seen as equally rude. Public spaces require consideration for others, and both parties should avoid disruptive behavior. The author's action, while a response to her rudeness, may not be justified because it also disrupts others. However, the original fault was with the lady. But since he took it upon himself to retaliate in the same way, he's arguably in the wrong because he chose to respond with similar rudeness. So, depending on whether you value mutual respect and de-escalation, the author might be at fault for not maintaining composure and instead matching her behavior.\n"
