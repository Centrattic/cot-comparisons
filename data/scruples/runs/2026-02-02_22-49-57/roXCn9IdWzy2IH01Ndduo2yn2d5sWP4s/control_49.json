Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an older lady playing her show loudly on an iPad at the airport, and the author responds by playing a music video full volume after being reprimanded.\n\nFirst, the lady was being inconsiderate by watching a show at a loud volume in a public place. It's common courtesy to use headphones in such settings. The author initially tried to handle it politely by using earbuds and ignoring it, which is a reasonable approach.\n\nThen, the lady interrupts the author's phone call. The author points out that her behavior is actually the rude one. The lady responds by defending her actions, saying the author is being rude. Here, the author's response shifts. Instead of de-escalating, they play a music video full volume, which is a direct retaliation. \n\nPlaying loud videos in public is also considered rude, similar to the lady's initial behavior. Even though the author was responding to the lady's actions, their retaliation escalated the situation. The key issue here is whether the author's response was proportional. While the lady started the problem, the author's actions mirror her inconsiderate behavior, which could be seen as equally rude. \n\nSo, even though the lady was the first to act inconsiderately, the author's retaliation was not appropriate. Both parties engaged in similar disruptive behavior, but the author's action was a direct response that escalated the conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not maintaining a respectful approach and instead matching the inconsiderate behavior.\n"
