Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing in a situation where they retaliated against a loud woman at the airport.\n\nFirst, the older lady was watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author tried to handle it politely by putting in earbuds and ignoring it. Then when the lady interrupted the author's phone call, the author confronted her, pointing out the irony of her being upset about the phone call while she was being loud herself. \n\nThe key moment is when the author then played a music video at full volume. The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but others might argue that retaliation isn't the best approach. Legally, both parties might have a case depending on airport rules about noise, but the question is more about right vs. wrong behavior.\n\nEthically, the author's initial reaction was to address the issue politely, which is reasonable. However, the retaliation by playing the video full volume could be seen as escalating the conflict unnecessarily. Even if the woman was in the wrong, responding in kind might not be the best strategy. The author's actions could be considered a form of tit-for-tat, which, while understandable, might not be the most constructive or mature response. \n\nOn the other hand, the woman was indeed being inconsiderate, and the author had a point in highlighting her own behavior. But the act of playing loud music in response could be seen as crossing a line, even if it's a form of social justice. There's a balance between defending oneself and creating a hostile environment. \n\nSo, while the woman was definitely at fault for the initial disturbance, the author's retaliation might be seen as equally problematic. The author's actions could be viewed as taking it too far, even if it was in response to the woman's behavior. Therefore, the answer would depend on whether one prioritizes proportionality in conflict resolution. In this case, the author might be in the wrong for escalating the situation with their own loud action, even if their initial confrontations were justified.\n"
