Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then when the author makes a phone call, the lady interrupts them. The author responds politely but then escalates by playing a music video full volume, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the actions. The lady was indeed being inconsiderate by watching her show at a loud volume in public. The author's initial response was to use earbuds and ignore it, which is reasonable. Then, when the lady interrupts the author's call, the author confronts her politely, which also seems fair. The key point is when the author, in a sarcastic manner, plays loud music to mirror the lady's behavior. \n\nIs that retaliation justified? While the lady was in the wrong, the author's response of playing loud music is a direct escalation. Public spaces require mutual respect, so retaliating in kind might not be appropriate even if the other person started it. The author could have instead just ignored the lady's outburst or maybe reported the situation to airport staff if needed. By playing loud music, the author is now creating the same disturbance they were complaining about. That's a problem because it's against the rules of public decency. \n\nSo even though the lady acted first, the author's actions crossed the line. The author's retaliation is not acceptable because it's a tit-for-tat approach that disrupts others. The correct response would be to address the issue politely without mirroring the bad behavior. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for escalating the situation with their own loud behavior.\n"
