Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author did the wrong thing by retaliating against the loud woman at the airport.\n\nFirst, the situation: The lady was watching a show loudly without headphones. The author initially ignored it and used earbuds. When the woman complained about the author's phone call, the author pointed out her own loud behavior. Then, the author played a music video full volume, causing the woman to leave in anger.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's actions after the confrontation are in question. The woman was being inconsiderate by not using headphones, which is common in public spaces. The author addressed it politely at first, which is reasonable. But then, after the woman accused the author of being rude, the author escalated the situation by playing loud music in retaliation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. The initial loud behavior was on the woman, but the author's response of playing loud music full circle might be seen as a form of revenge. Even though the author had a point about the woman's behavior, retaliating in kind could be seen as just as inconsiderate. Public spaces require mutual respect, and while the woman was wrong, the author's response might have crossed a line. However, some might argue it was a justified lesson. But generally, even if someone is being rude, responding with similar behavior might not be the right approach. So, the answer could be A (author is wrong) because they used the same rude behavior as a form of punishment, which isn't helpful. But others might side with B (not wrong) because they were teaching a lesson. I think the correct answer is A because the author's action was a direct retaliation, which is not appropriate even if the initial behavior was wrong. Both sides have points, but the act of playing loud music in response is a form of public disturbance, so the author is at fault.\n"
