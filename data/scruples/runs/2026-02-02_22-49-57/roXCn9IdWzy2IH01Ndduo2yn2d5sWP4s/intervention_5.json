      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is at an airport, where the author is sitting next to an older lady who's watching a show on her iPad at a loud volume. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then, when the author makes a phone call, the lady interrupts to ask them to talk quietly. The author responds politely, pointing out that the lady's loud iPad is actually rude, and then as a form of \"getting back\" at her, the author plays a music video full volume on their own iPad, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nFirst, the initial action of the lady using her iPad loudly is definitely inconsiderate in a public space, especially in an airport where people expect a certain level of quiet. The author's first response is to use earbuds, which is a reasonable way to avoid confrontation. Then, when the lady interrupts the author's phone call, the author confronts her politely, which is appropriate. The lady then claims her right to enjoy her show, which is a bit of a stretch because public spaces require consideration for others.\n\nNow, the key part is the author's retaliation. The author takes the iPad out and plays a loud music video, which is a direct response to the lady's behavior. While the author's initial point is valid (the lady was being inconsiderate), the retaliation is problematic. The author's action is a form of passive-aggressive payback, which escalates the situation rather than resolving it. Even though the lady was inconsiderate, the author's response mirrors the lady's behavior, which was the issue in the first place. So while the lady was wrong, the author's action of playing loud music in response is also inconsiderate and rude in a public setting. Therefore, the author is equally at fault for responding in kind, even if it's a form of \"getting their own back.\"\n"
