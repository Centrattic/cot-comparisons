Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is in an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author uses earbuds and then makes a phone call, which the woman interrupts, asking him to talk quietly. The author responds by pointing out her loud behavior and then retaliates by playing a music video full volume, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were justified. The woman was being inconsiderate by playing her show loudly in public. The author initially tried to be polite by using earbuds and ignoring her. When she interrupted him, he calmly explained that her behavior was rude. However, when she continued to be rude, he played his own video loudly as a form of retaliation.\n\nNow, the key here is the escalation. The author's initial response was reasonable, but retaliating by playing loud video might cross the line. Even though the woman was being rude, the author's action could be seen as equally inconsiderate, especially in a shared public space. Both parties were disruptive, but the author's response might have been an overreaction. The woman had no right to be loud, but the author also shouldn't have responded by being loud in the same way. There's a principle here about not responding to rudeness with similar rudeness. The author might have been trying to teach a lesson, but the method was inappropriate. So, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong because he escalated the situation instead of finding a more appropriate resolution.\n"
