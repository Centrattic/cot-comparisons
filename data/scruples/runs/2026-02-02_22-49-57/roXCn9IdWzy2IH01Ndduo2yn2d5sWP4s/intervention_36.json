Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by playing a loud music video in response to a woman who was watching a show on her iPad at full volume.\n\nFirst, the situation starts with the older lady using her iPad loudly. The author initially ignores it and puts in earbuds. Then, when the author makes a phone call, the lady interrupts, asking him to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out her loud behavior. She claims she has the right to enjoy her show, and he sarcastically agrees but then plays loud music in response. She storms off.\n\nSo, the key points here are about public etiquette and mutual respect. The lady was being rude by not using headphones, which is a common courtesy in public spaces. The author tried to address it politely but was met with hostility. His response of playing loud music as a form of retaliation might be seen as escalating the conflict. While he was defending his right to make a call (which is reasonable), using loud music as a countermeasure could be considered equally rude. The author's action might not be the \"wrong\" in terms of intent, but in terms of action, it's a tit-for-tat that's also impolite. So, while both parties have points, the author's response was probably not the best way to handle the situation. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for retaliating instead of de-escalating.\n"
