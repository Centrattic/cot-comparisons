Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show on her iPad very loudly. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then, when the woman interrupts the author during a phone call, the author responds by pointing out the woman's behavior as rude. The woman claims her right to enjoy her show, and the author sarcastically agrees, then plays a music video full volume on their own device, causing the woman to leave in anger.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are about public etiquette and mutual respect. When the woman played her show loudly, that's clearly disruptive in a public space where quiet is expected. The author's initial response was to use earbuds and then politely address the woman during a phone call. The woman's interruption was rude, so the author's response might be seen as justified in a way, but the escalation by playing music full volume is questionable.\n\nThe author's sarcastic agreement and then retaliating by playing loud music could be seen as tit for tat, but is that acceptable? Public spaces require consideration. Even if someone else is being rude, responding with the same behavior might not be the right approach. The author's action could be viewed as equally rude, even if it's a response to the woman's initial behavior. So, while the woman started it, the author's actions might still be considered inconsiderate. However, the initial provocation might mitigate some of the blame. The question is whether both parties share responsibility. In terms of right and wrong, the author might not be entirely at fault since the woman was the first to be disruptive, but the author's response could be seen as equally disruptive. So maybe it's a shared responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). Depending on the perspective, if the author's retaliation is considered as wrong as the initial action, then A. But if the author was just giving her own medicine, then B. It's a bit of a gray area, but the key is that both acted rudely. However, since the author responded to being interrupted, maybe the author's actions are a form of self-defense in a way, but in public settings, loudness from either side isn't acceptable. So, perhaps the author is still in the wrong because retaliating with loud music isn't the right approach. But maybe not entirely. Hmm.\n"
