Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author puts in earbuds, ignores it, but when the lady interrupts the author's phone call, the author responds politely and then retaliates by playing a music video loudly, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The lady was indeed being rude by watching her show at a loud volume in a public place. The author tried to address it politely, pointing out the lady's behavior. However, when the lady criticized the author for using the phone, the author escalated the situation by playing a loud music video. \n\nThe key here is the mutual rudeness. The lady started by being inconsiderate, but the author's retaliation was also disruptive. Even though the author had a reason to be upset, responding in kind by playing loud media isn't acceptable either. Both parties were inconsiderate, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn public spaces, both individuals have a responsibility to be considerate. The author's initial response was reasonable, but the escalation by playing loud music was inappropriate. So technically, both are wrong. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer might be yes because the author could have handled it without retaliating. Alternatively, if the lady was already wrong, the author's action might be seen as justified. But generally, responding with the same behavior isn't considered right. So the answer is likely A (author is wrong).\n"
