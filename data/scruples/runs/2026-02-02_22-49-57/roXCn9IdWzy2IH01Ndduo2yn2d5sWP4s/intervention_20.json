Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author initially ignores her and puts in earbuds. When the lady interrupts the author's phone call to ask him to be quiet, the author responds politely but then retaliates by playing a music video loudly, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The lady was being inconsiderate by not using headphones in a public space. The author first tries to handle it calmly by using earbuds and then politely explaining the situation. However, when the lady confronts him, he escalates the situation by playing music loudly, which is similar to her initial behavior. \n\nThe key point here is whether the author's retaliation was justified. While the lady was wrong for not using headphones, the author's response might have been an overreaction. Instead of continuing the argument, he chose to mirror her behavior, which could be seen as a form of revenge. Even though the author was polite in his explanation, the act of playing loud music in response could be considered equally rude. Public spaces require mutual respect, and while the lady was at fault, the author's retaliation might have crossed a line. So, the author's actions, although a form of giving her a taste of her own behavior, might not be the right approach. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong for escalating the situation rather than de-escalating it.\n"
