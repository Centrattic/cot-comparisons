Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author responds politely but then plays a music video full volume, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nHmm. First, public manners are important. The woman was being disruptive by not using headphones, which is generally expected in such settings. The author tried to address it politely when interrupted. But then the author decided to play a loud video in response, which is a form of retaliation.\n\nNow, the key point is whether the author's action of playing loud music was justified. While the initial complaint from the woman was rude, retaliating with loud music might not be the best response. However, the author was responding to someone who was already being loud. The question is about being \"in the wrong.\"\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, both sides have done things that are socially unacceptable. The woman was clearly at fault for not using headphones. The author, while polite initially, then chose to escalate the situation by playing loud music, which is equally rude. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe author's action was a direct response, so some might argue it's even, but others might say that retaliating is still wrong. But since the woman started the disruption, the author's response could be seen as a justified reaction in the heat of the moment. However, playing loud music is not a socially acceptable response, regardless of the provocation. So technically, the author's action was also rude. But maybe not in the wrong in the eyes of some, especially if they see it as a fair response to the woman's behavior. \n\nI think the answer depends on social norms. Public spaces require mutual respect. Both parties failed to uphold that. But the author's action was a form of payback, which might not be the right approach, but perhaps not entirely in the wrong given the context. However, the correct choice would be B (not in the wrong) because the woman was already violating the norm first, and the author's response, while not ideal, was a reaction to that. But maybe the author is in the wrong for retaliating. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. I think the answer is B because the woman was the initial offender, and the author's response, while not great, was a reaction to her behavior. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
