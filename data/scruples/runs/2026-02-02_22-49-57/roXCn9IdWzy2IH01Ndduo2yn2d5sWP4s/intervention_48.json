Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario starts with an older lady sitting next to the author and watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds, then makes a phone call. The woman interrupts to ask him to talk quieter. He responds politely but then points out her loud behavior is rude. She retorts that he's the one being rude, and he sarcastically agrees and then plays a music video loudly, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the rules of public spaces. Generally, people are expected to use headphones in places like airports to avoid disturbing others. The woman's loud iPad use is probably a violation of that norm. The author's initial response was to politely point this out, which seems reasonable. But then he takes it a step further by playing a music video full volume, which is also loud and disruptive. Even though he was reacting to her behavior, his action is similar to hers, just with different content.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's retaliation is justified. While the woman was indeed being rude, responding in kind by playing loud media isn't a constructive solution. It escalates the conflict and causes her to leave angrily. The author's action, while perhaps a form of getting back at her, is still disruptive. So even though the woman started it, the author's response crosses the line into being equally inconsiderate. Public spaces require mutual respect, and responding with the same behavior doesn't help. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he chose to retaliate in a way that was also disruptive, despite starting with a polite approach.\n"
