Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad, and the author ends up playing a music video full volume in response.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the timeline. The woman is being loud, the author uses earbuds and makes a phone call. The woman interrupts the call to ask him to be quiet. The author responds politely, pointing out the woman's behavior is rude. Then he sarcastically says he's wrong and proceeds to play loud music, causing her to leave in anger.\n\nSo, the key points are: both were using devices, but the woman was doing it without headphones, which is indeed impolite in public. The author initially tried to address it politely. However, his response of playing loud music in retaliation might be problematic. While the woman was in the wrong for not using headphones, the author's reaction could be seen as escalating the situation. Retaliation might not be the best approach, even if the other person is at fault. The author's action could be considered equally rude, even if it was a form of payback. So, while the woman was wrong first, the author's response might make him equally at fault for the conflict. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because both parties acted inappropriately, and the author's retaliation was not a justified response.\n"
