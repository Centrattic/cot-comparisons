Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a conflict in an airport between the author and an older lady.\n\nFirst, the lady is watching her show on an iPad loudly. The author puts in earbuds to ignore it. Then the author makes a phone call using the earbuds. The lady interrupts to tell the author to talk quieter. The author responds by pointing out that her show is loud and that using headphones is standard. Then the author sarcastically complies by playing a music video loudly on their own device, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nLegally, in public spaces, people aren't allowed to disrupt others. The lady's loud iPad use could be seen as disruptive, just like the author's phone call. But when the author retaliated by playing music loudly, that's a direct response that escalates the situation. Even if the author felt wronged, retaliating in kind might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe author's actions led to the lady leaving, which resolved the conflict, but the method was confrontational. Retaliation isn't always considered appropriate, even if the initial action was rude. So while the lady was at fault for not using headphones, the author's response might be seen as equally rude. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often judge others for being inconsiderate. The author's sarcastic compliance might have been an overreaction. So, the author could be seen as wrong for responding with equal inconsideration. But others might argue it was justified to show the lady her own mistake. \n\nBut from a strict standpoint, both actions (loud show and loud music) were disruptive. However, the author's response was a direct retaliation, which might be considered wrong because it's not a constructive solution. The correct approach would be to ask politely or inform the staff. \n\nSo, the author's action of playing loud music was a form of revenge and not a respectful resolution. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
