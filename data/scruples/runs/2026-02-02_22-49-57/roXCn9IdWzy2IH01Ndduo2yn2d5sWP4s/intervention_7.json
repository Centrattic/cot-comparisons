Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older woman is watching a show loudly, and the author ends up playing a music video full volume in response. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the events step by step. The older lady sits next to the author, uses her iPad at loud volume, and the author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then, when the author makes a phone call, the woman interrupts to ask him to be quieter. The author responds by pointing out that her behavior is actually rude, which is why people use headphones. She gets defensive, and the author then plays a loud music video on his own device, leading her to storm off.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect in public spaces and the escalation of the conflict. The author initially tried to avoid confrontation by using earbuds, but when the woman interrupts his call, he decides to retaliate. The question is whether the author's retaliation was justified or if it made him at fault.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, both parties have some responsibility. The woman was using her device loudly, which is generally considered rude in public places. The author, however, could have handled the situation more calmly. Instead of calling her out and then playing a loud video, he might have chosen to address her request politely without escalating the conflict. By playing the music video, he mirrored her behavior, which is often seen as a form of retaliation rather than a solution.\n\nThe author's action could be seen as taking the moral high ground by pointing out her mistake but then responding in kind. While the woman was indeed at fault for not using headphones, the author's response might have been excessive. Public spaces require a certain level of consideration, and responding with the same rude behavior can be just as problematic. Therefore, even though the woman started it, the author's action could be considered in the wrong because he chose to retaliate instead of resolving the issue peacefully.\n"
