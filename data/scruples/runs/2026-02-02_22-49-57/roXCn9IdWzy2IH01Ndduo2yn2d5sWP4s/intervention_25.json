Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is at an airport, and an older lady sits next to them and watches a show loudly. The author puts in their earbuds to ignore it. Then, when the author makes a phone call, the lady interrupts to ask them to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out that the lady's behavior is actually rude because she's not using headphones, and then as a reaction, the author plays a music video loudly on their own device. The lady storms off mad.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. First, I need to consider the norms of public spaces. Generally, using headphones for media consumption is expected to avoid disturbing others. The lady was using her iPad without headphones, which is considered impolite. The author tried to ignore it by using their own earbuds first. Then, when the lady complained, the author defended their phone call as not being rude, which is a fair point since phone calls can be necessary but should be kept quiet.\n\nBut then the author took it a step further by playing a music video full volume. That's definitely not okay. Even if the author was annoyed, retaliating by making the same disturbance is counterproductive and escalates the situation. The initial response was polite and reasonable, but the action of playing loud media was a direct provocation. So while the lady was in the wrong for not using headphones, the author's revenge action was not justified. The correct answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they chose to reciprocate in a way that's also inconsiderate and rude. Even if the lady was being rude, the author's response crossed the line. It's important to address issues calmly without taking revenge.\n"
