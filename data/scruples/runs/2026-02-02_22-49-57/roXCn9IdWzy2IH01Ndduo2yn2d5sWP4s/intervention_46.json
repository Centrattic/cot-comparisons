Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds, then makes a phone call, which the woman interrupts, asking him to be quiet. The author responds politely but then escalates by playing a music video on his iPad at full volume, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The woman's behavior is clearly problematic; watching a show at loud volume in a public space without headphones is generally considered rude. The author initially tries to avoid confrontation by using earbuds, which is reasonable. When the woman interrupts his call, the author politely points out her mistake. But then he retaliates by playing loud music, which mirrors her behavior. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's retaliation is justified. While the woman was wrong to be loud, the author's response of playing loud music is a form of tit-for-tat. Public spaces require mutual respect, and even if someone is being rude, responding in kind can escalate the situation. However, there's a common saying about giving someone a taste of their own medicine, which some might see as poetic justice. \n\nBut legally and socially, both actions are violations of public courtesy. The woman was wrong first, but the author's response was also rude. However, the initial question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he escalated the conflict after a polite response, some might argue he crossed the line. Others might say he was simply showing her the consequence of her actions. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The woman's actions are clearly rude, but the author's retaliation is also rude. However, the user's interpretation is that the author isn't wrong because he was reacting to the woman's initial rudeness. So, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions are seen as a justified response or an escalation. In many cases, even if someone is wrong, responding in kind isn't considered acceptable. So there's a case for A (author is wrong). But if you take the view that the author's actions are a fair response to the woman's behavior, then B (not wrong). \n\nBut I think the key here is that the author, after being polite, chose to mirror the woman's behavior, which is a form of revenge rather than a solution. So, while the woman was at fault first, the author's action of playing loud music is also wrong. So the answer would be A. But others might see it as justified.\n"
