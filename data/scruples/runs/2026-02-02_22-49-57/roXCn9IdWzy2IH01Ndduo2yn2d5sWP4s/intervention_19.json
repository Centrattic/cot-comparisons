Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a conflict at an airport between the author and an older lady. The key points are:\n\n1. The lady sits next to the author and watches a show loudly on her iPad.\n2. The author ignores it initially but uses earbuds and then makes a phone call.\n3. The lady interrupts the call, asking the author to speak quietly.\n4. The author responds politely but points out the lady's loud behavior is rude.\n5. The lady insists she has the right to enjoy her show without being disturbed.\n6. The author then plays a music video full volume on their iPad, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants confirmation. So, is the author at fault?\n\nFirst, consider public etiquette. In public spaces, people are expected to be considerate. The lady's loud iPad usage is clearly inconsiderate, as it affects others. The author's initial reaction was to ignore it, which is reasonable. When the lady interrupts the phone call, the author responds politely but also calls out the lady's behavior. This is fair because the lady's actions were the initial problem.\n\nHowever, the author then retaliates by playing the music video at full volume. This is a direct provocation. Even though the author was defending their own actions, responding in kind by being equally inconsiderate might be seen as the author taking it too far. While the lady was wrong first, the author's retaliation could be considered in the wrong because they chose to escalate the situation rather than defuse it. The author's actions during the retaliation might not be justified, even if the lady was being rude. The key point is that mutual inconsiderate behavior isn't acceptable, regardless of who started it.\n\nSo, while the lady was initially at fault, the author's choice to play music loudly in response could make them equally or more at fault. Therefore, the answer might be A, yes, the author is in the wrong because they escalated the conflict with their own rude behavior.\n"
