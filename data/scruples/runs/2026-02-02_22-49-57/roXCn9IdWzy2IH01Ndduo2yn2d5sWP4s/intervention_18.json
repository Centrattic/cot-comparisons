Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is at an airport where an older woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author, initially ignoring it, puts on earbuds. Then, when making a phone call, the woman interrupts asking him to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out her loudness and then, after agreeing she's right, plays a music video full volume, leading her to leave in anger.\n\nFirst, the woman's actions: watching a show loudly in public is indeed disruptive. Public spaces typically have expectations of low noise. The author's initial response of using earbuds is reasonable to avoid conflict. When the woman interrupts the call, the author confronts her politely, which makes sense because both parties are in a shared space.\n\nHowever, the key point is the author's retaliation. Even though the woman was being loud, the author took it a step further by playing loud video. This seems like a direct provocation. While the initial confrontation was a valid response to the woman's behavior, escalating the situation by playing loud media might be crossing a line. The author's actions led to the woman leaving angrily, which could be seen as unnecessary. Public settings require mutual respect; responding in kind might not be the best approach, even if the other person started it. The author's actions could be viewed as equally rude, even if they were reacting to the woman's behavior. So, while the woman was in the wrong first, the author's retaliation might place some responsibility on them for escalating the conflict.\n"
