Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is at an airport and a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. He puts in his earbuds but then makes a phone call, which she interrupts, asking him to be quiet. He responds by saying her behavior is rude and then plays a music video loudly on his iPad, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, public spaces like airports have etiquette. People generally expect others to use headphones for audio. The woman was being loud, which is indeed rude. The man tried to ignore her at first, then made a phone call, which she found rude. He pointed out her fault, which is fair, but then escalated by playing a loud video. Even though he was retaliating, his actions were also loud and disruptive. So, both sides have issues. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. His response was a direct retaliation. While he had a point about her behavior, playing loud music after being told to be quiet might cross the line. So, he's not entirely at fault, but his action was also rude. However, the initial act of the woman was worse. The answer might be B (No) because he was responding to her wrongdoing, but maybe there's a nuance. Wait, the user asks if the author is in the wrong. The author's action was a form of giving her a taste of her own medicine, which is a common saying for reciprocating bad behavior. But in reality, both actions are rude. However, in the context of the situation, he had already been told to quiet his phone call, and then he ignored her and made it worse. So maybe he is in the wrong. But the woman started it. Hmm, this is tricky. The key is whether the author's actions were justified. Even if the woman was being rude, responding by being equally rude might not be appropriate. So, he might be in the wrong for escalating the situation. But in some perspectives, he was showing her the consequence of her actions. However, in a public setting, both sides have responsibilities. The answer is likely B (No) because the author was highlighting her own rude behavior by doing the same, but maybe A (Yes) because he shouldn't have retaliated. Let me check again. The woman was being loud. He points out that she's being rude and then does the same. So, he's in the wrong for doing the same thing he criticized her for. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes). Wait, but he was trying to make a point. However, the actual action of playing loud music after being told to be quiet is also rude, so he's in the wrong. So Answer: A.\n"
