Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is in an airport, next to a woman who's watching a show loudly. The author uses earbuds and even makes a phone call. The woman interrupts to ask the author to talk quietly. The author then argues that the woman is being rude by not using headphones and then retaliates by playing music loudly, causing the woman to leave in anger.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case. Now, I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nThe initial conflict: the woman is using her device without headphones, which is disturbing others. The author uses earbuds, so maybe they expected others to do the same. When the author makes a phone call, the woman gets annoyed and tells them to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out the woman's behavior is rude. Then the author plays music loudly, leading to the woman's anger.\n\nLegally, in public spaces, people are expected to be considerate. The woman's loud show is disruptive. The author's phone call, while perhaps louder, might be considered a more direct form of communication. However, using earbuds for calls is less disruptive. The author's response was to retaliate by playing music loudly. That seems like a direct provocation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the woman started the problem by being loud. The author tried to address it politely. But then, when confronted, the author escalated the situation by playing music. Even if the author felt justified, retaliating in kind could be seen as wrong because it's not solving the problem but creating a worse one. Public spaces require mutual respect. So even if the woman was at fault first, the author's response might still be considered in the wrong for escalating.\n\nBut maybe the author was just giving her a taste of her own medicine, which some might find justified. However, morally or legally, retaliation isn't typically the right approach. The correct action would be to either continue ignoring or perhaps involve an airport authority, not to mimic the woman's behavior. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for escalating, even if the initial issue was the woman's fault.\n"
