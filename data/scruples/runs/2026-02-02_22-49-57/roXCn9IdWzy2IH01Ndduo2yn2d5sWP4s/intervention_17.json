Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older woman is watching a show loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly as well. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of both parties. The woman is using her iPad without headphones, which is indeed disruptive in a public space. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author confronts her politely, pointing out the issue. The woman responds by accusing the author of being rude. The author then plays a music video loudly, leading the woman to leave angry.\n\nSo, the key points are: both are using their devices without headphones, which is against airport etiquette. The author's initial response is to point out the woman's behavior, which is reasonable. However, retaliating by playing music full volume seems to mirror the woman's actions. While the author's point about the woman's rudeness is valid, the response might be seen as equally rude. The author is using the same method to make a point, but that could be considered a tit-for-tat approach rather than a constructive resolution.\n\nIn public spaces, mutual respect and minimizing disruption are key. Both parties failed to use headphones, which is the expected norm. The author's response, while perhaps a humorous or exaggerated way to highlight the issue, might not be the most appropriate method. However, the author's initial confrontation was polite, and the retaliation could be seen as a justified response to being accused of rudeness. But since both were at fault, the author's action could be seen as equally disruptive. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for retaliating in the same manner. But I'm a bit conflicted. The woman started the problem, but the author escalated it. Depending on cultural norms, some might see it as fair, others as wrong. Legally, neither is breaking a law, but socially, both are in the wrong for not using headphones. The author's retaliation, while highlighting the issue, is also disruptive. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they reciprocated the behavior, even if the woman was initially at fault.\n"
