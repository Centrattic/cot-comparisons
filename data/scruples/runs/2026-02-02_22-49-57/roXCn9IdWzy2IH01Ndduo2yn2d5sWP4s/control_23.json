Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show on her iPad without headphones, loud enough that others can hear. The person telling the story (the author) initially ignores it, puts in their earbuds. Then when they make a phone call, the woman interrupts them to ask them to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out the woman's loud show as the problem. The woman gets defensive, and the author then plays a loud music video on their own device, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess who's in the wrong here. Public spaces have certain expectations about noise. Typically, it's considered polite to use headphones in public to avoid disturbing others. The woman was watching her show loudly, which is probably frowned upon. The author tried to handle it politely by ignoring it at first, then using earbuds to block out the noise. When the woman complained about the phone call, the author pointed out her own behavior. But then the author escalated the situation by playing loud video, which is the reverse of what the woman was doing. \n\nSo, the woman was in the wrong first by not using headphones. But the author's response was to play loud music themselves, which is also violating the same rule they were criticizing. Instead of calmly explaining the issue without retaliating, the author mirrored the woman's behavior, which probably made things worse. Retaliation isn't helpful; addressing the issue calmly is better. The author's action of playing loud music was a direct response to the woman's complaint, which shows a lack of restraint. Even though the woman was wrong initially, the author's choice to respond in kind means they also did something wrong. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation maturely and escalated it.\n"
