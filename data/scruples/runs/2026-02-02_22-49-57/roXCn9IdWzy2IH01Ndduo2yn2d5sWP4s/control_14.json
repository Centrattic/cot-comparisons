Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about an airport incident where a woman is watching a show loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly. I need to determine if the author was wrong.\n\nFirst, the lady was being loud, which is generally considered rude in public. The author initially tried to ignore it and even used earbuds. Then, when the lady complained about the phone call, the author defended their actions and pointed out her loudness. Then, the author escalated by playing a loud video. \n\nSo, the key points: the author's actions were a direct retaliation. Even though the lady was being rude, the author's response was to play something even louder. This seems like taking the argument to an extreme. Public places have etiquette about not disturbing others, so both parties might have some responsibility. But the author's action of playing loud music after the initial complaint might be more confrontational. \n\nThe lady had a right to ask to be heard, but the author's response was to do the same. However, using loud devices in public is generally frowned upon, so the author's action was also rude. Even if the original behavior was rude, the author's reaction might be seen as equally problematic. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they escalated the situation instead of de-escalating. Retaliation isn't the right approach, even if the other person started it. So answer A.\n"
