Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly, and the author, after being interrupted by her, retaliates by playing a music video loudly. \n\nFirst, the initial issue: the woman is using an iPad without headphones, which is indeed disruptive in a public space. The author tries to handle it politely by putting in earbuds and making a phone call. Then the woman interrupts the call, so the author confronts her. The confrontation leads to the author playing loud music as a form of retaliation.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. The woman was being rude by not using headphones, which the author points out. But the author's response is to play loud music, which is the same behavior. Even though the author argues that phone calls aren't inherently rude, the problem was the volume and the fact that the woman wasn't using headphones. The author's retaliation is tit-for-tat, which might be seen as escalating the situation. \n\nLegally, both parties might have the same rights in a public space, but socially, using headphones is expected. The author's action of playing loud music is a direct response, which could be seen as equally rude. Even though the author was correcting the woman's behavior, the method of retaliation was the same as the initial offense. So, while the author had a point about the woman's behavior, the way they responded might put them in the wrong. It's a bit of a tricky situation where both might have contributed to the conflict. But since the author took the action of playing loud music, which is the same as what they criticized the woman for, they might be in the wrong for not setting a better example.\n"
