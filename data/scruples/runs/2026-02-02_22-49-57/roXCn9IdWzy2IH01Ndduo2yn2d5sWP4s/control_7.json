Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older woman is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author initially ignores her but then uses earbuds to make a phone call. The woman interrupts him, asking him to talk quieter. He responds politely, pointing out that she's being rude by not using headphones. She insists she's right, and he then pretends to agree but plays a loud music video in retaliation. The woman gets angry and storms off.\n\nSo, the key points here are about public etiquette and mutual respect. The woman was being inconsiderate by not using headphones, which the author rightly points out. However, the author's response of playing loud music in full view is a form of retaliation. Even though he was provoked, responding with the same behavior might escalate the situation. The question is whether his retaliation makes him at fault.\n\nLegally, neither is in the wrong, but socially, both acted inconsiderately. The author's initial response was reasonable\u2014pointing out the issue politely. But the retaliation by playing loud music is where things go wrong. He used her own tactics against her, which might be seen as equally rude. Airports often have rules against loud noises, so both could be violating policies. However, the author's action was a direct response, which could be considered an overreaction. Even if he had a point about her behavior, his method of \"teaching her a lesson\" might not be the best approach. So, while his initial complaint was reasonable, the retaliation could be seen as the wrong move. Therefore, the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong for his retaliatory action.\n"
