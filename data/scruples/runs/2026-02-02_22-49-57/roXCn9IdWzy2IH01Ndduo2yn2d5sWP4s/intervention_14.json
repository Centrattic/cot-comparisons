Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves someone in an airport who's annoyed by a lady watching a show loudly. The person initially ignores it by putting in earbuds but then makes a phone call, which the woman interrupts. The person responds by telling the woman her behavior is rude and then retaliates by playing a loud music video, causing the woman to get angry.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The woman was using her iPad without headphones, which is indeed inconsiderate in a public space. The person using the phone call was being polite initially but then escalated the situation by playing loud music after being told to be quiet. The key here is whether the retaliation was justified.\n\nPublic spaces generally require everyone to be considerate. The woman's action of not using headphones is rude, as it affects others. The person on the phone was within their right to make a call but perhaps shouldn't have used it as a reason to play loud music. However, the person did point out the woman's behavior was rude first. The retaliation might be seen as a form of getting back at her, which could be excessive. But since the woman started it by being loud, the person might feel justified. However, playing loud music isn't a good response. So there's a conflict here between both parties acting inconsiderately. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to determine if the author's actions were acceptable. The answer likely depends on societal norms about public behavior and whether retaliation is justified. The author's action might be seen as taking a stand against inconsiderate behavior, but it's also a form of escalation. The correct answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author was responding to someone's inconsiderate action, albeit in a reciprocated way. However, some might argue that the author's retaliation was also inconsiderate. But since the woman started it, the author's actions could be viewed as a necessary correction. So leaning towards B.\n"
