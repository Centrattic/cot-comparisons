Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author did something wrong in the airport situation. The scenario involves an older lady watching a show loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly in return.\n\nFirst, the lady was being disruptive by watching her show at high volume. The author initially tried to avoid confrontation by using earbuds. Then, when the lady asked the author to be quiet during a phone call, the author pointed out the irony of her behavior. The author then escalated by playing loud music themselves, leading to the lady storming off.\n\nLegally and socially, using headphones in public is common to avoid disturbing others. The lady's action was rude, but the author's retaliation by playing loud music was also inappropriate. While the author was responding to a rude action, using the same tactic doesn't make it right. The correct approach would be to address the issue politely without reciprocating the rudeness. So, the author's action, though a form of giving back, is still in the wrong because they chose an equally disruptive method.\n"
