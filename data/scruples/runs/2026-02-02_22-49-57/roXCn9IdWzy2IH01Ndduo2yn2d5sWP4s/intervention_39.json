Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly in return.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The lady is being disruptive by using her iPad without headphones. The author initially ignores it by using earbuds. Then, when the lady confronts the author during a phone call, the author argues back and then plays a video loudly on their own device. The key here is whether the author's retaliation makes them at fault.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not wrong. But legally and socially, both parties might be in the wrong. The lady was indeed being rude by not using headphones in a public space. However, the author's response of playing loud music in return is a form of retaliation. While the author is defending their point, retaliating in kind might not be the best approach, even if the initial action was wrong. Both actions are disruptive, so the author's action could be seen as equally rude. \n\nBut socially, sometimes people expect a certain level of accountability. The author's response was a direct consequence to the lady's action, which might be seen as justified in terms of teaching a lesson. However, legally or ethically, both parties could be at fault for causing disturbances. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author took it upon themselves to respond in kind, that might be considered wrong because it escalates the situation instead of resolving it. So maybe the answer is A, but I'm a bit conflicted because the initial provocation was from the lady. But the author's action was a direct retaliation, which is problematic. Hmm.\n"
