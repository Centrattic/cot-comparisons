Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a person at an airport dealing with a woman who's watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it but then when the woman interrupts their phone call, they confront her. Then the author plays a music video loudly in response, causing the woman to leave.\n\nSo, first, I need to assess both sides. The woman was using her iPad without headphones, which is indeed rude in public. The author's initial response was to put on earbuds and make a phone call. The woman then interrupts the author's call, which is a direct conflict. The author responds by pointing out the woman's behavior and then escalating by playing loud video. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's retaliation was justified. The woman was being inconsiderate, but the author's response was to play a music video at full volume. That seems like a tit-for-tat approach. While the woman was wrong for being loud, the author's action of playing loud video could be seen as equally rude. Public spaces require mutual respect, so even if someone else is being loud, retaliating with loudness isn't the best solution. \n\nBut the author did point out the woman's behavior first. However, after that, the author's own action caused the woman to leave. The question is about whether the author was in the wrong. Legally, maybe not, but socially, escalating the situation by being loud in response might not be the right approach. The author could have simply ignored it again or politely asked her to lower the volume. But instead, they chose to retaliate, which could be seen as equally rude. \n\nSo considering all that, even though the woman started it, the author's response was a form of revenge rather than a constructive resolution. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for responding in kind, even if the initial action was more inconsiderate. So the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
