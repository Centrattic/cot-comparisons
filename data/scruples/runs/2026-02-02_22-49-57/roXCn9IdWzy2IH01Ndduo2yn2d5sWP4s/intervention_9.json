Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the airport story is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman watching a show loudly on her iPad, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly after being scolded.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the initial behavior. The lady is using her device without headphones, which is indeed a common etiquette issue in public spaces. The author initially tries to handle it by using earbuds, which is a reasonable response to avoid confrontation.\n\nWhen the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author points out the hypocrisy. The key point here is whether the author's response is justified. The woman's action is rude, so pointing that out is valid. However, the author then takes it further by playing a loud music video, which could be seen as retaliating in kind. \n\nNow, is retaliation acceptable? In public, mutual disruption isn't a good precedent. While the woman was the first to be inconsiderate, the author's response escalates the situation. Playing music loudly in an airport is also a breach of public etiquette, regardless of the reason. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as a form of passive-aggressive payback, which doesn't resolve the issue and could provoke more conflict. Even if the woman was wrong, the author's response isn't the best way to handle it. \n\nSo, while the woman was clearly at fault initially, the author's escalation might place some responsibility on them for not de-escalating the situation. Public spaces require mutual respect, and both parties should strive to be considerate. The author's action, though a humorous comeuppance, isn't a model solution. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, but it's a nuanced case.\n"
