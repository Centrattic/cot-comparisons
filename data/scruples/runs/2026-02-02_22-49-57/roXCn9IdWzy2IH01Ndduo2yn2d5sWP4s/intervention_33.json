Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong in the airport situation. The scenario is that a woman was watching a show loudly on her iPad, and the author was on a phone call when she asked him to be quiet. The author then responded by saying she was right and then played a loud music video himself, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze who had the right in the initial conflict. Public spaces often have unspoken rules about noise levels. The woman was using her iPad without headphones, which can disturb others. The author, when asked to be quiet, pointed out that her behavior was actually the issue. She claimed her right to enjoy her show, but the author countered that public etiquette requires using headphones. \n\nNow, the key part is the author's retaliation. He took her own argument and applied it literally\u2014by playing loud music himself. This seems like a form of getting her to experience her own behavior. But is this justified? In many places, there's a limit to how you can respond to someone else's actions. Retaliation, even in a humorous way, might not be the right approach. The woman might have been in the wrong for being loud, but the author's response could escalate the situation and potentially be seen as equally rude.\n\nPublic spaces require mutual respect. While the woman was in the wrong initially, the author's response of playing loud music could be considered a breach of that respect. It's a form of payback, which might not be the best way to resolve a conflict. The author's action might have been meant to highlight the hypocrisy, but in reality, it's just another form of being inconsiderate. \n\nSo, depending on the context, the author might be in the wrong for retaliating in a way that mirrors the woman's behavior. Even though the woman started it, the author's response could be seen as equally disruptive. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, but I need to make sure. However, the user's own opinion is that the author isn't wrong, so maybe the answer is B. But from a strict standpoint, the author's action was inappropriate. Hence, probably A.\n"
