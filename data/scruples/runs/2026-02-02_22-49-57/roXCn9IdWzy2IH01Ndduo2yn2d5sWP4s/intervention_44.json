Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author initially ignores it and puts in earbuds. Then, when the author makes a phone call, the woman interrupts to ask him to talk quietly. The author responds politely but points out that her loud show is actually rude. Then the author sarcastically agrees to her being right and plays a music video full volume, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of public spaces. Typically, in public areas like airports, people are expected to use headphones for audio to avoid disturbing others. The woman wasn't using headphones, so she might be at fault for the loud show. The author was using earbuds for his phone call, which is appropriate, but when he makes a call, he's speaking aloud. However, in some airports, there might be quiet hours or expectations to keep calls to a minimum, but it's not always clear.\n\nWhen the woman asks him to be quiet, the author responds by pointing out her own behavior. That seems fair because she's the one not using headphones. But then he takes it a step further by sarcastically agreeing and then playing a music video loudly. This seems like retaliation. Even though he was pointing out her mistake, responding by playing loud music himself might be crossing a line. It's one thing to correct someone politely and another to take their own action to \"teach them a lesson,\" especially in a public setting where it could disturb others even more.\n\nSo, while the initial conflict might have been the woman's fault, the author's response of playing loud music could be seen as inconsiderate. The author used her own behavior against her, but by doing so, he created a worse disturbance. That action might not be appropriate even if it's a form of karma. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for escalating the situation instead of just maintaining his own polite response without retaliating.\n"
