Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman in an airport who's watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author, when making a phone call, is interrupted by the woman asking him to be quiet. He responds by pointing out her loudness and then retaliates by playing a music video full volume, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The woman is using a public space without headphones, which is generally considered impolite. The author initially ignores her but when she confronts him about his phone call, he responds by playing loud music. \n\nThe key here is the concept of reciprocity. While the woman was indeed being inconsiderate by not using headphones, the author's response was to escalate the situation by playing loud music himself. Even if he was provoked, his retaliation might be seen as equally rude. Public spaces often require mutual respect; responding with similar rudeness could be seen as the author being in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the author's actions of playing the music video full volume without headphones mirrors the woman's behavior. This might not be justified, even if he was correcting her. The appropriate response would have been to politely insist on her using headphones without reciprocating the loudness. \n\nSo, while the woman started the problem, the author's decision to match her behavior with his own loud actions makes him at fault. The right approach would have been to address the issue without escalating it. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
