Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about an airport where an older lady is watching a show on her iPad loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly as well. The key points here are about mutual rudeness and whether the author's retaliation was justified.\n\nFirst, the lady was being inconsiderate by watching her show without headphones, which is disruptive in a public space. The author initially tried to handle it politely by putting in earbuds, which is a reasonable first step. When the lady interrupted the author's phone call, the author confronted her politely, pointing out the hypocrisy. The lady then doubled down, claiming her rights. The author then retaliated by playing loud music, leading the lady to storm off.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the lady started the problem by being loud. On the other, the author's response was to escalate the situation by playing music loudly. While the lady's initial behavior was rude, the author's action could also be seen as retaliatory and equally inconsiderate. Public spaces generally expect people to respect others' comfort, so both might have overstepped. However, the lady was the first to act rudely, and the author's response was a form of giving her own behavior back. The author might argue that the lady's actions warranted a response to teach her a lesson. But in terms of right and wrong, the author's action was also a form of public disruption. So it's a bit of a gray area. But considering the lady started it, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. Alternatively, the author's retaliation might be seen as equally wrong, making them both responsible. However, since the question is about the author specifically, and the lady was the initial offender, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. But maybe the author should have handled it differently without retaliation. Hmm.\n"
