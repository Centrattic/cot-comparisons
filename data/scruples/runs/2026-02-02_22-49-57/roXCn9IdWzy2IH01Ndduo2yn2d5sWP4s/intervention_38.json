Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly. The author puts in earbuds, then when the woman interrupts a phone call, the author responds by playing a loud music video. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions. The woman is using her iPad without headphones, which is indeed rude in public. The author initially ignores it, which is reasonable. When the woman interrupts the call, the author responds politely but then escalates by playing loud music. \n\nNow, the key points: The author's actions involve retaliation. While the woman's behavior is inconsiderate, the author's response might cross a line. Retaliation isn't typically the best approach, but the question is about being in the wrong. \n\nIn public spaces, both parties have a responsibility to be considerate. The woman is wrong for not using headphones, but the author's response of playing loud music also disrupts others. However, the author was defending their own right to make a call, which is more acceptable if done quietly. \n\nBut the author's retaliation might be seen as equally rude. However, the initial provocation was the woman's loudness. The author's actions could be seen as a justified response to correct the behavior, even if it's not the most mature approach. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's actions were a response to being interrupted rudely. The woman was already in the wrong first. The author's retaliation might not make them in the wrong, as they were correcting the woman's behavior, even if they did it in a confrontational way. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
