Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author dealing with a woman who's being loud on an iPad in an airport. The author initially ignores it by using earbuds. Then, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call to ask for quiet, the author responds politely but then later plays a loud music video in response.\n\nFirst, the woman was being loud, which is generally considered rude in public. The author's initial reaction of using earbuds is reasonable. When the woman interrupts, the author does respond politely, pointing out the inconsistency. However, the key issue is the author's retaliation by playing loud music after agreeing that they were wrong. Even though the author initially made a point, the act of playing loud music full volume in a public space would be equally rude. The author's response was an escalation, which might not be justified despite the initial provocation. So, while the woman was at fault first, the author's action of playing loud music is also wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for retaliating in kind.\n"
