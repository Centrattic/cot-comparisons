Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The scenario is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author, the person telling the story, first tries to ignore it by putting in earbuds. Then, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call to ask to be quiet, the author responds by pointing out the woman's loudness. The woman claims she has a right to enjoy her show. The author then pretends to agree, takes off their earbuds, and plays a loud music video, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The woman was using her iPad without headphones, thus disturbing others. The author tried to avoid confrontation by using earbuds. When the woman interrupted the call, the author defended their action, pointing out the woman's own issue. Then, the author retaliated by playing loud music. \n\nIs the author's retaliation justified? Retaliating in kind with loudness might not be appropriate, even if the initial action was rude. The author could have escalated the conflict by mirroring the woman's behavior. However, the woman was also in the wrong for not using headphones. \n\nBut the key point is the author's response. While the woman was being inconsiderate, the author's decision to play loud music could be seen as equally inconsiderate. Public spaces require mutual consideration. The author's action might not be a justifiable response; instead, they could have addressed the issue more calmly without escalating. \n\nHowever, the author did point out the woman's mistake first. But the final act of playing loud music could be seen as a form of punishment, which might not be the right approach. So, while the woman was wrong to be loud, the author's retaliation might also be in the wrong. But maybe the author had a right to defend their actions, leading to a nuanced answer. However, since the user is expecting a binary choice, and the author's response was direct and proportional, but in public spaces, both sides should ideally use headphones. But since the woman didn't, the author's action could be seen as teaching a lesson, which might not be the best approach but not necessarily wrong. Alternatively, the author's action was a form of retaliation that's not appropriate. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether retaliating with loudness is acceptable. Since both parties were in public and should consider others, the author's action might be seen as equally rude. But the user might argue that the author was just giving the woman a taste of her own behavior, which could be justified. But legally and socially, both should avoid disturbing others. The author's action could be seen as in the wrong because they used loudness to respond, even if the initial action was wrong. However, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were addressing the woman's inconsiderate behavior. It's tricky. \n\nConsidering the options, maybe the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because they were responding to someone else's inconsiderate behavior, even though their response was loud. But in public places, both should avoid disturbing others. The author's action was a direct response, but maybe it's still wrong to retaliate. Hmm. I'm a bit split here. However, the initial problem was the woman's loudness, so the author's response was a form of direct confrontation, which might be seen as justified in some contexts. But in public etiquette, it's better to address such issues calmly. The author's action escalated the conflict. So maybe the answer is A (author in the wrong) because they retaliated with loudness, which is not appropriate even if they were provoked. However, if the user's perspective is that the woman was wrong first, then the author isn't in the wrong. But the key is whether the author's action is acceptable. Since both parties were violating the same rule, but the author's response was to mirror the behavior. In public, both should follow the rules. The author's action could be seen as a form of teaching a lesson, but it's not acceptable to break the same rule in response. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for playing loud music despite knowing that's inconsiderate. So answer A.\n"
