Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores her but then makes a phone call. The woman interrupts to ask him to talk quietly. The author responds politely, points out her loudness, and then plays a music video full volume on his own device, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is not wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, public spaces often have etiquette. People usually expect others to use headphones. The woman is violating that by watching without them. The author initially uses earbuds to avoid disturbance. When the woman interrupts, the author calmly explains her issue. Then, as a retort, the author plays loud music. \n\nIs that justified? Well, the author's actions escalate the situation. Even if the woman was wrong, responding with the same behavior might be seen as retaliating. While the author's initial point is valid, playing loud music could be considered equally rude. The author is using the same method to make a point, but it's passive-aggressive. The woman's reaction is understandable because now the author is being loud. \n\nSo, while the woman started the issue, the author's response might be seen as equally problematic. The author could have handled it better, maybe by calmly asking her to use headphones again or involving airport staff. Retaliation with loud music doesn't resolve the issue and could be seen as the author being in the wrong. So, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because even if the woman was at fault, the author's action was a similar disruption.\n"
