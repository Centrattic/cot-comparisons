Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing in the situation described. The scenario involves an older lady playing her show loudly on an iPad at the airport. The author initially uses earbuds to avoid the noise but then makes a phone call, which the lady interrupts. The author responds by pointing out her loudness and then retaliates by playing a music video loud on their own device, leading the lady to leave in anger.\n\nFirst, the lady was clearly being rude by using her iPad without headphones in a public space. The author's initial response was to put in their earbuds and ignore it, which is reasonable. When the lady interrupts the author's phone call, the author politely points out her behavior. So far, that's fair. \n\nBut then the author takes it a step further by playing a music video loudly on their own device. Even though the author apologized earlier, this action seems like revenge. While the lady was in the wrong, retaliating with the same behavior might not be the best approach. Public spaces require mutual respect, so playing loud after being told to be quiet could be seen as equally rude. However, the author's point about the lady's initial behavior being wrong is valid.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's retaliation crosses a line. The lady had no headphones, but the author had just been told to quiet down their phone call. By turning up their own device, the author is mirroring the rude behavior. Even if it's a form of teaching a lesson, it's still disruptive. So, while the lady was wrong first, the author's response might be seen as equally inconsiderate. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for escalating the situation with their own loud behavior after being asked to be quiet.\n"
