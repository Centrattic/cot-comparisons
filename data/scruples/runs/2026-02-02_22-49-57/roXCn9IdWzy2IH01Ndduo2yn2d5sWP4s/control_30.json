Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an older lady at the airport who's watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then the lady interrupts the author's phone call, asking them to talk quieter. The author responds by pointing out that the lady is being rude by not using headphones. The lady claims she has every right, and then the author plays a music video full volume on their iPad, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of both parties. The lady was watching her iPad loudly in a public area. That's generally considered impolite because it affects others. The author tried to be polite by putting in earbuds, which is a reasonable response. When the lady interrupts the author's call, the author defends themselves by pointing out the lady's behavior is also rude. The lady insists she has the right. Then the author retaliates by playing loud music, leading to the lady leaving in anger.\n\nNow, the key points are about public behavior and mutual respect. The lady's initial action is definitely inconsiderate, but the author's response might be crossing a line. While the author's point is valid\u2014public spaces require consideration\u2014their retaliation is equally inconsiderate. Instead of escalating the situation with loud music, the author could have continued ignoring the lady or perhaps spoken to her more calmly. By playing loud music, the author is mirror imaging the lady's behavior, which could be seen as vindictive or equally rude. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the lady was wrong to watch without headphones, but the author's response, while perhaps understandable, is also wrong because they chose to retaliate in an equally disruptive way. The author should have maintained their composure without escalating the conflict. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their action of playing loud music was a disproportionate and rude response, even if the lady was being inconsiderate first.\n"
