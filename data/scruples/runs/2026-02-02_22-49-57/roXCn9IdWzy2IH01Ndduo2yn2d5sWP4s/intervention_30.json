Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is at an airport. An older lady sits next to the author, watches a show on her iPad loudly. The author puts in earbuds to ignore it. Then the author makes a phone call, and the lady interrupts to ask them to talk quieter. The author responds by pointing out that she's being rude by not using headphones herself. The lady insists she's right, and the author then plays a music video full volume, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is wrong. The author's actions were a bit of a tit-for-tat. The lady was being disruptive, the author tried to reason but then escalated by playing loud music. Now, in public spaces, people are generally expected to use headphones or keep volume low. So the lady was wrong for not using headphones. But the author, after a polite response, decided to retaliate by playing loud music. Even though the author was being polite initially, the retaliation might be seen as crossing a line. \n\nThe key point here is about mutual respect and appropriate responses. The author had the right to ask for quietness, but responding with the same behavior could be seen as just as rude. Even if the author's initial point was valid, the method of response might be considered inappropriate. So while the lady was wrong for her initial behavior, the author might be in the wrong for not maintaining composure and instead escalating the situation with loud music. That could be seen as giving someone else a taste of their own medicine, which is a common phrase but not necessarily a socially acceptable response. So the answer might be A, yes, the author is in the wrong because they responded with the same rude behavior instead of de-escalating. But I need to consider if the author's actions were justified as a form of pointing out hypocrisy. However, in public, retaliating with loud noise is still disruptive. So probably A is the answer here.\n"
