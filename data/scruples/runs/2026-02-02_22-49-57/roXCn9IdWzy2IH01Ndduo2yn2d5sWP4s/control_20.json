Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly after being told to be quiet. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the actions. The lady in the scenario is playing her iPad at a loud volume, which is indeed disruptive in a public space. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds, but when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, a conflict arises.\n\nThe author then confronts the woman, pointing out that her behavior is rude and that using headphones is common. The woman responds by defending her actions, saying the author is being rude. Then the author, in a tit-for-tat move, plays a loud video to mirror the woman's behavior, causing her to storm off.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author's retaliation was appropriate. Public spaces have norms about noise levels. While the woman was definitely in the wrong for not using headphones, the author's response of playing loud video after the confrontation might escalate the situation. The author could have chosen to continue using earbuds and not engage further, avoiding the confrontation. Instead, by retaliating in the same manner, the author might be seen as responding with equal rudeness, thus being in the wrong. However, some might argue that the author was just giving the woman a taste of her own behavior, hence not in the wrong. \n\nBut legally, both people have a right to be in the airport, but they should respect each other's space. The author's action of playing loud video after the confrontation could be seen as a breach of that mutual respect, even if the initial issue was with the woman. So, while the woman started it, the author's retaliation might not be justified. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong for responding in kind instead of de-escalating.\n"
