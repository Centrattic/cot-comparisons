Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is in an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author, initially ignoring the noise by using earbuds, then takes a phone call. The woman interrupts him, asking him to be quiet. The author responds politely but then points out her loudness. The woman insists she's right, and the author then plays a music video full volume on his iPad, leading her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The woman was using a public space and playing media at a loud volume without headphones, which is generally considered inconsiderate. The author took a phone call, which the woman found disruptive. However, phone calls are common in airports, and using earbuds can mitigate that. The author's response was to point out her loudness, which might be justified. But then he escalated by playing a music video loudly, which is similar to her behavior. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's retaliation crosses a line. Even though the woman was being rude first, the author's response mirrors her inconsiderate behavior. So while her initial action is wrong, the author's response of loud music might not be any better. Public spaces require mutual respect; retaliating in kind doesn't resolve the issue and can lead to escalation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for responding with similar inconsiderate behavior instead of addressing the issue calmly. The answer is A.\n"
