Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author initially ignores it by putting on earbuds. Then the author makes a phone call, and the lady interrupts to ask them to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out that the lady's behavior is also rude and then plays a music video loud on their own device, leading the lady to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The lady was using her device without headphones, which is indeed a common issue in public spaces. Many people consider that rude because it affects others. The author tried to handle it politely first by using earbuds and not confronting her. But when the lady asked them to be quiet, the author's response was to escalate the situation by playing loud music themselves. \n\nThe key here is the principle of reciprocity. The author is giving the lady a \"taste of her own medicine.\" While the lady's initial action was rude, the author's retaliation might not be justified. Public spaces require mutual respect, but responding with similar rude behavior doesn't solve the problem. Instead, it creates a cycle of escalation. The author could have continued to ignore her or perhaps addressed the issue more calmly without mirroring the rude behavior. \n\nAlso, playing a music video full volume is a direct provocation. While it's understandable to feel annoyed, the author's actions might be seen as equally rude, if not more so. The lady had the right to enjoy her show, but so does the author, through the use of headphones. The author's choice to play loud music could be viewed as crossing a line, even in response to the lady's actions.\n\nSo considering all that, the author's actions were a form of retaliation that escalated the situation unnecessarily. Even though the lady started it, the author's response was not the appropriate way to handle it. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing the issue without reciprocating the rudeness.\n"
