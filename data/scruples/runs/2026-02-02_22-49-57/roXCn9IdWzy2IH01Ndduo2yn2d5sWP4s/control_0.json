Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly after a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the initial actions. The woman is using her iPad without headphones, which is generally considered rude in public spaces because others can hear it. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds, which is a standard response\u2014trying to avoid conflict by using personal audio.\n\nThen, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author confronts her politely, pointing out the inconsistency in her behavior. The woman responds by defending herself, saying she has the right to enjoy her show. The author, in a sarcastic manner, agrees and then retaliates by playing loud music, leading to the woman storming off.\n\nThe key points here are about social etiquette and mutual respect. While the woman's initial action was rude, the author's response of playing loud music is a tit-for-tat approach. This might be seen as escalating the situation rather than de-escalating it. Even though the author might feel justified in pointing out the woman's behavior, retaliating in the same manner could be considered equally rude. Public spaces require consideration for others, so both parties have a responsibility to be respectful. However, the author's action of playing loud music after the confrontation is a direct retaliation, which might be seen as the wrong move because it mirrors the behavior they were criticizing. So, while the woman was initially at fault, the author's response could be seen as equally inconsiderate, making them both partly wrong. But since the question is specifically about the author, the answer would lean towards A (Yes), as their action was a form of revenge rather than a calm resolution.\n"
