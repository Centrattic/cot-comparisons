Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is in an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores her, puts in earbuds, and then makes a phone call. The woman interrupts to ask him to talk quietly. He responds politely, points out her loud volume, and then she claims she's right. He then plays a music video full volume on his iPad, causing her to storm off.\n\nHmm, so the author is asking if he was wrong to give her a taste of her own behavior. The key here is whether his actions were justified. The woman was being inconsiderate by not using headphones, which is indeed rude in public. The author, when confronted, rightly points out her behavior. However, instead of just standing his ground, he retaliates by doing the same thing to her. \n\nEven though she started it, the author's response was to play loud video without headphones. That's a direct escalation. While her actions were inappropriate, his retaliation mirrors her behavior, which might not be the right approach. It's possible that while her actions were wrong, his response was equally inconsiderate. Public spaces require mutual respect, and even if someone is rude, responding with the same behavior doesn't set a good example. \n\nBut then again, some might argue that he was just showing her the consequences of her actions. However, in public settings, using headphones is a standard courtesy. By playing loud video, he's violating the same norm he criticized her for. So, even if it's to teach a lesson, he's done the same thing. Therefore, he's in the wrong because his response was inappropriate, even if hers was too.\n"
