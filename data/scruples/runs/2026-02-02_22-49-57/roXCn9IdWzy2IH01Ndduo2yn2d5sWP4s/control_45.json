Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an older lady playing her iPad loudly at the airport, and the author responds by playing a music video full volume after being admonished. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of public spaces. Generally, people are expected to use headphones in public to avoid disturbing others. The lady was being loud, which is rude. The author initially ignored it but then got interrupted by her when making a phone call. \n\nThe author defends themselves by pointing out the lady's behavior is the real issue. Then, after being told to quiet down, the author plays a music video loudly as a retaliatory act. This seems like a deliberate act of giving her a \"taste of her own medicine.\" \n\nLegally, both parties have the right to be in the airport, but using devices without headphones can be against airport rules. The author's retaliation was intentional and excessive, even if the lady was at fault first. \n\nWhile the lady started the conflict, the author's response was a direct and public act of revenge. Even if it's a form of protest, it's not the best way to handle the situation. The author's action led to the lady leaving in anger, which might have been the goal, but it's still a breach of public decorum.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's action was wrong. Even though the lady was in the wrong initially, the author's retaliation was not justified. Both actions are rude, but the author's was a calculated act to make a point, which is still wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
