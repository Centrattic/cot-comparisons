Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly after being told to quiet their phone call.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The woman is using her iPad without headphones, which is considered rude in public. The author initially ignores it by using earbuds, then makes a phone call. The woman interrupts to ask him to be quiet. He responds by pointing out her loud behavior and then retaliates by playing a music video loudly, causing her to leave in anger.\n\nSo, the key points are about public etiquette and mutual rudeness. Both parties are using devices without headphones, which is impolite. The author's response to the woman's complaint by playing loud music seems like an escalation. Even though the woman started it, the author's action of playing the video full volume is also rude. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. While the woman initiated the problem, the author's retaliation was equally rude. Public spaces require consideration for others, and both failed to use headphones. However, the author's action was a direct response, which might be seen as provoking the situation further. \n\nIn terms of social norms, both actions are inappropriate, but the author's response could be seen as crossing a line by intentionally being inconsiderate after being asked to be quiet. Even if the woman was wrong, the proper response would be to apologize and adjust, not retaliate. So the author might be at fault for escalating the conflict rather than resolving it.\n\nBut maybe the author is justified in pointing out the hypocrisy. However, the method of retaliation (playing loud music) is not appropriate. It's a matter of whether the means used to correct the behavior are acceptable. Since both actions are rude, but the author's was a direct reaction to being told to be quiet, it's a bit of a gray area. However, in public settings, using loud devices is a common issue, and the author's response might be seen as equally inconsiderate, making them at fault.\n"
