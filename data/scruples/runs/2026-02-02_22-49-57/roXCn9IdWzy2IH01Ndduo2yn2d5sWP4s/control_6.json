Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the right thing by retaliating against the woman who was being loud on her iPad.\n\nFirst, the woman sat next to the author and watched a show loudly. The author initially ignored it and used earbuds. Then, when the author made a phone call, the woman complained about the volume. The author responded by pointing out the woman's own loud behavior and then played a music video full volume, causing her to leave.\n\nSo, the key points here are about public etiquette and retaliation. The woman was being inconsiderate by not using headphones, which is a common expectation in public spaces. The author's initial response was to point out the hypocrisy, which makes sense because the woman was the one causing noise. However, the author then escalated the situation by playing loud music in response. \n\nWhile the woman was at fault for not using headphones, the author's retaliation might be seen as excessive. Instead of continuing the argument, maybe the author could have just ended the call and not engaged further. By playing loud music, the author mirrored the woman's inconsiderate behavior, which is hypocritical. Public spaces require mutual respect, and responding with the same level of disruption doesn't resolve the issue; it just creates a cycle of retaliation. \n\nEven though the woman was wrong first, the author's action of playing loud music full volume is also rude. The right approach would have been to address the issue politely and then not escalate it. So, while the woman was in the wrong initially, the author's action in the end also contributed to the conflict. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for retaliating in kind.\n"
