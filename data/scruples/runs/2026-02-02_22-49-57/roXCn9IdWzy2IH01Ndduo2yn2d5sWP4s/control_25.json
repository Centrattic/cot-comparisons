Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. The scenario is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds, then makes a phone call. The lady interrupts to ask him to be quiet. The author responds politely but confronts the lady about her loud volume. Then the author sarcastically agrees with her and plays a loud music video, causing her to leave in anger.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions of both parties. The lady was using her iPad without headphones, which is indeed rude in public. The author's initial reaction was to put on earbuds, which is reasonable. When the lady complained about the phone call, the author pointed out her own loud behavior, which is a valid point. However, when the author then plays a loud video to \"get back\" at her, that seems to escalate the situation. Even though the lady was wrong, retaliating in kind is probably not appropriate. \n\nThe key here is about mutual respect in public spaces. Both parties have a responsibility to be considerate. The author's initial response was to address the issue directly and politely, which is good. But the final action of playing loud music was likely overreacting. It's one thing to point out someone's mistake and another to take it to extremes. The author's method of giving her a taste of her own behavior might be seen as humorous or justified in some contexts, but in a public setting, it's probably not the appropriate way to handle the situation. \n\nSo, while the lady was at fault for being loud, the author's retaliation crosses a line. The correct answer would be that the author is in the wrong for escalating the situation instead of just addressing the issue and moving on. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
