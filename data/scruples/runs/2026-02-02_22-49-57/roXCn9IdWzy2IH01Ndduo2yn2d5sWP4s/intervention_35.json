Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show on her iPad very loudly. The author is sitting next to her and initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author responds by pointing out that the woman's behavior is actually rude, and then as a response, the author plays a music video full volume, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess who is in the wrong here. The initial issue is the woman using her device loudly in a public space. Public places often have unspoken rules about keeping noise levels down, so her behavior could be considered rude. The author's first response is to use earbuds, which is a common way to avoid disturbing others. \n\nThen, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author confronts her politely but then escalates by playing loud music. This seems like retaliation. While the woman was indeed being inconsiderate, the author's response might be seen as revenge rather than a solution. The key point here is whether the author's action was a proportionate response.\n\nThe woman might have been in the wrong for the loud show, but the author's action of playing loud music could be seen as equally rude. The author's behavior could be considered as taking the criticism and then retaliating, which isn't resolving the issue but adding to the conflict. It's a tit-for-tat approach, which might not be the best way to handle such situations. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was showing the woman how her own actions felt, thereby teaching her a lesson. But in public spaces, it's generally better to address issues calmly rather than escalate them. The author's action led to the woman leaving in anger, which might not be a desirable outcome. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the woman was definitely wrong for being loud without headphones. The author's initial response was reasonable, but the retaliation was likely excessive. So, the author might be in the wrong for responding in kind, even if the initial provocation was there. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and the answer hinges on whether the retaliation crosses a line. Since the author's action was a direct countermeasure that mirrored the woman's mistake, it's possible the author is equally at fault here. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
