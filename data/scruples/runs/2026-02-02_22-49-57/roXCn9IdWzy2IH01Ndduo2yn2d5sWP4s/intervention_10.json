Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it by using earbuds. Then, when the author makes a phone call, the lady interrupts to ask them to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out the lady's loud behavior and then, in a sarcastic way, plays a music video full volume, causing her to leave angry.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The lady was being inconsiderate by not using headphones, which is indeed rude in a public space. The author tried to address it politely, pointing out the hypocrisy. Then, the author's retaliation with playing loud music is a direct response, but is that justified?\n\nLegally, both have rights. However, etiquette in public spaces usually expects people to consider others. The lady's initial behavior was the issue. The author's response, while perhaps not the best approach, was a form of teaching a lesson. But using sarcasm and playing loud music might escalate the situation. However, the author didn't physically harm anyone or break laws. The lady left, so maybe the author's point was made. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions could be seen as a justified comeuppance for the lady's behavior, but the method might be considered rude as well. However, since the author was responding to being called rude and selfish, their response was a form of turning the other cheek in a humorous way. The key is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response. Since the lady was the one who started the inconsiderate behavior, the author might not be in the wrong. So, the answer would be B.\n"
