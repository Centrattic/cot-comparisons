Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly after being reprimanded.\n\nFirst, I need to break down what happened. The woman sat next to the author and used her iPad without headphones, which is clearly disruptive. The author initially tried to ignore it by putting in earbuds. Then, during a phone call, the woman complained about the call being loud. The author points out that the woman's own behavior is rude. The woman insists she's right, so the author retaliates by playing a loud video with her iPad. The woman then leaves angry.\n\nNow, the key points here are about public behavior and mutual rudeness. The woman's action of watching a show without headphones is indeed inconsiderate in a public space. The author's initial response was to use earbuds and then make a call, which is a common behavior. However, when reprimanded, the author's response escalates the situation by playing loud music. This seems like an act of retaliation rather than a solution. While the woman was wrong first, the author's action of playing loud music might be seen as equally rude, even if it's a form of \"giving a taste of their own medicine.\" \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, both might have the right to use their devices, but socially, both were being inconsiderate. However, the author's retaliation could be considered more aggressive because they escalated the conflict. Even if the woman started it, the author's response of playing loud music is also disruptive. So, even though the woman was wrong first, the author's action might not be justified and could be seen as equally inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for escalating the situation rather than de-escalating it.\n"
