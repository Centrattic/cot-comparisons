Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story was in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author uses earbuds, then makes a phone call. The woman interrupts the call, asking him to be quiet. The author responds that her loud show is actually rude and then plays a music video full volume on his own device after the woman leaves.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong. Let's break it down. Both parties were being loud in a public space. The woman was using her iPad without headphones, which is definitely rude because she's disturbing others. The author, when confronted, points out her behavior, which is reasonable because she's violating social norms. However, when she storms off, he plays his own loud video. \n\nNow, the key here is whether the author's retaliation was justified. The woman was in the wrong first by being loud. The author's initial response was to point out her mistake, which is fair. But then, after she leaves, he plays loud music as a form of revenge. That's where the potential issue lies. Even though she was wrong, responding with the same behavior (playing loud videos) might be seen as escalating the conflict. \n\nIn public spaces, it's generally expected to be considerate. Both parties violated this by making noise without headphones. The author's action of playing loud music after the woman left could be seen as a form of payback, which might not be the best approach. While the woman started it, the author's response could be considered equally rude. So, even if the woman was initially wrong, the author's retaliation is arguably not the right approach because it doesn't model good behavior and could be seen as petty. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for responding with the same kind of behavior, even if he felt justified. The correct approach would be to avoid retaliation and instead focus on maintaining the right behavior oneself, which in this case would be using headphones. So the answer might be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
