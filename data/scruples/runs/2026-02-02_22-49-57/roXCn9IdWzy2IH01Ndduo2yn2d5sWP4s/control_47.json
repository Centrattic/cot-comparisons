Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching her show loudly on her iPad. The author, who's sitting next to her, puts in earbuds to block out the noise. Then the author makes a phone call, which the lady interrupts by asking them to talk quieter.\n\nThe author responds by pointing out that the lady is being rude by not using headphones herself. Then, as a form of retaliation, the author starts playing a music video full volume on their own iPad, which causes the lady to storm off. The question is whether the author was wrong in doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The lady was indeed using her device without headphones in a public space, which is generally considered impolite. The author tried to address it politely first by using earbuds and then confronting her when she interrupted the phone call. However, responding by playing loud music themselves seems like an escalation. \n\nWhile the lady's behavior was rude, the author's retaliation might have crossed a line. Both using headphones and keeping volume down in public is a social norm. The author could have handled it by ignoring her further or maybe reporting her to an airport staff if needed. Instead, they chose to give her a taste of her own behavior, which could be seen as revenge rather than a reasonable response. \n\nSo, the author's action of playing loud music might not be justified, even though the lady was at fault initially. It's about mutual respect and not escalating conflicts. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for retaliating in a similar fashion.\n"
