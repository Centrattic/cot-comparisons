Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author was in the wrong for retaliating by playing a loud music video after a woman complained about his phone call. \n\nFirst, the older lady was watching her show loudly without headphones, which is indeed inconsiderate in a public place. The author tried to ignore it and even used earbuds to avoid the noise. When she complained about his phone call, he politely pointed out her own behavior. She then accused him of being rude and selfish.\n\nThe key part is his response. He sarcastically agreed with her, then played a loud video to mirror her actions. He's using her own tactics against her, which could be seen as giving her a taste of her own behavior. \n\nNow, is this justified? On one hand, she was clearly being inconsiderate, and the author tried to address it politely. On the other hand, escalating the situation by playing loud media is also inconsiderate and could be seen as revenge. Public spaces require mutual respect, and while the woman was wrong, retaliating in the same way might not be the best approach. \n\nHowever, the author's response was a direct reaction to her hypocrisy. He's pointing out her behavior by doing the same, which could be seen as a way to make her realize her mistake. But in terms of right and wrong, both actions (hers and his) are inconsiderate. The question is whether his action crosses the line. \n\nIn some contexts, this could be seen as a justified lesson, but legally and socially, both parties are being disruptive. The author might not be in the wrong because he's responding to her initial inconsiderate behavior, but his method of response is equally inconsiderate. So, depending on perspective, but the question is about being in the wrong. Since both actions are against social norms, the author might still be in the wrong for retaliating with the same behavior, even if provoked.\n"
