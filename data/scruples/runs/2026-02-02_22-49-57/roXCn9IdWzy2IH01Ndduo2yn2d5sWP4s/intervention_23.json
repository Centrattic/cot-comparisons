Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show on her iPad loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video full volume after being told to quiet their phone call. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The woman was using her iPad without headphones, which is generally considered rude in public spaces because others might be disturbed. The author initially tried to ignore it by using earbuds, which is a reasonable approach. Then, when the woman complained about the phone call, the author pointed out that the woman's volume was the issue. \n\nBut then the author took it a step further by playing a loud music video. Even though the author initially was in a right to be annoyed, retaliating in the same way could be seen as escalating the conflict. The woman had the right to complain about loud noises, and the author's response might be considered equally rude. \n\nSo, while the woman started the problem by not using headphones, the author's retaliation could also be seen as wrong because it's not productive and just causes more conflict. Public places require mutual respect, so even if someone is in the wrong, responding with the same behavior doesn't make it right. The author should have perhaps just apologized or turned down their phone call instead of retaliating. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for that reaction.\n"
