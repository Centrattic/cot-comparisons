Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The scenario is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly in return after a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The older lady was watching her show at a loud volume, which is generally considered inconsiderate in public spaces. The author initially tried to ignore it by using earbuds. Then, when the lady interrupted the author's phone call, the author responded politely but pointed out the lady's inconsiderate behavior. The author then escalated the situation by playing a music video at full volume, leading to the lady storming off.\n\nThe key points here are about public etiquette and mutual respect. The lady's actions were disruptive, and the author's initial response was reasonable. However, retaliating by playing loud music themselves is also inconsiderate. Even though the author was defending their own right to make a phone call, the response of playing loud music mirrors the lady's behavior, which could be seen as equally rude. The author's actions, while perhaps a form of tit-for-tat, don't resolve the issue politely and could be seen as escalating the conflict.\n\nSo, even though the lady started it, the author's retaliation might not be justified. Public spaces require mutual consideration, and responding with the same level of disruption doesn't set a good example. The author could have continued to use earbuds or left the area instead of retaliating. Therefore, the author's actions, while understandable in frustration, were also inconsiderate. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their retaliation was equally rude, even if the initial provocation was there.\n"
