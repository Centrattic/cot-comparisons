Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for retaliating against the loud woman in the airport. \n\nSo the situation: an older woman sits next to the author, plays her iPad loudly. The author initially ignores it, puts in earbuds. Then when the author makes a phone call, the woman interrupts to tell him to talk quietly. He responds by pointing out her loudness, and then to show her own behavior, he plays a video full volume on his iPad, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about public etiquette. In public spaces, people are generally expected to use headphones for audio to avoid disturbing others. The woman wasn't using headphones, which is rude. The author tried to address it politely by pointing out her loudness and suggesting headphones. But when she accused him of being rude, he escalated the situation by retaliating with his own loud audio.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Both parties had issues. The woman was being inconsiderate by not using headphones. The author tried to address it, but then took it too far by playing loud music in response. Retaliation isn't a good solution here. Even if the woman was wrong, the author's action of playing loud music full volume would be equally rude and potentially worse because it's a direct retaliation. Public spaces require mutual respect, but responding with the same inconsiderate behavior isn't justified. So while the woman was initially at fault, the author's actions crossed the line. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his retaliation was inappropriate and escalated the conflict instead of resolving it.\n"
