Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then the woman interrupts the author during a phone call, asking to be quieter. The author responds, pointing out the woman's loudness and the use of headphones. The woman claims her right to enjoy her show without interruptions. The author then plays a music video full volume on their own device, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nFirst, the woman was being rude by not using headphones, which is a common courtesy in public spaces. The author, as a passive observer, chose to use earbuds to avoid the noise. When the woman directly interrupted the author, the author had a right to respond, pointing out the hypocrisy. However, the author's response of playing loud music seems like a direct retaliation. While the author's initial point was valid, the action of playing music full volume might be seen as an overreaction. The author used the same behavior they criticized, which could be seen as unfair. Even if the woman was at fault, the author's public shaming via loud music might escalate the situation unnecessarily. The key here is whether tit-for-tat behavior is justified. In a public space, both should maintain civility. The author's action, while symbolic, could be seen as equally rude. So, the author might be in the wrong for not maintaining the same passive approach they initially used, instead of escalating with loud music. Therefore, answer A.\n"
