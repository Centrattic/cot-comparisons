Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The scenario is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it by using earbuds, but when the woman interrupts during a phone call, the author responds by playing a music video loudly as a form of retaliation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the initial situation. The woman is using a device in public without headphones, which is generally considered rude. The author, using earbuds, is actually doing the right thing by not disturbing others. When the woman interrupts the call, the author's response is to play loud music. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's retaliation crosses the line. The woman's action was impolite, but the author's response was to play loud music, which is similar to the woman's behavior. This seems like getting her back in kind. But in public spaces, both parties are expected to respect others. The woman's initial action was wrong, but the author's response could be seen as equally disruptive. \n\nHowever, the author's response was a direct consequence of the woman's rude behavior. The author might be trying to make a point about mutual respect. But playing music loudly in a public area is also disruptive. So even though the author was responding to the woman's rudeness, their action might still be considered wrong because it's not resolving the issue but escalating it. \n\nBut maybe in this context, the author is using irony to highlight the woman's mistake. The author's action is a form of teaching a lesson by showing the same behavior. But in a public setting, both actions are problematic. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The woman was wrong first, but the author's retaliation is also inappropriate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's action was a direct response to the woman's behavior, but still violates the same etiquette, the answer could be A (yes) because they shouldn't retaliate, or B (no) because they were correcting the woman's behavior. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to decide based on social norms. In public, both should avoid disturbing others. The author's retaliation might be justified as a lesson, but it's still disruptive. So maybe A is the answer. But I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check again. The author's response was to mirror the woman's behavior, which could be seen as teaching a lesson, but it's still rude. So the author is in the wrong because they didn't address the issue without escalating. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
