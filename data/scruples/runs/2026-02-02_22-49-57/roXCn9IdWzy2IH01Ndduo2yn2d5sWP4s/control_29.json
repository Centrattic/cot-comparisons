Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) in the situation is wrong for retaliating against a woman who was being loud on her iPad. \n\nFirst, the woman was watching a show loudly in a public airport. The author initially ignored it and used earbuds. Then, when the woman complained about the author's phone call, the author pointed out the woman's rude behavior. The woman defended herself, and the author then played a music video loudly in response, which made her storm off.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial conflict and the retaliation. Both parties are in a public space where noise can be an issue. The woman was using her device without headphones, which is generally considered rude. The author, when confronted, defended their actions and then escalated by playing loud music in response. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. The woman started by being disruptive, but the author's response was to retaliate in kind. While the author's initial reaction to point out the woman's behavior might be justified, the escalation by playing loud music is problematic. Retaliation with the same behavior doesn't resolve the issue and can be seen as equally rude. \n\nPublic spaces require consideration from everyone. While the woman was wrong for not using headphones, the author's response of playing loud music is also uncivil. Both actions are inappropriate, but the question is about the author's accountability. Since the author chose to escalate the situation rather than de-escalate, they might be considered at fault for their own actions. However, some might argue that the woman's initial behavior was the root cause. \n\nIn terms of social norms, using headphones is expected in public. The author's retaliation mirrors the woman's behavior, which isn't a good solution. So, the author's actions, while a reaction to the woman's, are still inconsiderate and wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their escalation was an inappropriate response.\n"
