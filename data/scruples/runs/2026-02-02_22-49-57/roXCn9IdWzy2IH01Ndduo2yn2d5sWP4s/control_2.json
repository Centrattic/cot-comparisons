Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this airport situation. So, the setup is that a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores it by using earbuds. Then the woman interrupts the author's phone call to ask him to talk quieter. The author responds by telling her that watching a show loudly is actually rude and then plays a music video full volume on his iPad, which causes her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who's at fault here. The key points are about public courtesy and mutual respect. The woman is being loud on her device without headphones, which is indeed a common issue in public spaces. The author's initial reaction is to politely point out the issue, which seems reasonable. However, when she interrupts his call, he escalates the situation by playing a loud video in response. \n\nThe main debate here is about proportional response. The woman's action is clearly impolite, but the author's retaliation might be seen as equally rude. Even if she was wrong first, responding by making noise yourself can be considered a form of revenge that's also disrespectful. Public places require everyone to be considerate, so while the woman was in the wrong initially, the author's reaction was also inappropriate because it mirrored her behavior. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because he took the situation into his own hands in a way that's not constructive. Instead of de-escalating, he escalated it. Even if her actions were rude, the best course is to address it politely without matching her behavior. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
