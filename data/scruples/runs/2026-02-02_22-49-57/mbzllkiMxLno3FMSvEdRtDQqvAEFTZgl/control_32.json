It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario involves Frank and Annie, where the author, who's close to Annie, suspects she's cheating because Frank is often away for work. The author suggests a paternity test during a visit, which leads Frank to get one, revealing the child isn't his. Now, Annie is without financial support and a home, and the author is being criticized by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's intention was to voice a suspicion they had, but they did it in a casual setting (after a few beers). The suggestion stuck, leading Frank to get a paternity test. The author didn't have concrete evidence but felt a \"feeling\" they couldn't shake. The result confirmed the infidelity, but the author is now being blamed for the fallout.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is in a tight spot. They care about Annie, but their action led to the breakdown of her marriage. However, the alternative is staying silent and letting Frank be deceived. The author might argue they were trying to protect Frank, even if their approach was questionable. On the other hand, they didn't have proof and possibly overstepped by making that comment, knowing it could influence Frank's decision.\n\nSocially, people might view the author as a meddler, especially since they're close to Annie. But if the author genuinely believed in their suspicion and tried to help Frank avoid a lifelong deception, even if their timing or method was flawed, it's debatable whether they're entirely at fault. The fact that Annie was emotionally cheating might mean she was the one primarily responsible for the infidelity, but the author's role in revealing it is being scrutinized.\n\nLegally, maybe the author isn't liable, but morally, the question is about right and wrong in social terms. The key here is that the author acted on suspicion without proof, possibly causing harm. However, the outcome was that Frank discovered the truth, which he might not have otherwise. So there's a balance between intent and consequence. The author's intention was protective, but the method was flawed. So depending on the perspective, they could be seen as in the right for trying to prevent harm or in the wrong for causing disruption without certainty.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they had a reason to suspect and tried to help, but they could have handled it more carefully. However, the question is a binary choice: A (Yes, in wrong) or B (No). Since the author's action led to the marriage breaking down despite their good intentions, some might argue they are in the wrong for meddling. Others might see it as a necessary action to uncover the truth. Given that the paternity test confirmed the infidelity, the author's concern was valid, but the way they approached it was perhaps inappropriate. However, the answer depends on whether the action itself was wrong regardless of outcome. If the action was crossing a boundary by making a suggestion that led to the test, then A. If the action was justified because it prevented a lifelong lie, then B. Given that the author didn't have evidence but acted on suspicion, and caused a public fallout, the answer might lean towards A. But it's a nuanced situation. Alternatively, if the author was trying to help Frank, maybe B. The question is tricky. But since the answer requires a binary choice, and considering the user's own stance (they think Annie created the situation), the answer might be B (No, not in the wrong) because the author's intent was to help Frank, and the truth came out, even though it caused pain. However, the author's method of suggesting the test in a casual setting might be seen as wrong. I'm a bit split. Maybe leaning towards B because the author's intent was to prevent Frank from being deceived, even if the method was flawed. Alternatively, maybe A if the author shouldn't have meddled without proof. Hmm. In the end, since the user is being criticized for ruining the marriage, but Annie was the one who cheated, the author's role is more a catalyst than the root cause. So, B (No) might be the better answer.\n"
