It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband (Frank) who was cheated on, and the author (the person asking) supported Frank when he found out. The author suggested a paternity test after a conversation that led to Frank getting one, which revealed the child wasn't his. Now, the author is being criticized by family for causing the marriage breakdown.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did something wrong. The key points here are: \n- The author knew something was off with Annie and Frank's marriage for years but didn't have proof. \n- The author, after drinking, suggested a paternity test, which Frank later acted on. \n- The test confirmed infidelity, leading to the marriage ending. \n- The author is now being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nThe question is whether the author's action (suggesting the test) was wrong. \n\nIn relationships, when there's suspicion of cheating, the people involved usually need to decide whether to address it. The author wasn't part of the marriage, so their role was to be a friend. However, the suggestion of a paternity test might have influenced Frank's decision. Even though the author's intention was to help Frank confirm his suspicions, the method of bringing it up (after drinking) could be seen as careless. But was it the author's fault that Frank acted on it? \n\nAlso, Annie was emotionally cheating and had a child with someone else, which is a major betrayal. The author is defending Frank's right to know, which is understandable. However, the author's friends and family are upset because they think the author shouldn't have intervened. But if the author didn't say anything, Frank might have remained in a deceptive marriage. \n\nThe moral dilemma here is whether the author had the right to bring up the paternity test suggestion. Since the author is a close friend and had been worried for a while, offering that advice might be seen as trying to help Frank protect himself. On the other hand, the author might not have the right to push Frank into a decision that could end his marriage. \n\nBut in the end, the truth came out, and Frank discovered the infidelity. Without the author's suggestion, maybe Frank wouldn't have considered the test. So the author's role was to support Frank in seeking the truth. Since Annie was the one who cheated, the main wrongdoer is her. The author's action, while perhaps intrusive, was in support of Frank. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
