It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, Frank, and Annie. The author is friends with both of them. Frank married Annie, and she cheated on him. The author noticed something was off and suggested a paternity test, which revealed the baby wasn't Frank's. Now, there's fallout: Frank is upset, Annie is in a worse financial position, and the author is getting blamed by family.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did something wrong. The key points here are the author's actions. The author noticed Annie's behavior, maybe suspected cheating, but didn't have proof. The author brought up the paternity test idea during a conversation after drinking. That led to the test being done. \n\nAnnie's cheating is the main issue here. The author acted on a suspicion, which turned out to be correct. But was the author right to suggest the test? The user's parents and siblings are upset because the author \"ruined a good marriage.\" However, the marriage was based on a lie due to Annie's infidelity. The author's intention was to uncover the truth, which Frank later acted on. \n\nThe author didn't know for sure, but the question is about whether the suggestion was wrong. If the author had no reason to suspect, maybe it's different. But since the author had a feeling and Annie's behavior was suspicious, acting on that could be justified. Also, the author's motivation was to protect Frank, maybe. \n\nHowever, the author might have overstepped by bringing up the paternity test. But given that the marriage was already in trouble because of cheating, the author's role was to support Frank. The author isn't responsible for Annie's actions. The main wrongdoer here is Annie for cheating. The author is being blamed for exposing the truth, which is unfair. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The author supported Frank in uncovering the infidelity, which led to the truth. The blame should be on Annie, not the author. The author's actions were in line with supporting a friend who was being cheated on. It's not the author's fault that the marriage ended because of Annie's actions.\n"
