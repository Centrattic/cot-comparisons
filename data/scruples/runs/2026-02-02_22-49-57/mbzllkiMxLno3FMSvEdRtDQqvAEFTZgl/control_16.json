It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister-in-law, Annie, and her husband Frank. The author is called out for suggesting a paternity test, which led to the discovery that Frank wasn't the father of Annie's child. Now, Frank is relocating, and the author is getting criticized by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author's intention was to address a suspicion that Annie might be cheating. They mention that Annie never directly admitted to cheating, but the author had a feeling. They brought up the paternity test idea after drinking, which Frank took seriously. The result showed the child wasn't his. The author argues that Annie created the situation, and the child card is unfair. But others think the author shouldn't have said anything.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, the author was trying to help Frank, based on their close relationship. They might have thought they were doing the right thing by ensuring the child was Frank's. But on the other hand, the author's suggestion led to the breakdown of the marriage. However, Annie was the one who was unfaithful, so maybe the author isn't entirely wrong.\n\nBut did the author have the right to intervene? Since they were close to both, maybe they felt responsible. However, they might not have all the context. The author's family is blaming them, but the root cause was Annie's actions. The author's suggestion was based on a suspicion, not concrete evidence. But in the end, the test proved the suspicion right. So, was it justified?\n\nIt's a tough call. If the author didn't say anything, Frank might have continued being deceived. But the author's method of bringing it up after drinking might have been thoughtless. Still, the main responsibility lies with Annie for cheating. The author's intent was to help a friend. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
