It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is close friends with Annie, who married Frank. Frank is in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. Over three years, Annie never directly admitted to cheating, but the author sensed something. Then, when they find out Annie's pregnant, the author, after some drinks, suggests a paternity test. Frank acts on that advice, gets a test done, and finds out he's not the biological father. The author is blamed by Frank's family for causing the breakdown of the marriage, and now both the author and Frank are isolated from their families and friends.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author had a suspicion, maybe based on feeling rather than facts, and made a suggestion that led to the paternity test. But was that justified? Let's think. Cheating is a serious issue. If Annie was emotionally cheating and had a child with someone else, that's a betrayal. The author's suggestion might have uncovered the truth, which Frank needed to know. But the author didn't have proof, just a feeling. However, in some cases, people do act on suspicions when it's about their own child's paternity. \n\nThe author's intention might have been to help Frank. If the child isn't his, that's a big deal for Frank. On the other hand, the author might have overstepped by pushing for a test without being 100% sure. But given that Frank later used the suggestion, maybe the author didn't force him to do it. Frank made the choice himself. \n\nNow, the author is being blamed by Frank's family for causing the breakup. But Annie was the one who was unfaithful. The author's role was just the catalyst for Frank to discover the truth. The real responsibility lies with Annie for her actions. The author might have been right to voice a concern, especially if they trusted their judgment. However, the way the author approached it (after a few beers) could be seen as inconsiderate. But maybe it was a necessary step.\n\nAnother angle: The author is being accused of ruining a marriage, but the marriage was already troubled due to Annie's infidelity. The author's intervention led to the truth coming out, which might have been inevitable. So, maybe the author isn't at fault here. The blame on the author seems misplaced, as the real issue is Annie's cheating.\n\nAlso, the family's reaction to the author suggests they don't want to confront the reality of the cheating, so they're blaming the messenger. The author did the right thing by supporting Frank's decision to get a test, leading to the truth. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
