It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend's sister, Annie, who was married to Frank. The author, let's call them the narrator, has known Annie since they were babies and considers her a sister. Frank works in the oil industry with a schedule of 14 days on and off. For three years, Annie didn't explicitly say she was cheating, but the narrator had a feeling. Then when they found out Annie was pregnant, the narrator, during a drunk conversation, suggested a paternity test. Frank later insisted on getting one, and the baby wasn't his. The situation blew up, leading to Frank and Annie's breakup. Now Annie is without Frank's income and home, moving back with her parents. The narrator is getting criticized by family for not keeping quiet and for ruining the marriage. The narrator defends themselves by saying Annie created the situation and thinks using the child as an excuse is unfair. Both the narrator and Frank are isolated and Frank is moving away.\n\nSo the question is, is the narrator at fault? Let's break it down. First, the narrator's role was to suggest the paternity test. The key points here are whether the suggestion was justified and if the narrator had a right to intervene. The narrator had a suspicion that Annie was cheating, but without concrete evidence. By suggesting the test, the narrator might have acted on a feeling, which led to the test confirming the suspicion. But the problem is, did the narrator overstep? Since they were close friends, maybe they thought they were helping Frank. However, the suggestion came from the narrator, which Frank later used to get the test. But was it the narrator's place to push for a paternity test?\n\nAnother angle is that Annie was emotionally cheating, which Frank later found out. If Annie was the one being unfaithful, then the narrator's suggestion might have been a way to protect Frank. But the issue is that the narrator is being blamed for breaking up the marriage. However, the marriage was already in trouble because of Annie's infidelity. The narrator's action exposed the truth, leading to the breakup. But maybe the narrator shouldn't have pushed for the test without Frank being certain. The narrator was drunk when they made the suggestion, which might have lessened their responsibility, but they still voiced it.\n\nOn the other hand, Frank decided to take the suggestion seriously and insisted on the test. So while the narrator's comment was the catalyst, Frank made the decision. The narrator's intention was to help, but the consequences were severe. The narrator is now ostracized for \"ruining\" the marriage. But if Annie was cheating, maybe the marriage was doomed anyway. The narrator's action revealed the truth, which is necessary, but perhaps the timing and method were inappropriate.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if you suspect someone is cheating, is it your duty to confront the spouse? Or is it meddling? The narrator is a close friend, so maybe they felt responsible. But they might not have the right to interfere. Also, the paternity test result means the child isn't Frank's, which adds to the emotional turmoil. The narrator is defending their position by saying Annie was the one who created the situation. So the answer might hinge on whether the narrator's action was justified given their concern, or if they overstepped by suggesting a test based on a hunch. Given the lack of direct evidence and the consequences, the narrator might be seen as at fault for not keeping their mouth shut. However, if the marriage was built on a lie, maybe the truth needed to come out regardless. It's a tough call, but the fact that the narrator's suggestion led directly to the test and subsequent fallout might make them responsible in the eyes of others, even if the root cause was Annie's infidelity.\n"
