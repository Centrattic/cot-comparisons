It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person who supported their sister-in-law's husband after he found out he wasn't the biological father. The author suggested a paternity test, which led to the husband discovering the infidelity. Now the author is being criticized by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's sister, Annie, was married to Frank. Frank was away a lot due to his job, and the author sensed something was off but couldn't do much from afar. When the pregnancy happened, the author jokingly suggested a paternity test after some drinks. Frank took it seriously, got the test, and found out he wasn't the father. The author's family is upset, calling the author to blame for the marriage breakdown.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. Let me consider the possible angles. On one hand, the author had suspicions but didn't have proof. By suggesting the test, they might have caused harm if the husband didn't act on it. On the other hand, if the wife was indeed cheating, the author's action might have been necessary for the husband to know the truth.\n\nBut there's a nuance. The author's comment was made in a casual setting (after a few beers). Was it an honest concern, or was it a joke? If the author genuinely believed there was infidelity, maybe they had a responsibility to mention it. But if they were just speculating without evidence, it could be meddling.\n\nAlso, the husband did take the comment seriously and acted on it, leading to the confrontation. The wife then lost financial support and a home, which complicates things. The author is being blamed for the fallout. However, the wife was the one who was unfaithful, so the author's role might be secondary.\n\nAnother point: the author's family is criticizing them for causing the disruption. But the author's intention was to support Frank, not to meddle. The author's sister was emotionally cheating, so maybe the author felt the need to help Frank uncover the truth. The author's actions led to the truth coming out, which could be seen as right, even if it caused immediate pain.\n\nBut wait, is the author overstepping by suggesting a paternity test? It's a personal matter, and the husband should be the one to handle it. The author's role might have been to express concern, but not to push for a test. However, in this case, the husband took the initiative, so the author's suggestion might have been a catalyst.\n\nAlso, the author is now isolated from family for standing by Frank. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is intent. If the author's intent was to help Frank get the truth, they might not be wrong. But if they were meddling without evidence, they could be at fault.\n\nIn conclusion, the author had a suspicion based on their relationship with Annie and Frank. They made a suggestion that led to the truth being revealed. While the method might be questionable, the intention was to support Frank. So, the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
