It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where the author is a close friend of Annie. The author suggested a paternity test, which led to Frank finding out Annie cheated. Now, the author is being criticized by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author knew Annie and Frank were married, but Annie had a side relationship. The author, living far away, noticed something off but couldn't do much. When the baby was coming, the author asked Frank about a paternity test after drinking. Frank took the suggestion seriously, did the test, and found out the kid wasn't his. The author's family is blaming them for the fallout, saying they shouldn't have said anything. The author defends their stance by saying Annie created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nSo, the main question is: Should the author have kept their mouth shut? From an ethical standpoint, if you suspect someone is cheating, is it your responsibility to intervene? The author's intention might have been to help Frank confirm his suspicions, but by suggesting the paternity test, they might have acted without full knowledge. However, they didn't have proof, just a feeling. \n\nAnnie's side: If she was emotionally cheating and had a child with someone else, that's a betrayal. The author might have felt compelled to act to protect Frank, even if it was a suspicion. But was it their place to push for a paternity test? Maybe they overstepped, especially since they weren't directly involved in the marriage. The author's family is upset because they think the author meddled where they shouldn't have. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author didn't say anything, Frank might have continued in a lying marriage, not knowing the truth. The author's action led to the truth coming out, which could be seen as the right thing to do. But the method might be questionable. \n\nThe author might argue that they were trying to prevent a bigger lie, like Frank raising a child that's not his. That's a significant issue. However, the author didn't have proof, just a suspicion. Maybe they should have advised Frank to confront Annie directly without pushing for a test, or maybe they should have stayed out of it. \n\nIt's a tough call. If the author truly believed in their friend's betrayal, they might feel justified. But the consequences are severe for both Frank and Annie. The author's role as a friend of Annie complicates things. They might have been biased, or maybe they were just trying to help a friend (Frank) they care about. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author isn't maliciously causing harm but acting on a suspicion. However, without evidence, suggesting a paternity test could be seen as crossing a line. But the alternative is inaction, which might let a wrong continue. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because their intention was to uncover the truth, but they might have handled it in a way that was intrusive. The answer might lean towards \"Not in the wrong,\" so B.\n"
