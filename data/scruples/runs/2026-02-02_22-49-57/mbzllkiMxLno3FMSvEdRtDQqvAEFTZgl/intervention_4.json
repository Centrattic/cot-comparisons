It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband. The story is about Frank and Annie. The author is close to both, and they've known each other since childhood. Annie was married to Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on and off schedule. Over three years, Annie was having an affair, and the baby isn't Frank's. The author suggested a paternity test when visiting, which led to Frank getting the test. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, moving back with her parents. The author is being criticized by family for ruining the marriage and using the child as an excuse. The author thinks Annie is at fault and that it's unfair to use the child as a reason.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. The task is to decide A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the author's role in suggesting the paternity test, whether they had the right to do so, and whether the consequences make them at fault. \n\nThe author noticed something off but couldn't act from far away. When visiting, they brought up the paternity test after some drinks. Frank later acted on it. The author's suggestion led to the test, which exposed the infidelity. Annie's actions caused the marriage breakdown. The author's family is blaming them, but the author believes Annie is the one who created the situation. \n\nIs the author responsible for Frank's decision? The author made a suggestion, but Frank made the choice to pursue the test. The author didn't push him to do it; they just planted the idea. However, suggesting a paternity test in a social setting, even if from concern, might be seen as overstepping, especially if the author wasn't directly involved in their marriage. But if the author had a close relationship with both, maybe they felt justified. \n\nThe author's criticism is that Annie's actions led to the situation, and using the child as an excuse is unfair. From a moral standpoint, the author's intent was to help Frank discover the truth, which he eventually did. The author didn't force Frank's hand, so they might not be at fault. The blame on the author from family is misplaced, as the real issue is Annie's infidelity. \n\nHowever, could the author have handled it differently? Maybe approaching Frank privately instead of jokingly after drinking. But the outcome was that Frank confronted the issue. Without the author's suggestion, Frank might not have considered the test. Still, responsibility for the marriage's dissolution lies with Annie. The author's role is a catalyst but not the root cause. \n\nIn terms of wrongdoing, the author acted on a suspicion and gave a suggestion. If the suggestion led to a positive outcome (Frank knowing the truth), even if it caused pain, the author isn't in the wrong. The family's judgment is unfair because they don't see the underlying issues. The author's support for Frank is justified given Annie's betrayal. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
