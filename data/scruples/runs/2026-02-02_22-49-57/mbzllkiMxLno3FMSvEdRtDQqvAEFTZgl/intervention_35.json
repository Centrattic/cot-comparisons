It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's close friends with Annie, suggested a paternity test to Frank. That led to Frank finding out Annie was cheating, the baby isn't his, and now their family is in disarray. The author is being criticized for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts as presented. The author didn't know for sure that Annie was cheating, just had a feeling. They were in a place to suggest the test after drinking, which might not have been the best time. The key here is intent. The author's intention was probably to help Frank by addressing the possibility of infidelity, but the outcome was disastrous.\n\nBut wait, how did the author know to even suggest the test? They mentioned that Annie had been with Frank for three years, and the author had a feeling something was off. Since the author was close to both, maybe they had some indirect information or noticed behaviors. The problem is that the author made an assumption that led to Frank taking action, which he might not have done otherwise. \n\nNow, is the author responsible? If the author didn't have concrete evidence, just a suspicion, and their suggestion caused Frank to act on it, that could be seen as overstepping. Friends sometimes give advice, but in this case, it's a very sensitive issue. Cheating and paternity are huge matters. The author's role as a close friend might mean they thought they were helping, but maybe they shouldn't have pushed for a test without more proof. \n\nAlso, the author's family is criticizing them, saying they should have kept their mouth shut. Is that fair? If the author acted out of concern, maybe their intentions were good, but the result was harmful. However, the fact that Annie was cheating and the child isn't Frank's might mean that the marriage was already doomed. The author's action just exposed the truth, which could be seen as the right thing to do, even if it caused pain.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author had no malicious intent and was trying to protect Frank from a lie, maybe they're not wrong. But if they acted recklessly without enough evidence, they might share some blame. The line between helping and interfering is blurry here. Since the story is from the author's perspective and they mention that Annie never directly admitted to cheating, the author's suggestion might have been based on a hunch. \n\nIn ethical terms, sometimes truth-telling is a moral duty, even if it's painful. However, the method of bringing up such a sensitive issue after drinking and without clear evidence could be problematic. The author might have overstepped their role as a friend by pushing Frank to take a drastic step. \n\nBut considering that Annie was cheating, maybe the author did the right thing by encouraging the test. The problem is the method and the lack of certainty. It's hard to say. Different people might have different views. Some might say the author was right to act on their suspicion to prevent Frank from being a father to someone else's child. Others might think they shouldn't have meddled without proof. \n\nGiven the information, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they had the intention to help, but they might have handled it poorly. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong at all. Since the outcome was negative, but the root cause was Annie's infidelity, the author's role might be considered as having done the right thing, though the way they did it was questionable. But the final answer depends on whether intent or outcome is more important. If the author's action led directly to the breakup, maybe they are partially responsible. Still, if the marriage was already failing due to Annie's actions, the author's suggestion might have just revealed the truth. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the core issue was Annie's cheating, and the author's action, while perhaps poorly executed, was to uncover the truth, which is a valid concern.\n"
