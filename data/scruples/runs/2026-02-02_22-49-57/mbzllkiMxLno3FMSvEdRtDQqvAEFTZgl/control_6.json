It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where Annie cheated emotionally and had a child with someone else. The author, who is close to Annie, suggested a paternity test to Frank, which led to the discovery and the breakdown of the marriage.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The author noticed something off but wasn't directly told about the infidelity. They suggested a paternity test, which Frank took seriously, leading to the child not being his. Now, the author is facing backlash from their family for \"ruining\" the marriage. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, suggesting a paternity test might be seen as a way to uncover the truth, especially if there were suspicions. However, the author's role here is a bit complex. They weren't in a position to know for sure, just had a feeling. By bringing it up, they might have acted on a suspicion without concrete evidence. But on the other hand, if the husband was being deceived, maybe the author's intention was to help him discover the truth.\n\nBut wait, the author's relationship with Annie is close, so maybe they were biased towards her? The story says Annie had a child with someone else while married, which is definitely wrong. The author's action, while maybe well-intentioned, led to consequences. However, the fault here is more on Annie for cheating. The author might have overstepped by suggesting the test, but without knowing for sure, maybe it's a gray area.\n\nAlso, the author's family is blaming them, but the main wrongdoer is Annie. The author's intention was to help Frank confirm paternity, which is a valid concern. Even if the suggestion was made in a casual setting (after beers), the outcome was necessary for Frank to know the truth. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, maybe they shouldn't have brought it up without more certainty. But given that Frank later took the suggestion seriously and got a test, perhaps it's justified.\n\nIn conclusion, the main wrongdoing was Annie's cheating. The author's role was to point out a possible issue, which led to the truth coming out. While the author's action had consequences, the primary fault lies with Annie. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
