It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about Frank and Annie's marriage. The author is a close friend to Annie, almost like a sister. Frank was cheating, or at least Annie was cheating on him. The author found out that the baby isn't Frank's and suggested a paternity test after a few beers. That led to Frank finding out, and now Annie is struggling without his income and home, and the author is getting blamed by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author suspected infidelity but couldn't do much from 1000 km away. Then, when visiting, after some drinks, the author mentioned the paternity test. Frank later insisted on getting one, which revealed the baby wasn't his. The author's suggestion was a trigger, but the real issue is Annie's infidelity. \n\nThe author's family is saying they should've kept quiet. But the author believes Annie was the one who created the situation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for bringing up the paternity test idea. \n\nIn relationships, infidelity is a major issue. If Annie was emotionally cheating and the baby isn't Frank's, that's a betrayal. The author, as a close friend, might have noticed something off and wanted to help Frank. But the timing and the way it was brought up could matter. The author was drunk, which might have been a mistake. However, the suggestion itself was a valid concern, especially if there were signs of infidelity. \n\nThe author isn't responsible for Annie's actions. The problem started with Annie's cheating, not the author's comment. The author was trying to help Frank by suggesting a test, which eventually uncovered the truth. Even though it led to the breakup, the author isn't to blame for Annie's choices. The family's criticism seems misplaced because the main issue was the cheating, not the author's suggestion. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
