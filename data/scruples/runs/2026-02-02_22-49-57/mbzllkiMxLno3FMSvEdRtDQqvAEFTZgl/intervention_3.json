It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where Annie was cheating, and the author suggested a paternity test after getting drunk. The test revealed the child wasn't Frank's, leading to a fallout where the author is now being criticized by family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't directly accuse Annie but had a feeling she was seeing someone. Then, during a visit, the author jokingly suggested a paternity test after drinking. Frank took it seriously and got the test, which confirmed the infidelity. The author is now being blamed for ruining the marriage.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the cheating is clearly on Annie's side. The author's intention wasn't malicious; they were trying to help Frank be sure. However, the method was a bit hasty\u2014suggesting a test after drinking might not have been the best approach. But the author didn't have concrete evidence, just a suspicion. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault. Since the author didn't know for sure and was acting on a hunch, it's more about Frank's choice to act on that suggestion. The author's role was to voice a concern, even if it was in a less-than-ideal situation. The real wrongdoing is Annie's infidelity. The author isn't responsible for the outcome because they didn't have definitive proof and were trying to help. The family's criticism seems misplaced since the fault lies with Annie. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
