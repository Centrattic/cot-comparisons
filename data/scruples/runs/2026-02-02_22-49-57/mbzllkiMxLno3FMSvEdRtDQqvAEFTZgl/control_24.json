It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage where Annie cheated, leading to Frank finding out the baby isn't his. The author, who's close to Annie, suggested a paternity test, which led to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The author mentions that Annie and Frank had been married three years. Frank was away a lot due to his job. The author suspected infidelity but couldn't be sure. When Frank found out about the affair (emotional cheating), the author's suggestion of a paternity test was used as a catalyst. Now, the author is being criticized for speaking up and causing the marriage to fall apart.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's role in suggesting the paternity test, whether Annie was actually cheating, and the consequences. The author argues that Annie created the situation by cheating, and it's unfair to blame them. Others think they should've stayed silent.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't have concrete evidence. They just had a feeling. Maybe they were overstepping by bringing it up. Even if they were concerned, confronting Frank about paternity without knowing for sure could be seen as interfering. Also, the author might have thought they were helping Frank by pointing out the possibility, but it ended up causing more harm. \n\nOn the other hand, if Annie was indeed cheating and the baby isn't Frank's, then maybe the test was necessary for Frank to know the truth. But the author didn't have proof, just suspicion. So their suggestion might have been based on a hunch. It could be that the author acted impulsively after a few beers, which might not be the best judgment.\n\nThe aftermath is that both the author and Frank are isolated from their families, which adds emotional weight. The author is defending their actions by saying Annie was the one who caused the situation. However, bringing up the suspicion led directly to the test and the subsequent breakup. So even if Annie was at fault, the author's action was the immediate cause. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the question is about responsibility for the situation. Even if the underlying issue (cheating) is Annie's fault, the author's role in exposing it could be seen as contributing to the breakdown. The author didn't have proof, but their comment led to the test. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not handling it more carefully or for not letting Frank deal with it on his own. \n\nAlso, the author's friends and family are blaming them, which is common in such situations. The author might have thought they were helping, but causing the marriage to end could be seen as overstepping. The line between helping and interfering can be blurry here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they acted on a suspicion without evidence, leading to the marriage's collapse. Even if Annie was guilty, the author's actions were the direct cause, which could mean they share some responsibility. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
