It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage. The author is a close friend of Annie, acting like a sister. Frank was away a lot for work, and the author suspected Annie was cheating. When Frank found out the child wasn't his, he divorced Annie. The author's comment about a paternity test led to this discovery, and now the author is getting blamed for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to help Frank verify the paternity. They didn't know Annie was cheating directly, just had a feeling. But suggesting a paternity test led to the truth. Now the author is supporting Frank, who's been wronged. The friends and family think the author should have stayed silent. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. They were concerned and maybe right to suggest the test. But did they have the right to interfere? Frank might have needed to discover the cheating on his own. However, Annie's actions were clearly the problem. The author's suggestion led to the truth, which exposed the infidelity. The author isn't responsible for Annie's actions. Frank had the right to know if the child wasn't his. The author was trying to help Frank. Even if the suggestion caused the divorce, Annie was the one who cheated. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
