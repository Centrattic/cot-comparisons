It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend, Annie, who cheated on her husband Frank. The author, who's close to both, suggested a paternity test after feeling something was off. The test proved Frank wasn't the father, leading to the breakup and Annie being left without Frank's income and home. The author is getting criticized by family for causing the marriage to end.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author didn't know for sure Annie was cheating, just had a feeling. They were far away, so couldn't intervene much. The author's suggestion led to the paternity test, which Frank took seriously. Now the author is blamed for ruining the marriage.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, the author acted on a suspicion without concrete proof. But they weren't the one cheating; Annie was. The author's intention was likely to help Frank ensure the child was his. However, the method of bringing it up after drinking might have been careless. But does that make the author wrong?\n\nAlso, the author's family is criticizing them for speaking up. They argue that Annie's actions created the situation. The author's stance is that Annie created the problem, not them. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the wrongdoer here is Annie for cheating. The author tried to help Frank, even if the approach could have been better. So, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the possibility, even if it caused the marriage to end. The real issue is the infidelity. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
