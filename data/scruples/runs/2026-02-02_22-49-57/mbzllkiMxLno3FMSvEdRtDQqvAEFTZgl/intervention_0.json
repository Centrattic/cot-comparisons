It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (who is \"me\" in the story) is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, after suggesting a paternity test that led to the discovery of the affair.\n\nFirst, the situation: Frank and Annie have a 3-year marriage. Frank is a workaholic with a demanding job, spending 14 days on and 14 off. Annie never directly confessed to infidelity, but the author sensed something. When they find out Annie's pregnant, the author, after drinking, suggests a paternity test. Frank takes the suggestion seriously, gets a test, and it turns out the baby isn't his. The author is blamed for ruining the marriage, and now Frank is moving away, isolated.\n\nThe author's parents and siblings are upset, saying the author shouldn't have said anything. The author feels Annie is at fault, and they're sticking by Frank. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nSo, considering the facts: The author had a suspicion but no evidence. They made a comment in a casual setting (after drinking) which led to Frank taking action. The key points here are intent and responsibility. Did the author have a right to question Annie's fidelity? Since there was no direct accusation, just a feeling, the author's comment might be seen as meddling. However, the author's role as a close friend (like a sister) might give them some standing to voice concerns, especially if they felt the situation was wrong.\n\nBut then, suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence could be seen as overstepping. It's possible the author didn't realize the impact of their words. However, the fact that Frank followed through on the suggestion shows he had his own suspicions. The author's intention was to help ensure Frank's child was his, which is a valid concern in a marriage. However, the method of bringing it up (after drinking) might have been unwise. Still, the author isn't the one who committed the infidelity. The real responsibility lies with Annie for her actions. The author's suggestion, while potentially intrusive, was aimed at uncovering the truth.\n\nThe family is blaming the author, but the actual wrongdoing is Annie's. The author might have acted on a hunch, but it led to revealing the truth. Arguably, the author isn't in the wrong because they weren't the one who cheated. However, maybe they crossed a line by not being more discreet or by not having evidence. But in the absence of clear proof, sometimes friends do voice concerns. It's a gray area. On one hand, they helped Frank uncover the truth; on the other, their comment initiated the conflict. But considering the outcome, the main at-fault person is Annie. Therefore, the author isn't entirely to blame.\n"
