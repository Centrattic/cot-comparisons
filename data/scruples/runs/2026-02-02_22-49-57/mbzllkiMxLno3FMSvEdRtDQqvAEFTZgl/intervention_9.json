It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where the author (let's call them \"Narrator\") is a close friend of both. The main issue is that the Narrator suggested a paternity test, which led to Frank discovering Annie was emotionally unfaithful and the baby wasn't his.\n\nFirst, the Narrator had a long-standing relationship with both Frank and Annie. They noticed something off for years but couldn't act on it due to distance. When they visited and asked Frank about a paternity test after drinking, it's a sensitive topic. Frank later took the suggestion seriously, which led to the breakup and Annie's current situation.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The Narrator's intention was likely to prevent a potential disaster for Frank. If the baby wasn't his, Frank might have been raising a child that isn't his biologically. The Narrator might have felt that their intuition about Annie's infidelity was right, so they wanted to confirm it. However, bringing up the paternity test in a semi-drunk state might not have been the best approach. But the key point is whether the suggestion was a breach of trust or not.\n\nAnnie is the one who was unfaithful, so she's at fault for the cheating. The Narrator's role was to support Frank, which they did. Even though the way they approached the test might have been awkward, the underlying concern was valid. The Narrator isn't the one who cheated; they tried to help their friend avoid being wronged.\n\nThe friends and family are blaming the Narrator for ruining the marriage, but the real issue is Annie's actions. The Narrator's suggestion led to the truth coming out, which, while painful, is necessary for Frank to make informed decisions. The child being used as a reason to criticize the Narrator is unfair because the child's well-being is now affected by the cheating, not the suggestion of a test.\n\nIsolation from friends and family is a result of the fallout, but the Narrator isn't the one who caused the infidelity. They tried to support Frank, which is the right thing to do. Even if the method of bringing up the test was questionable, the intent wasn't malicious. So, the answer here is B; the Narrator isn't in the wrong.\n"
