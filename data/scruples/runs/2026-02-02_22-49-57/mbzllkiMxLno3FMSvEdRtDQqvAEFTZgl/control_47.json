It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the main points from the story: The author is close friends with Annie, who married Frank. Frank works in a job that keeps him away for two weeks at a time. Over three years, Annie never explicitly admitted to cheating but the author had suspicions. Then, when Annie and Frank announced a pregnancy, the author, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank took that suggestion seriously and got the test, which revealed the child isn't his. The author's suggestion led to the breakup, and now the author is being criticized by family for ruining the marriage. The author is defending their action, saying Annie created the situation and that using the child as an argument is unfair. Now both the author and Frank are isolated and Frank is moving to the author's city.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nTo determine this, I need to consider the ethics of the author's actions. The key actions are: the author suspected infidelity but didn't have evidence, suggested a paternity test to Frank after drinking, which led to the discovery of the cheating. The author's family is blaming them for the fallout.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author's intention might matter. Did they have a right to confront Frank about their suspicions? Well, the problem is that the author didn't have concrete evidence. Suggesting a paternity test is a serious accusation. Even if they were concerned, making that comment, especially when inebriated, could be seen as crossing a line. Frank took it seriously, which led to the test and the marriage breaking down. The author's role was to support their friend Annie, but instead, they caused a major disruption in her life, leading to her financial instability and the child's paternity issue. \n\nHowever, the author argues that Annie was the one who created the situation by cheating. The author might feel they were trying to prevent a bigger problem by ensuring Frank wasn't raising a child that isn't his. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Even if the intention was good, without evidence, suggesting a paternity test could be considered meddling or overstepping. The author's family is upset because they believe they shouldn't have interfered. On the other hand, if Annie was indeed cheating, maybe the author was trying to uncover a truth that needed to come out. \n\nBut in terms of ethics, the author didn't have the right to push Frank into a paternity test without proof. It's possible that the author's comment was a trigger, even if it was based on suspicion. The fact that Frank took it to heart and acted on it, leading to the marriage's end, puts the onus on the author's role in the situation. The author's support for Frank might be seen as misguided if the primary issue is the infidelity and its consequences. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the child. The author dismisses using the child as an argument, but the child's well-being is a factor. If the child isn't Frank's, then the child's legitimate father might be absent, which is a different issue. However, the author's action led to Frank breaking off the relationship, which could affect the child's upbringing. \n\nThe author's family's criticism is that they should have kept quiet. But the author's intention was to help Frank, perhaps. The line between helping and meddling is thin here. Without direct evidence of infidelity, the author's suggestion might be seen as an overreach. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have had good intentions, the action of suggesting a paternity test without evidence could be considered inconsiderate and overstepping, leading to the breakup. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). However, another perspective is that the author was trying to uncover the truth, which is important for the marriage's integrity. But in terms of ethical responsibility, without evidence, it's a gray area. \n\nBut given the context, the author's suggestion directly caused the paternity test and subsequent fallout. So the author is partially responsible. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
