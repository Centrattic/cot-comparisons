It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author suggested a paternity test to their friend Frank, who was the cheated-on husband. The test revealed the child wasn't his, leading to the marriage breaking down and Frank moving away. The author is getting flack from their family for speaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's sister figure, Annie, was having an affair, and the author had suspicions but didn't directly confront her. They mentioned the paternity test idea when they were drunk. Frank later acted on it, which led to the truth coming out. Now the author is blamed by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for suggesting the test. Let's consider the moral aspects. Did the author have a right to intervene? The author is close to both Frank and Annie. They felt a sense of duty to Frank, perhaps. But Annie's actions are her responsibility. The author's suggestion, while perhaps well-intentioned, might have been out of line. However, if Annie was cheating and the author suspected it, maybe they had a right to speak up for their friend.\n\nAnother angle: the author wasn't in a position to know the full story. They might have acted on a hunch, and their intervention led to a painful outcome. On the other hand, if the author's suggestion led directly to the breakdown, is that their fault? Maybe, but Frank made the decision to get the test after the author's comment. The author's role was indirect. Also, Annie's actions were the root cause. She was the one who cheated and had an affair, leading to the child not being Frank's. The author's suggestion brought that to light, which some might see as justifiable.\n\nBut then, did the author overstep? The author is a friend, not a spouse, so maybe they shouldn't have meddled. However, given the close relationship and the potential for a child not being Frank's, some might argue the author had a duty to speak up. The family is blaming the author for ruining the marriage, but the real problem was Annie's infidelity. The author's actions exposed the truth, which can't be a bad thing, even if it caused pain.\n\nAlso, the author's parents and siblings think they should have kept quiet. But supporting a friend in a marriage where there's infidelity might be seen as right. The author isn't the one who cheated; they're standing by Frank. So, in terms of wrongdoings, the author isn't at fault. The blame should be on Annie. The author's role was to help their friend uncover the truth, even if it had consequences.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely that the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
