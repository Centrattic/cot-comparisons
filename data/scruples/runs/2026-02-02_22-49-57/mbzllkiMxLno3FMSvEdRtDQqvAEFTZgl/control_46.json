It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, let's call them Person A, is friends with Annie and Frank. Annie cheated on Frank, and the baby isn't his. Person A suggested a paternity test after drinking, which led Frank to get one and find out. Now, Frank is angry, Annie is in a tough spot, and Person A is getting criticized for speaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of Person A. They noticed something off for three years but didn't confront Annie directly. Instead, they made a comment to Frank during drinking. Maybe they thought it was a casual suggestion, but it ended up causing a major fallout. The question is whether Person A overstepped.\n\nOn one hand, Person A had a concern about the baby's paternity and felt it was important enough to bring up. They might be trying to protect Frank from being deceived. But on the other hand, the way they approached it was through a friend, not directly with Annie. Also, they might have assumed the worst without knowing all the facts. \n\nAnnie's infidelity is the root problem here. Person A didn't create the cheating situation, but their comment led to the confrontation. However, if Frank had been in a good marriage, he might have addressed the issues before it escalated to infidelity. But since he didn't, maybe Person A's intervention was necessary, even if it came off as impulsive.\n\nThe people around Person A are telling them to stay quiet, but Person A is standing by their belief that Annie was the one who made the situation. It's a tough call. The author isn't the one who cheated, but they did play a role in exposing the infidelity. Depending on the perspective, some might say they had no right to interfere, while others might think they did the right thing to protect Frank from being a non-biological parent.\n\nI think the key here is whether Person A had a right to question the paternity. Since they weren't a parent themselves, they might have overstepped by making the suggestion. However, given that Annie and Frank were close friends, Person A might have felt a responsibility. But since the main issue was Annie's cheating, the real blame lies with her. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but they did make a comment that had consequences. It's a bit of a gray area, but I'm leaning towards B, the author is not in the wrong because the main fault is Annie's, and the author tried to help Frank even if it backfired.\n"
