It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe story is about Frank and Annie. The author is a close friend of both, like a sister to Annie. Frank is married to Annie, and he works in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. Over three years, the author felt something was off, suspecting Annie was cheating but couldn't do much because they live 1000 km apart. Then, when they announce a baby, the author, during a visit where they had a lot of beer, suggests a paternity test. Frank takes that seriously, gets a test, and it turns out the baby isn't his. The author is blamed by Frank's family and friends for causing the marriage breakdown. The author stands by their decision because they think Annie created the situation by cheating.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is wrong for supporting Frank after cheating on him. The author's main action was suggesting the paternity test when they were drunk, which led to Frank finding out about the affair. Now, the author is being criticized for ruining the marriage and is isolated from family and friends. They argue that Annie was the one in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Did the author have a right to intervene? The author is close to both parties, so they might feel responsible. However, suggesting a paternity test, especially after drinking, could be seen as meddling. But the author might have had reasons to suspect infidelity based on their closeness to Annie and Frank. However, they didn't have proof; just a feeling. \n\nIn some cases, if someone suspects infidelity, the best course is to let the married couple handle it. The author's suggestion led to the discovery of the affair, which Frank might not have done otherwise. But was it the author's place to push for a paternity test? If Frank was already considering it, maybe the author just reinforced his suspicions. However, the author's comment was taken seriously, leading to the test. \n\nAnnie's actions are clearly wrong\u2014cheating and not disclosing the affair. But the author's role here is complex. They might have acted out of concern for Frank, but the way they did it (after drinking) might have been inappropriate. However, the author isn't the one who cheated. The family is blaming the author for speaking out, but maybe they should be holding Annie accountable.\n\nThe author's support for Frank could be justified if they believed he was being wronged. The key point is whether the author overstepped by suggesting the test. However, since Annie was emotionally cheating and the child wasn't Frank's, the author might have been trying to prevent further harm. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one who committed the infidelity. The blame should primarily be on Annie. The author's actions, while perhaps intrusive, were aimed at uncovering the truth. So, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They acted based on their suspicions and tried to help Frank, even if their method was questionable. The family's reaction might be unfair, as the real issue is Annie's betrayal.\n"
