It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where the author (let's call them \"the narrator\") is friends with both. Frank was cheated on by Annie, and the narrator helped him realize that by suggesting a paternity test. The question is whether the narrator did something wrong by making that suggestion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The narrator was close to Annie and Frank, even being like a sibling. Annie was having an affair, but there was no direct evidence. The narrator noticed something off but couldn't do much from 1000 km away. Then, when the baby came along, the narrator, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank took the advice and found out the child wasn't his. Now, the narrator is being blamed for ruining the marriage.\n\nThe main points here are: Did the narrator overstep by suggesting the test? Was it their place to intervene? The key is that the narrator wasn't directly involved in the cheating but felt something was wrong. Their intent was to help Frank uncover the truth. However, the timing and way they suggested it might have been a mistake, especially if it was during a vulnerable moment after drinking. But intent matters here. The narrator didn't want to destroy the marriage; they thought Frank should know the truth. \n\nOn the other hand, the narrator's suggestion led directly to the breakup. Frank and Annie are now separated, and the narrator is isolated. Friends and family blame the narrator. But Annie was the one who was unfaithful and emotionally cheating. The narrator is arguing that Annie created the situation, and the \"child card\" is unfair because the child isn't Frank's. \n\nSo, is the narrator in the wrong? If the narrator genuinely believed there was infidelity and the paternity test was a reasonable step for Frank to take, then maybe not. But did they cross a line by intervening without concrete evidence? The narrator had a feeling but no proof. Suggesting a paternity test is a big move that can end a marriage. However, in some cases, it's a necessary action if there's a reasonable suspicion. \n\nThe narrator might be in the right because they were trying to help a friend uncover the truth. But they might also be in the wrong if they shouldn't have meddled in a personal matter without being asked. The fact that Annie was emotionally cheating adds complexity. Emotional cheating can be harder to prove, but the narrator's suggestion led to the truth coming out. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the narrator isn't in the wrong because their intent was to help Frank know the truth. Even though the situation ended badly, the narrator's action was based on concern for a friend. The blame should be on Annie for her infidelity, not the narrator for trying to help.\n"
