It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The person is asking if they (the author) are in the wrong for supporting the husband, Frank, who discovered his wife Annie had an affair and the baby isn't his. The author's role was suggesting a paternity test after a few beers, which led to the discovery.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has known Annie since childhood and acted as a sister figure. They noticed something off but couldn't do much from far away. The key point here is that the author didn't have direct evidence of the infidelity or the baby's paternity. They just had a feeling, which isn't proof. However, they made a suggestion that led to Frank taking action, which uncovered the truth.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). The author's intention was to get Frank to consider the possibility of infidelity, which he did later. The author didn't fabricate the situation; they were trying to help Frank address what they sensed was a problem. But maybe their approach was inappropriate. Suggesting a paternity test without evidence can be seen as insinuating something serious, even if it's a feeling. That might have caused unnecessary harm if the suspicion was unfounded. However, in this case, the test confirmed the issue, so the suggestion was valid in the end.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be blamed for not having enough proof and still bringing it up, which could be considered meddling. But since they have a long history and close relationship with Annie, maybe their concern was justified. The fact that Frank later insisted on the test shows that the suggestion made him act on it, leading to the truth. The author's parents and siblings think they should have stayed silent, but the author believes Annie was the one who created the situation by cheating. \n\nThe isolation from friends and family is a result of the fallout, but the author's role was a catalyst. However, if the cheating was real, then the truth coming out was inevitable. The author's suggestion might have just expedited a necessary confrontation. \n\nI think the main issue here is the lack of direct evidence. But the author's intention was to help Frank get to the truth. Even though the suggestion came up in a casual setting (after beers), it led to Frank taking the right steps. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The blame should probably lie more with Annie for the infidelity and the resulting consequences. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
