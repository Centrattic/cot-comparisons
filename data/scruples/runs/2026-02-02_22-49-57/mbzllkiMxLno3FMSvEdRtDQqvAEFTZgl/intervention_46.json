It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband. The situation is that the author's friend Annie married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. For three years, Annie never explicitly admitted to cheating, but the author had a feeling. Then when they found out Annie was pregnant, the author suggested a paternity test after a few beers. Frank took it seriously, and the test confirmed he wasn't the father. Now Annie is left without Frank's income and a home, and the author is being blamed by family and friends.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author was close to both Frank and Annie, like a sister to Annie. The author noticed something off but couldn't act on it due to distance. When the pregnancy happened, the author, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank took it seriously, and the test revealed the infidelity. Now, Annie is facing financial and housing issues, and the author is being criticized for causing the marriage breakdown.\n\nThe main question is whether the author did something wrong. The author's action was bringing up the idea of a paternity test, which led to the discovery. But was that the right thing to do? On one hand, Annie was cheating, so Frank had a right to know the truth about his child. On the other hand, the author might have acted out of suspicion without concrete evidence, leading to public shaming or ruining a marriage.\n\nConsider the context: the author was close to both and had a feeling something was off. The author's suggestion led to the truth coming out, which could be seen as helping Frank. However, the method of bringing it up was during a drunk conversation, which might not be the best approach. But the author didn't have proof, just a suspicion. The author's intention was likely to help Frank, not ruin the marriage.\n\nAnnie's actions (cheating) were the root cause. The author's role was to express concern, which led to the truth. The consequences now are on Annie, not the author. The author isn't responsible for the outcome; Annie's infidelity is the main issue. The author's family and friends are blaming them for speaking up, which might be misplaced blame.\n\nAlso, the author is being criticized for the child's sake, but if the child isn't Frank's, then the child's well-being is tied to the truth. Frank has a right to know, and the author's suggestion helped uncover that. So the author isn't in the wrong for encouraging the test. The real responsibility lies with Annie for the affair.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
