It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister-like figure Annie, who married Frank. The husband Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. For three years, the author felt Annie was emotionally cheating but couldn't do much from 1000 km away. Then, when they found out Annie was pregnant, the author casually suggested a paternity test after drinking, which led to Frank getting one and discovering the baby isn't his.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for suggesting the paternity test. The author argues that Annie was the one who created the situation, so they feel justified. Others are criticizing the author for ruining the marriage and being insensitive to the child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author didn't have direct evidence of cheating but had a suspicion. They made a comment in a social setting (after beers) that led to Frank taking action. The author's intention might have been to help Frank avoid being a father to someone else's child, but the way they approached it could be problematic. \n\nEmotional cheating is different from physical cheating. Even if Annie was emotionally unfaithful, the author's suggestion to test the baby's paternity might have overstepped. Frank has his own responsibility to be certain about the paternity. The author's comment, even if well-intentioned, might have been a breach of trust or privacy. \n\nAlso, the author is being blamed by family for causing the breakup. They might have thought their comment was just a joke but it had serious consequences. Maybe the author should have handled the situation differently, like approaching the couple more carefully or not bringing it up at all. \n\nOn the other hand, Annie's infidelity (emotional and then physical) is a major betrayal. Frank has the right to know if the child isn't his. The author's suggestion led to Frank getting the truth, which is important for his own well-being and the child's legitimacy. But the method of suggesting it in a casual way, especially after drinking, might have been inappropriate. \n\nThe key points are: the author's role in prompting the test, the lack of direct evidence of cheating, the consequences of the marriage ending, and the impact on the child. The author didn't know the child wasn't Frank's, just suspected Annie's infidelity. However, making such a suggestion without solid evidence could be seen as meddling. \n\nBut if Annie was emotionally cheating and the author had a justified suspicion, maybe they weren't entirely wrong. It's a gray area. The author's action had unintended consequences, but they might not be entirely at fault. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author tried to help Frank avoid a potential future problem by getting the truth. However, the way they did it might have been unwise. The responsibility also lies with Frank and Annie to resolve their issues without involving the author. \n\nSo, the answer is probably a mix, but the user wants a choice between A or B. Since the author acted on their suspicion without direct proof and caused a fallout, they might be in the wrong. But if the suspicion was based on real clues, maybe not. The paternity test revealed the truth, which is necessary for Frank. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because Annie was unfaithful, and the author was trying to help Frank get the truth. Even if the approach was blunt, the outcome was justified. However, the method could have been better. But the user is defending their stance, so the AI might lean towards B.\n"
