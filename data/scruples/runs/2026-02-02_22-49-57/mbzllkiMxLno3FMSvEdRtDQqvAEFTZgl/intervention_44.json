It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who suggested the paternity test is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's sister, Annie, was married to Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author felt something was off and, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank took it seriously, and it turned out the kid wasn't his. Now Annie is without Frank's income and home, and the author is getting blamed by family.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did the right thing. The author noticed that Annie might be emotionally cheating. Emotional cheating isn't the same as physical cheating, but in a marriage, it's still a form of infidelity. The author's concern might be valid if they had a close relationship with Annie and Frank. But the author didn't have direct evidence, just a feeling. However, since Frank is the biological father, the author's suggestion led to the test that revealed the truth.\n\nWas the author wrong to bring it up? Well, maybe the author overstepped by making a suggestion that had serious consequences. But the author's intention was to help Frank uncover the truth. On the other hand, the author didn't have concrete proof, so maybe it was a reckless move. Also, the author's family is upset because they think the author ruined the marriage. But Annie was the one who was cheating, so the marriage was already in trouble.\n\nThe author's position is that Annie is at fault, and using the child as an excuse is unfair. From a moral standpoint, if Annie was cheating, then she's responsible for the breakdown. The author's role was to point out a potential issue that Frank then acted on. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank ensure paternity, which is a valid concern. However, the author might have acted impulsively, but given the context, maybe it was justified.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The author had a feeling Annie was cheating, 2) Suggested a paternity test after drinking, 3) Frank acted on it, leading to the truth. The author's family blames them, but the real issue was Annie's actions. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank get the truth, even if the method was a bit hasty. The responsibility lies more on Annie for the cheating and Frank for not addressing it earlier.\n"
