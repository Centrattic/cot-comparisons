It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, let's call them Alex, has a close friend Annie who married Frank. Frank is in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. During their 3-year marriage, Annie never outright admitted to cheating, but Alex had a feeling. Then when they found out Annie was pregnant, Alex, during a drunk conversation, suggested Frank consider a paternity test. That led Frank to get a test, which confirmed the baby wasn't his. Now Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and Alex is getting blamed by family for ruining the marriage. Frank is moving away, and both Alex and Frank are isolated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Alex suspected Annie was cheating but didn't have proof. The act of suggesting a paternity test might have been based on a hunch. But was it right for Alex to bring it up, especially when drunk? Maybe alcohol led to a comment Alex wouldn't have made sober. But then Frank took it seriously and got the test. \n\nAnnie's situation is complicated. She's part-time and now without Frank's income. But she was the one having an affair, which is a betrayal. Frank, while he's dealing with the aftermath, is also making decisions based on the test. But some might argue that Frank's reaction was extreme, leaving Annie without support. However, she was the one who cheated.\n\nAlex's role is tricky. They intervened based on their suspicion, but without concrete evidence. The question is whether it was right to push for a paternity test. On one hand, Alex might have saved Frank from raising a child that isn't his. On the other, it's possible that the suggestion was premature, causing unnecessary harm. Also, the fact that Alex is getting blamed by their family suggests there's a perception that they overstepped.\n\nBut considering that Annie was emotionally cheating, maybe even physically, and Alex had a long-standing relationship with both, maybe the intervention was justified. However, the method\u2014bringing it up drunk\u2014might not have been the best approach. But the outcome led to the truth coming out, preventing Frank from being a father to someone else's child.\n\nSo, is Alex in the wrong? They had a suspicion, acted on it, and the truth was revealed. Annie's actions were clearly wrong. Frank's decision to walk away might be a consequence of his job's stress and the cheating. But Alex's actions led to the exposure of the cheating. However, the way it was handled\u2014via a drunk comment\u2014might have been inconsiderate. But given the outcome, maybe it's not entirely Alex's fault. The answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
