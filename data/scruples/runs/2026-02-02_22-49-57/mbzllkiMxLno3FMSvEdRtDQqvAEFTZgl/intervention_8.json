It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA story) is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage.\n\nFirst, the author, let's call them Dan, has a close relationship with Annie. He's known her since childhood and considers her a sister. Frank is in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. During their marriage, Annie was allegedly cheating emotionally, leading to the child not being Frank's. Dan, after some drinks, suggests a paternity test, which leads to Frank discovering the infidelity.\n\nDan's family is upset because he \"ruined the marriage\" by suggesting the test. But Dan believes Annie was the one who created the situation. The question is whether Dan is in the wrong for bringing up the paternity test suggestion.\n\nSo, let's consider the key points. Was Dan justified in bringing up the paternity test? He had a feeling something was off, but Annie never explicitly admitted cheating. He was drunk when he made the comment. However, Frank later took it seriously and acted on it. The test revealed the child wasn't his, leading to the breakdown. \n\nNow, in terms of responsibility, if Dan's suggestion led directly to the discovery, does that make him at fault? It's a tricky one. On one hand, he was trying to help Frank by suggesting a test based on his suspicions. On the other hand, if he didn't have concrete evidence, maybe he shouldn't have brought it up. But since Annie was emotionally cheating, even if she didn't have sex, it's still a betrayal. However, the paternity test revealed infidelity beyond just emotional, making the test valid in that case.\n\nAnother angle: Dan's family is criticizing him for causing the breakup. But Annie's actions (cheating) were the root cause. Dan's comment was a suggestion, not a direct accusation. Frank made the choice to pursue the test and confront Annie. So Dan's role was more of a catalyst, not the sole cause.\n\nAlso, considering the relationships, Dan is close to Annie but still tried to support Frank by helping him verify the situation. His family might not see it that way, but from a moral standpoint, supporting someone in uncovering the truth about their marriage could be seen as right.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because he acted on his suspicions, which were based on his observations. The main issue was Annie's infidelity, and Dan's suggestion led to the truth coming out, which might have been necessary for Frank to move on. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
