It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Frank and Annie. The author is friends with both and kind of close to Annie like a sister. Frank was cheating, or at least Annie was cheating on him. The author noticed something was off and suggested a paternity test, which led to Frank finding out the baby wasn't his. Now the author is getting blamed by family and friends for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the facts. The key points here are: Annie had an affair, the baby isn't Frank's, the author suggested a paternity test, which Frank used to confront Annie. The author's family is upset because they think the author shouldn't have said anything. The author defends that Annie created the situation and using the child as a reason is unfair.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's action was making the suggestion about the paternity test. The problem is that the author wasn't in a position to know for sure, but had a feeling. But the author's relationship with Annie is close, so maybe they had a reason to feel something was wrong. However, the author is not in a direct relationship with either Frank or Annie. They live far away, so maybe they weren't in the best position to intervene.\n\nBut the paternity test was the catalyst for Frank finding out. The author's suggestion led Frank to get the test. So, if Annie was indeed cheating, then the author's suggestion helped Frank uncover the truth. However, the author's method of bringing it up was after a few beers, which might be seen as not the right time. But the author's intention wasn't to destroy the marriage; they were concerned about Frank. \n\nOn the other hand, Annie's actions are clearly wrong. Cheating and having a child with someone else is a betrayal. The author's family is blaming them for \"ruining a good marriage,\" but it was Annie's actions that caused the marriage to fall apart. The author's role was to point out something they noticed, which led to the truth coming out. The author isn't directly responsible for the cheating; they just helped Frank discover the truth. \n\nThe author is being blamed for the fallout, but the main responsibility lies with Annie for cheating. The author's suggestion was honest concern, even if it was intrusive. It's possible that the author overstepped by suggesting the test, but given the close relationship and the concern for Frank, it might be seen as justified. \n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if they had no right to interfere. Since they're not part of the marriage, they might not be the right person to make that suggestion. But given the close family ties and the potential for the child not being Frank's, maybe the author had valid reasons. \n\nIn the end, the author's action led to the truth being revealed, but the responsibility for the marriage's breakdown is on Annie. The author's family is upset, but maybe they don't see the bigger picture. The author isn't entirely wrong, but perhaps they should have approached it differently. However, the core issue is Annie's infidelity, so the author's role is more of a catalyst rather than the main wrongdoer. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
