It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where the author (let's call them \"the narrator\") is supporting Frank, who was cheated on. The narrator's sister figure, Annie, had an affair, and the baby isn't Frank's. The narrator suggested a paternity test, which led to the breakup, and now they're getting shamed by their family.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue here is whether the narrator is at fault for suggesting the paternity test. The narrator's parents and siblings are upset because they think they shouldn't have said anything. The narrator argues that Annie created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair. \n\nLet me consider the moral aspects. Cheating is generally seen as a betrayal, so Annie is clearly at fault. However, the narrator's role in exposing the infidelity through the paternity test is the point of contention. The narrator's intention might have been to help Frank uncover the truth, which is understandable if they suspected something was wrong. But was it right to push for a paternity test, especially after some alcohol?\n\nOn one hand, the narrator is standing up for what they believe is right\u2014supporting Frank against his cheating wife. On the other hand, they might have overstepped by suggesting the test, even if indirectly. The fact that Frank later acted on the suggestion complicates things. The narrator's family thinks they should have stayed silent, which is a common perspective\u2014maybe they think it's none of their business. But the narrator has a close relationship with Annie, almost like a sister, so maybe they felt invested in the situation.\n\nAlso, the aftermath: Frank is now isolated and moving away, and Annie is left without financial support. The narrator is being blamed for ruining the marriage. But Annie's actions were the root cause. The narrator is defending their stance, thinking Annie was the one who created the problem. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is often about overstepping boundaries. The narrator did point out their suspicion, which led to the test. Even if they had good intentions, maybe they shouldn't have meddled. However, if they had a close relationship with both Frank and Annie, perhaps they felt they had a right to intervene. \n\nAnother angle: the paternity test was a direct confrontation. The narrator's suggestion might have been a catalyst. But even if they didn't suggest it, Frank might have found out eventually. The problem is that the suggestion came from the narrator, making them a target of blame. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the narrator isn't the one who cheated, so they aren't directly at fault. However, their intervention might have caused more harm than good. It's a judgment call whether their support for Frank in uncovering the truth is justified. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the cheating spouse is primarily responsible. The narrator's actions were based on their belief that Frank was being cheated on, and while they might have overstepped, the main fault lies with Annie. Society often holds cheaters accountable, so the narrator isn't the one in the wrong here. The family's reaction is misplaced because the real issue is Annie's infidelity and the resulting consequences.\n"
