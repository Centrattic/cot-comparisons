It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where the author (let's call them the narrator) is a close friend of Annie's family. Frank was cheating, but not physically\u2014Annie was emotionally unfaithful, and the baby isn't Frank's. The narrator suggested a paternity test, which led to Frank finding out.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the narrator was wrong to support Frank by suggesting the test. Let's break it down. First, the narrator had a suspicion that Annie was cheating but didn't have concrete proof. They lived far away, so maybe they couldn't interfere much. Then, during a visit, after some drinks, the narrator mentioned a paternity test. Frank took the suggestion seriously, did the test, and found out the baby wasn't his. Now, the fallout has affected everyone, and the narrator is being blamed by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFrom the perspective of the narrator's actions: They were trying to help Frank, right? They noticed something was off and thought the paternity test was a good idea. But maybe they overstepped? Because they weren't in the marriage themselves. On the other hand, they might have been protecting Frank from being deceived. The key here is whether the narrator had a right to intervene. Even though they were close friends, the marriage is between Frank and Annie. The narrator's suggestion might have been a way to help, but it's possible that they shouldn't have meddled, especially since it led to the breakup and the current isolation.\n\nBut then again, the narrator wasn't the one who cheated. The cheating was on Annie's side. The narrator might feel that Frank was being wronged, so their suggestion was justified. However, maybe they should have approached it differently, like talking to Annie first or not bringing it up in a casual setting. The problem is that the suggestion came from the narrator, even if it was meant to be supportive. But if the narrator had just kept their mouth shut, maybe Frank wouldn't have found out and the marriage might have continued, even if it was built on a lie. But is it better to let Frank be deceived for the sake of the marriage?\n\nThere's also the aspect of the child being used as a reason to defend Annie. The narrator argues that Annie created the situation, so they shouldn't use the child as a shield. The narrator might be right in thinking that Annie's actions were the root cause. However, the narrator's role is as a friend, so they might not be responsible for the consequences of their suggestion. But since the suggestion directly led to the discovery, some people might think the narrator is partly at fault for not keeping their mouth shut.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, community opinion often hinges on intent versus consequences. The narrator's intent was to help Frank, but the consequences were severe. However, if Annie was truly cheating, maybe the marriage was already on shaky ground, and the narrator's intervention was necessary. Alternatively, it's possible that Frank should have addressed the issue directly with Annie before taking the suggestion. \n\nSo, is the narrator in the wrong? It's a tough call. If the narrator had a strong suspicion and tried to help, maybe they aren't entirely wrong. But if they didn't have concrete evidence and just acted on a hunch, that might be seen as overstepping. Also, the fact that they did this after drinking might affect how responsible they are perceived to be. However, the main issue is whether the suggestion to get a paternity test was a valid way to support Frank. If Frank later took it upon himself to do the test, then the narrator's role was just a catalyst, not the direct cause. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The narrator was trying to support a friend in a situation where they had valid concerns. While the method might have been questionable, the underlying issue was Annie's infidelity, which is a significant betrayal. The narrator isn't responsible for Frank's decision to act on the suggestion. So, the blame should lie with Annie for her actions, not the narrator for trying to help.\n"
