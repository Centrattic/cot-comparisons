It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complicated. So, Annie and Frank got married, and Frank is in the oil industry with a schedule that keeps him away for two weeks on and two off. The author, who's close to Annie, noticed that maybe Annie was seeing someone else. But since they live 1,000 km apart, the author couldn't do much. Then when the baby was on the way, the author, after a few beers, suggested a paternity test. That led Frank to insist on one, which revealed the baby wasn't his. Now, Annie is without Frank's income and home, moving back with her parents. The author is being blamed by family for breaking up the marriage and is isolated now.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the author's actions. The key point here is whether the author overstepped by suggesting the paternity test. The author's intention might have been to help Frank realize the truth, especially since they had a close relationship. But was it the author's place to say something? Frank might have felt betrayed by the author's suggestion, especially if it was during a drunken moment. However, Frank later insisted on the test himself, so maybe the author's comment was just the catalyst. \n\nAnnie's actions are at the core here. She was emotionally cheating, which led to the affair and the child not being Frank's. The author might have felt that Frank was being unfair or in denial, so the suggestion was to protect Frank. But the author's family is criticizing them for interfering. \n\nThe author's parents and siblings think they should have kept quiet, arguing that they ruined a good marriage and are being selfish by not considering the child. But the author stands by their belief that Annie was the one at fault. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author's action was a suggestion that led to the test. However, the main responsibility lies with Annie for the infidelity. The author might have crossed a line by not being sure and possibly acting on suspicion without solid evidence, especially under the influence. On the other hand, the author might have been trying to help a friend (Frank) who was being blindsided. \n\nIt's a tough call. If the author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling, then suggesting a paternity test could be seen as meddling. But if they genuinely believed Frank was being cheated on and wanted to protect him, it's hard to say it's entirely their fault. The fact that Frank later agreed to the test suggests he had doubts too. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the main wrongdoer is Annie, and while the author's actions had consequences, they were trying to uncover the truth. However, if the author acted recklessly without evidence, maybe they share some blame. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the situation, the author's intent was to help, even if the method was questionable. So, B might be correct.\n"
