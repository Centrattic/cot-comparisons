It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband. So the situation is that the author's sister-like friend Annie is married to Frank, who works in oil and has a work schedule that's 14 days on and off. The author felt that Annie was cheating but couldn't do much because they live far apart. Then, when Annie becomes pregnant, the author suggests a paternity test, which Frank takes seriously. It turns out the kid isn't his, and now Annie is left without Frank's income and a home. The author is getting blamed for ruining the marriage and is isolated from family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. The author didn't have direct evidence of infidelity but acted on a feeling. They mentioned the paternity test after a few beers. That might have been a careless comment, but it led to Frank getting proof. The key point is whether the author overstepped by suggesting the test. \n\nAnnie had been cheating emotionally and possibly physically, but she didn't confront it directly. The author's suggestion might have been the catalyst for Frank to take action. However, the author was concerned for Frank's benefit, thinking he might be raising someone else's child. \n\nBut the author didn't know for sure. Even though they had a feeling, they didn't have proof. So, maybe the author's intervention was premature. Still, Frank decided to take the test based on that comment. The author might not be entirely responsible since Frank made the choice to act on it.\n\nNow, the aftermath: Annie is left in a worse position, and the author is being blamed. The author's family thinks they should have stayed silent. But the author believes Annie was at fault. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author had concerns and expressed them, even if it was during a drunken moment. The intention was to help Frank avoid being wronged. However, the author didn't have evidence, so maybe they shouldn't have brought it up. But on the other hand, Frank had the right to know. The author's role here is a bit murky. They might not be in the wrong because they were trying to protect their friend, but they might have overstepped. \n\nBut considering that Annie had been cheating for years without confronting her, the author's action might be justified. The real responsibility lies with Annie for her actions. The author's comment was a catalyst, but the decision to do the test was Frank's. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
