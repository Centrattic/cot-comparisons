It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister figure, Annie, who cheated on her husband Frank. The author suggested a paternity test, which led to the discovery the child isn't Frank's. Now, they're getting criticized for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's role here is crucial. They had a feeling something was off and, after a few beers, suggested a paternity test. The husband didn't act on it immediately but later did. The test proved the child wasn't his. The author's family is upset, saying they shouldn't have spoken up. The author is defending themselves by saying Annie is at fault.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, is the author responsible? Well, they didn't know for sure Annie was cheating; they just had a suspicion. By suggesting the test, they were trying to get the truth. But did they overstep? Maybe. However, they were close to both and felt it was their role to help. Frank later took action, so the author's comment was a catalyst but not the direct cause. The problem is whether the author had the right to intervene in a way that led to exposing the infidelity. \n\nBut Annie was the one cheating. The author didn't have proof, just a feeling. It's understandable for a friend to express concerns, even if it's without evidence. However, in that context, suggesting a paternity test might have been a heavy step. But given the circumstances, maybe it was necessary. The author isn't directly responsible for the cheating; they just tried to help. The family's judgment of the author is misplaced because the real issue is Annie's actions. The author's suggestion led to the truth, which is morally right in the long run, even if it caused short-term pain. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
