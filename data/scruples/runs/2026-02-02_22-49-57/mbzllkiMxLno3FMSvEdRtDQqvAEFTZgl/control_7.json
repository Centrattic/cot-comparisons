It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author (let's call them \"Me\" for simplicity) has a close friend Annie, who's married to Frank. The key points are that Annie was cheating, which Frank found out about because of Me suggesting a paternity test. Now Frank isn't the father of the child, and Annie is facing a tough situation financially and socially. Me is being blamed by family for causing the breakdown of the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the roles each person played. Annie was the one who cheated, which is obviously a major issue. But the question is whether Me was wrong to suggest the paternity test. Let's break it down.\n\nMe noticed something was off and, during a visit, asked Frank if he was thinking about a paternity test, which led Frank to get one. The problem here is whether Me had the right to bring up such a sensitive topic, especially if they weren't close enough to justify it. However, since Me considers Annie more like a sister and has known her since childhood, maybe they felt a sense of responsibility.\n\nBut here's the catch: Me didn't have concrete evidence that Annie was cheating. They just had a feeling. In that case, bringing up a paternity test could be seen as a serious accusation. Even though Frank later got the test, it was his own decision to act on the suggestion. So maybe Me isn't entirely to blame because it was Frank who took the next step. However, Me's comment did plant the seed, so to speak. \n\nThen there's the emotional cheating part. Emotional cheating can be just as damaging as physical infidelity. If Annie was emotionally involved with someone else, that's on her. The child not being Frank's is a direct result of her infidelity. So the main wrongdoer here is Annie. \n\nNow, considering the aftermath. Me is being blamed for ruining the marriage. But the marriage was already in trouble because of Annie's actions. Me's suggestion led to the truth coming out, which might have been inevitable. If Frank couldn't figure out the cheating on his own, maybe he's also partly at fault for not noticing. However, he works in a job with long shifts, so maybe he wasn't around enough. \n\nThe key issue is whether Me overstepped by suggesting the paternity test. It's possible that Me had a valid concern because of the long-standing friendship with Annie and noticed things that Frank didn't. But without evidence, it's a risky move. However, since the result was that Frank discovered the cheating, which is the right outcome, even though it's painful. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if someone knows a friend is being unfaithful and tries to help the wronged partner realize it, is that their responsibility? It's a tough call. On one hand, Me might have acted out of concern. On the other, maybe they shouldn't have inserted themselves into the situation.\n\nThe fact that Frank later blamed the suggestion on Me complicates things. But does that make Me wrong? If they had the intention to help Frank uncover the truth, and the means were a suggestion that led to the test, perhaps Me isn't in the wrong. The responsibility for the cheater is on Annie, and Frank's reaction is his own choice. \n\nAlso, the consequences for Me and Frank being ostracized by family and friends suggests that the community or their families are more sympathetic to Annie, which could be because of the \"innocent child\" argument. But if the child isn't Frank's, that's a result of Annie's actions. Using the child as a reason to defend Annie might be a way to avoid accountability.\n\nIn conclusion, while Me might have been overstepping by suggesting the test without knowing for sure, the main wrongdoer is Annie. Me's actions were aimed at revealing the truth, which is morally right, even if the method was questionable. However, the question is whether Me is in the wrong. Considering Frank took the test on his own, perhaps Me isn't entirely at fault. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
