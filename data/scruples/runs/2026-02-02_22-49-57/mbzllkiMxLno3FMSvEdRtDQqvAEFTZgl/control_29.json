It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend, Annie, who was married to Frank. The author, who's close to Annie like a sister, suspected that Annie was cheating because Frank was away a lot for work. The author then, during a visit, mentioned the idea of a paternity test to Frank after drinking. Frank took that suggestion seriously and got a paternity test, which confirmed the baby wasn't his. Now, Annie is facing financial difficulties and moving back in with her parents. The author's family is upset because they think the author shouldn't have said anything, while the author believes Annie was at fault and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the author's actions were justified. The author had a suspicion but no concrete evidence. They brought up the idea of a paternity test in a casual, possibly drunken conversation. Even if the author thought Frank should check, suggesting it without knowing the full story could have led to consequences. But on the other hand, if Annie was indeed cheating and having a child with someone else, maybe the author had a right to be concerned for Frank's well-being. However, the author didn't confront Annie directly or give her a chance to explain before bringing it up with Frank. That might have been a mistake.\n\nAlso, the author's relationship with both Frank and Annie is close, but they might have overstepped by advising Frank to do a test, especially since they weren't in a position to know all the facts. The author's family is criticizing them for ruining the marriage, which is a common reaction in such situations. The author is defending themselves by saying Annie created the situation, which could be true, but the question is whether the author's role was inappropriate.\n\nThe key points are: the author acted on a suspicion without proof, suggested a paternity test in a possibly inappropriate context (drunk), and now the consequences have led to a broken marriage. The author might argue they were protecting their friend Frank, but they might also have interfered in a private matter without knowing the whole story. It's possible that the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they had concerns, but their method of addressing them could be questioned. However, since the author's action (suggesting the test) directly led to the breakup, even if indirectly, it's possible they share some responsibility. But if Annie was truly unfaithful, maybe the author was justified. The answer hinges on whether suggesting a paternity test without evidence is considered wrong. In many cases, people might say the author overstepped, so the answer might be A. But others might think it's the right thing to do if they suspect infidelity. Hmm. I need to weigh these factors.\n"
