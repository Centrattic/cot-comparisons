It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who suggested the paternity test is in the wrong. The story involves Frank and Annie, who are married. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author of the story has known Annie since childhood and considers her a sister. \n\nThe key points here are: the author sensed something was off but didn't have direct proof of infidelity. They mentioned the possibility of a paternity test while they were both drunk, which Frank later took seriously. The test confirmed the baby wasn't his. Now, the author is being criticized for ruining the marriage and causing both Frank and themselves to be isolated.\n\nSo, the main question is: Did the author do the wrong thing by suggesting the paternity test? Let's consider the ethics. Infidelity is a serious issue in a marriage. If one partner is unfaithful, the other has the right to know. However, the author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. But they lived far away and couldn't intervene much. The suggestion during a moment of alcohol might have been impulsive, but it led to Frank getting the test done, which uncovered the truth.\n\nThe other side is that the author might have overstepped by bringing up the idea when they weren't close enough to Frank to know his relationship's dynamics. However, since the author has a close relationship with Annie, maybe they felt compelled to speak up. The outcome was that Annie's infidelity was revealed, leading to her financial instability and the couple's separation. The author is now blamed by family and friends for causing the breakup.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the author's suggestion led to the discovery of the infidelity, which was already happening, then they might not be at fault. The marriage was already in trouble, and the author's action exposed it. However, if there was no evidence, maybe the author should have kept quiet. But since the result was the truth coming out, which is necessary for Frank to know, the author's role might be justified. It's a tough call because it's hard to know if the marriage could have been saved without the test. But Frank's decision to get the test was his own, so the author isn't entirely responsible. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
