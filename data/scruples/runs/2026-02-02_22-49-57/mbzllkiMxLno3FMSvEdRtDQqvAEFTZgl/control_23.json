It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend, Annie, who had a husband, Frank, who was cheating. The author, let's call them Alex, is being blamed for causing the breakup because they suggested a paternity test after Frank was emotionally unfaithful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Frank works in a job that keeps him away for two weeks on and two weeks off. Annie didn't directly confess to cheating but had a baby that wasn't Frank's. Alex noticed something off and asked Frank about a paternity test after some drinks. Frank took the suggestion seriously and found out the truth. Now, Annie is in a tough spot financially and emotionally, and Alex is being criticized for speaking up.\n\nSo, the question is whether Alex is at fault. On one hand, Alex is a friend who noticed something and tried to help Frank. They might have done it in a moment of drinking, but the intention was to uncover the truth. On the other hand, maybe Alex overstepped by suggesting the test, even if they were concerned. But Annie was the one cheating, so the root cause is her actions. The user argues that Annie created the situation, and using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nI should also consider if Alex had the right to interfere. They live far away, so they weren't directly involved in Frank's marriage. But as a close friend, maybe they had a concern. However, the decision to do a paternity test was ultimately Frank's. Alex's role was just suggesting it, which might have been a good thing in the long run to uncover the truth. The family is blaming Alex for breaking up the marriage, but the marriage was already problematic due to Annie's infidelity.\n\nTherefore, the main responsibility lies with Annie for her actions. Alex tried to support Frank, even if it led to a painful outcome. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
