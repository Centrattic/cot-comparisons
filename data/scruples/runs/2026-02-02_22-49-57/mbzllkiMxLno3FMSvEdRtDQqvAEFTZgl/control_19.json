It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about Frank and Annie's marriage. The author, who's close to Annie like a sister, suspected that Annie was cheating because Frank was away a lot. The author then suggested a paternity test during a casual conversation when they were both drunk. That led Frank to get a test, which confirmed the baby wasn't his. Now Annie is dealing with the aftermath, losing her husband's income and home, and the author is facing backlash from their family for \"ruining the marriage.\"\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's role in suggesting the paternity test. The author didn't have direct evidence but had a suspicion. They mentioned it in a casual setting, which might not be the best approach. But was it wrong to bring it up? The author's intent might have been to help Frank, given their close relationship. However, without concrete evidence, making such a suggestion could be seen as intrusive or causing unnecessary harm.\n\nAnnie's actions of cheating led to the breakdown of the marriage. The author isn't the one who cheated, but by bringing up the idea, they might have accelerated the discovery of the infidelity. The family is blaming the author for the consequences, which is a bit unfair because Annie's actions were the root cause. The author's intention was to help Frank, but the method was flawed. Maybe a better approach would have been to talk to Frank privately about their concerns without implying the need for a test in a drunken conversation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have malicious intent. They might genuinely care about Frank and wanted to ensure the child's paternity. However, the way they approached it was careless. The question is whether the author is responsible for the fallout. Since the cheating was Annie's choice, she's the one at fault. The author's suggestion, while perhaps tactless, wasn't a deliberate act to destroy the marriage. The family's reaction is misplaced blame. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but their approach could have been better.\n"
