It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (let's call them Alex) suggesting a paternity test to their friend Frank, which led to the discovery that Frank wasn't the baby's father. Now, Frank and Annie are separated, and Alex is being criticized for causing the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. Alex has a close relationship with Annie, who's like a sister. Frank is in a marriage where Annie was cheating, both emotionally and physically. Alex, after drinking, suggests a paternity test. Frank takes it seriously, does the test, finds out the baby isn't his. Now Alex is blamed for ruining the marriage.\n\nSo, is Alex at fault? Well, Frank was married to Annie, and it's his responsibility to address any suspicions. If Annie was cheating, Frank should have confronted her. Alex's suggestion might have been the catalyst, but if Frank already had doubts, maybe he was looking for validation. However, Alex was just a friend who noticed something off and decided to bring it up, even if it was in a casual setting.\n\nBut was it Alex's place to suggest such a thing? Intervening in someone else's marriage can be tricky. Alex might have thought they were helping Frank avoid raising a child that isn't his. On the other hand, Frank should have handled it himself. Alex's role as a friend might have crossed a boundary by pushing for a test. \n\nPeople are now blaming Alex for the fallout, but the root cause was Annie's infidelity. Frank's decision to act on the suggestion is his own choice. So maybe Alex isn't entirely at fault. However, bringing up the idea, especially when drunk, might not be the best approach. \n\nThe question is whether Alex is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the suggestion was justified. Since Annie was the one who cheated, the fault lies there. Alex, as a concerned friend, tried to help. But maybe they shouldn't have meddled. However, if Frank was already suspicious, maybe the suggestion just gave him the push he needed. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The main issue is Annie's actions. Alex's role was to support Frank, and suggesting a paternity test was a way to help him get clarity. The blame should be on Annie for the infidelity, not on Alex for trying to help uncover it.\n"
