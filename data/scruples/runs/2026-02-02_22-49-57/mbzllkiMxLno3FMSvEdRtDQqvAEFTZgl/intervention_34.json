It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband by suggesting a paternity test. The situation involves Frank and Annie, who had a child that isn't Frank's. The author knew Annie since childhood and felt something was off, so during a visit, after some drinks, suggested a paternity test. Frank later insisted on getting one, found out the child wasn't his, and now Annie is facing financial issues and they're both isolated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects here. The author noticed something was wrong but didn't have direct proof. They were living far away, so maybe they couldn't intervene much. But when they did visit, they made a suggestion that led to the paternity test. The key point is whether the author's suggestion was justified or overstepping.\n\nOn one hand, Annie was cheating, and Frank has the right to know if the child isn't his. The author's intention might have been to help Frank uncover the truth. However, the author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. Suggesting a paternity test could be seen as a way for Frank to confirm his suspicions. But the author might have crossed a line by bringing up the idea when they weren't sure. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author's comment led to Frank taking action and the subsequent fallout could make others think the author is responsible for breaking up the marriage. The parents and siblings are blaming the author for ruining the marriage, but maybe that's because they don't see the cheating as Annie's fault. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that Annie created the situation by cheating, and they think it's unfair to use the child as an argument. But the child is innocent here. However, the parent of the child is the one who cheated, so maybe the child isn't directly to blame. \n\nIn terms of ethics, sometimes people have a duty to speak up if they suspect harm. But in personal relationships, it's more complicated. The author might have acted out of concern, but without clear evidence, it's possible they overstepped. However, if Frank was considering a paternity test on his own, the author's comment might have just accelerated an inevitable action. \n\nAnother angle: the author's suggestion was made in a casual setting (after beers), which might not be a professional or appropriate time. But intent matters. If the author genuinely believed in Frank's right to know, their actions could be seen as justified. \n\nConsidering all this, it's a tough call. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank uncover the truth. However, they might have acted without enough certainty, which could be seen as meddling. But given that Annie was cheating, the author's role in revealing the truth could be seen as right. \n\nSo, probably answer B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they were trying to help their friend discover the truth, even if the method was a bit hasty.\n"
