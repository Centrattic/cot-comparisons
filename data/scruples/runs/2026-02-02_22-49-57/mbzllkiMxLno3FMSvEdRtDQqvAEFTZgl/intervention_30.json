It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, after the situation unfolded. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the story is about a close friend, Annie, who cheated on her husband Frank. The author has known Annie since childhood and considers her a sister. Frank is in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. Over three years, the author felt something was off, maybe Annie's behavior, but couldn't intervene due to the distance. When the couple announced a baby, the author, after a few beers, suggested a paternity test. Frank took it seriously, got the test done, and found out the child isn't his. The author is blamed by family for ruining the marriage, and now both Frank and the author are isolated. The author defends their stance, saying Annie was the one who created the situation and that using the child as a reason is unfair.\n\nThe key points here are the author's actions. They suggested a paternity test, which led to Frank getting one and catching Annie in emotional and physical infidelity. The author is now being criticized by their family for speaking up. The question is whether the author is wrong for supporting Frank after the situation came to light.\n\nI need to consider if the author had the right to make that suggestion. The author wasn't a direct witness but had a feeling something was wrong. The suggestion was made in a casual setting (after drinking), but it led to the truth coming out. However, was it the author's place to intervene, especially from a distance? Also, the author's family is upset because they think they shouldn't have meddled. \n\nOn one hand, the author might have acted out of concern for Frank and the child. They wanted to ensure the child's legitimacy, which could affect Frank's future. On the other hand, the author might not have enough evidence to justify the paternity test. The suggestion could have been based on intuition rather than facts, leading to a breakdown in the marriage. The author's support for Frank after the truth emerged is also a point\u2014supporting a wronged husband isn't inherently wrong, but the initial suggestion might be seen as crossing a line.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author noticed over the years that something was off, which might indicate a pattern of behavior from Annie that others missed. The fact that the paternity test revealed infidelity would support the author's initial suspicion. In that case, the author's action led to the truth being uncovered, which is in Frank's best interest. The family's criticism might be more about the author taking the initiative without being asked, rather than the content of the suggestion itself.\n\nAnother angle: The author's relationship with Annie is close, but they also have a bond with Frank. If the author felt that Frank was being cheated on and the child wasn't his, not speaking up could also be seen as complicity. By bringing up the paternity test, the author might have acted out of a sense of justice or loyalty to Frank, even if it wasn't directly asked.\n\nIn terms of whether it's wrong, it's a judgment call. Some might say the author overstepped by making that suggestion without concrete evidence, while others might see it as a necessary step to uncover the truth and prevent Frank from being deceived longer. The author's support for Frank afterward could be justified if the infidelity was proven, but the method of intervention is debatable.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer hinges on whether the author had a right to act on their suspicions. Since they weren't in a position to confront Annie directly and the suggestion led to the truth, it's possible the author is not in the wrong. However, the way it was done (after drinking, perhaps impulsively) might be seen as a misstep. But given the outcome, the intention was likely to help Frank, which could be seen as the right thing to do.\n"
