It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author (the person in the story) is wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband. The situation involves Annie, who was married to Frank, and the author's role in suggesting a paternity test.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author had a close relationship with Annie since childhood, like a sister. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. Over three years of marriage, Annie never directly admitted to cheating, but the author felt something was off. When a baby was on the way, the author, during a visit with lots of alcohol, suggested a paternity test to Frank. The comment stuck, Frank insisted on a test, and it turned out the child wasn't his. The author is now facing criticism from family for causing the breakup, and Frank is moving away.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about the author's intentions. The author felt a \"feeling\" but didn't have concrete evidence. They suggested the test in a casual setting with alcohol, which might have been a mistake. However, the author's concern might have been genuine, given the long-distance marriage and possible emotional cheating. \n\nBut did the author overstep? The author is a friend, not a parent or spouse. While they might have suspected something, suggesting a paternity test without evidence could be seen as interfering. However, the story says Annie had been emotionally cheating, which Frank later found out. The author's suggestion led to the truth coming out, which might have been necessary for Frank to know. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's comment was made in a social setting, possibly influenced by alcohol, and without knowing the full story. The aftermath caused a rift in families, and the author is blamed for ruining the marriage. However, if Annie was indeed cheating and the child isn't Frank's, then the author might have helped Frank avoid a lifelong lie. \n\nBut maybe the author didn't have the right to push Frank toward a paternity test. It's possible the author acted out of concern but overstepped. On the flip side, if the author's intuition was correct, then the action was justified. The key here is whether the author had the right to interfere. Given the close relationship and the fact that the author was close to both Frank and Annie, maybe they felt responsible to act. \n\nHowever, the author's role as a friend doesn't give them the authority to make that decision. Frank should have been the one to decide whether to take the test. The author's suggestion might have been intrusive, even if well-intentioned. \n\nBut considering the outcome\u2014Frank discovered the infidelity and the child isn't his\u2014it's possible the author's intervention was necessary. However, the method might have been inappropriate. The author might have crossed a boundary by suggesting something so invasive without knowing all the facts. \n\nIn summary, while the author's intention was to help Frank uncover the truth, the method might have been wrong. Friends do have a duty to be honest, but suggesting a paternity test based on a feeling could be seen as overstepping. So the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong), but there's a counterargument for B (not in the wrong). The key is whether the author had the right to push for the test without more evidence.\n"
