It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about Frank and Annie's marriage where Frank found out his wife cheated, leading to a breakup and some fallout. The author, who's close to both, suggested a paternity test during a drunken conversation, which led to the discovery.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author knew there were suspicions about Annie's infidelity but didn't have concrete evidence. By suggesting the paternity test, the author might have thought they were helping Frank confirm his doubts. But was it right to bring it up, especially while drunk?\n\nWell, even if drunk, the author's comment still triggered action from Frank. However, the author's intention was probably to support Frank by helping him get the truth. But did the author overstep by pushing for a test? The author wasn't in the marriage, so maybe they overestimated their role in Frank's decisions. But on the other hand, if they had known about the cheating and kept quiet, that might also be problematic.\n\nNow, considering the consequences: Annie ended up without financial support and her home. The author is being blamed by family for ruining the marriage. The author argues that Annie created the situation, so they're not at fault. The child is mentioned, but the author feels it's unfair to bring that up since Annie was the one who cheated.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the key points are whether the author had the right to intervene, the context of the suggestion (drunk), and the outcomes. The author might not have been in the wrong because they were trying to help a friend uncover the truth. However, they might have acted impulsively without considering the consequences. But since the infidelity was on Annie's side, the author's role is more of a supporter rather than a wrongdoer.\n\nAnother angle: Did the author have a duty to remain neutral? Since they weren't part of the marriage, maybe they overstepped. But they had a close relationship, which might justify their concern. The fact that Frank later decided on his own to get a test suggests the author's suggestion was a catalyst but not the sole cause.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably isn't in the wrong. They were trying to support a friend and expose the cheating, which was Annie's fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
