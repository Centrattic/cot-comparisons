It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person telling the story) is in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. \n\nFirst, the situation: Frank and Annie were married. The author, who's close friends with Annie, suspected infidelity but couldn't act on it from afar. Then, when Annie got pregnant, the author suggested a paternity test during a casual conversation. Frank took the suggestion seriously, got the test done, and found out the child wasn't his. Now, the author is facing backlash from their family for causing the marriage to break down, and they feel Annie is the one at fault.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the key points. The author didn't have concrete evidence of infidelity, just a feeling. They made a suggestion during a drunk conversation, which Frank later took action on. The author's intention was to help Frank ensure the child's paternity, which is a valid concern. However, the suggestion came out of a feeling rather than evidence, which could be seen as meddling. \n\nAnnie's actions were deceitful; she didn't directly admit to cheating, and the child isn't Frank's. The author's suggestion led to the discovery of the infidelity, which exposed the truth. Even though the author might have overstepped by making the suggestion without evidence, the root cause of the problem was Annie's actions. \n\nThe family is blaming the author for the fallout, but the main issue was the cheating. The author's intent was to uncover the truth, which is a reasonable action once a partner is suspected of infidelity. However, the method might have been hasty. Still, since the truth was already there, the author isn't entirely responsible. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not be entirely blameless for suggesting the test without knowing for sure, the responsibility primarily lies with Annie for the infidelity and deception. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
