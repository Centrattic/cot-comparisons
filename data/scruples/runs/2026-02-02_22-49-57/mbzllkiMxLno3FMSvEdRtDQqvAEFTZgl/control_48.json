It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the husband, Frank, who was cheated on. The situation involves the author suggesting a paternity test, which led to Frank discovering that the child isn't his. Now, the author is facing criticism from family for ruining the marriage and is isolated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's suggestion of a paternity test was made after several beers, which might imply it was a casual or offhand comment. However, it's clear that Frank took it seriously and acted on it, leading to the discovery that he wasn't the biological father. The wife, Annie, was emotionally cheating, and after the paternity test confirmed infidelity, Frank is left with financial and emotional consequences, including the loss of his family relationships.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer should be based on ethical considerations. The author's intention was to help Frank ensure the child was his, which is a reasonable concern given the context of a potential affair. However, the method of bringing it up\u2014after a lot of alcohol\u2014might not have been the best approach, but the suggestion itself isn't inherently wrong. The author didn't know for sure there was an affair before the test; they had a feeling, which is common in such situations. \n\nAnnie's actions are clearly unethical if she was emotionally and physically unfaithful. The author isn't responsible for her decision to cheat. The criticism from the family towards the author seems to be misplaced blame. The author's role was to voice a concern that turned out to be valid, even if it caused the marriage to end. Suggesting a paternity test is a factual approach to resolve a suspicion, and once the truth came out, it's Annie's actions that led to the consequences, not the author's suggestion directly. \n\nAlso, the author is supporting Frank, which is understandable given the betrayal. The isolation from friends and family is a result of the fallout from the cheating, not the author's suggestion. Frank is relocating because of the situation, not necessarily because he's immature as some have accused. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help a friend uncover the truth. The fault lies with Annie for the infidelity, not the author for raising a valid concern. Even if the way it was brought up could have been handled better, the underlying issue was Annie's actions. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
