It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their friend Annie who married Frank. The author feels that Annie was cheating because they had a feeling, and then when Frank found out the baby wasn't his, he got a paternity test. The author suggested the test, and now Frank is upset, and the author is being blamed by their family.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the dynamics here. The author knew Annie since childhood and considered her a sister. They noticed something off but couldn't act on it because they lived far away. Then, when the baby was coming, they asked Frank if he was thinking about a paternity test. That led to the discovery that the kid wasn't his. Now, Annie is dealing with the consequences, and the author is being criticized for speaking up.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have a right to bring up the paternity test? The user says Annie never admitted to cheating but the author had a feeling. The author's suggestion led to Frank getting the test, which revealed the infidelity. Now the author is being blamed for ruining the marriage and causing the family to be isolated.\n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. They were concerned about their friend Annie's fidelity, but they didn't have concrete evidence. The author's role is complicated here. They might have thought they were helping Frank by pointing out the possibility, but without clear proof, bringing up the paternity test could be seen as interfering. However, Frank did end up getting the test and found out the truth, which might mean the author's suggestion led to the truth coming out.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't know for sure Annie was cheating, just had a feeling. They might have been trying to help Frank, but their suggestion caused a rift. However, if the marriage was already in trouble because of Annie's actions, maybe the author was right to speak up. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being blamed by their family for causing the breakup. The author's family thinks they should have kept quiet. But the author believes Annie created the situation by cheating. The author's motivation was to get the truth out, even though it was a difficult situation.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's action led to the truth being revealed, but did they have the right to bring it up? Since they were close to both parties, maybe they felt responsible. However, without concrete evidence, suggesting a paternity test could be seen as meddling. But if they truly believed something was wrong and Frank was being honest with them, maybe they had a duty to speak up.\n\nThe answer would depend on whether the author acted with good intentions but overstepped, or if they were justified in pointing out their concerns. Since the truth came out and Frank was betrayed, the author might not be entirely at fault. However, the way they approached it (after drinking) might have been hasty. So, the answer could be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), as they were trying to help, but it's a complex situation.\n"
