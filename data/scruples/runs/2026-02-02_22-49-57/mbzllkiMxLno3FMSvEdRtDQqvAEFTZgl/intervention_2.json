It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband by suggesting a paternity test. The situation is complicated. The author's sister-in-law Annie had an affair, and the baby isn't Frank's. The author, living far away, had a feeling but couldn't do much. During a visit, after some drinks, he suggested a paternity test. Frank took it seriously, leading to the discovery.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author didn't have direct evidence but had a suspicion. He brought it up in a casual setting, which might have been inappropriate. However, he didn't know for sure. His intention was to help Frank confirm the paternity, which is understandable. But the way he approached it\u2014after a few beers\u2014could be seen as careless. \n\nFrank acting on that comment led to the divorce and the current situation. The author is being blamed by his family for ruining the marriage. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, arguing Annie created the situation. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nLegally, suggesting a paternity test isn't illegal. Emotionally, it's tricky. The author had a suspicion but no proof. Even if the suspicion was right, bringing it up without evidence could be seen as an invasion of privacy. However, the author wasn't the one who committed the infidelity. The main issue is whether the author's action directly caused the breakup. Frank chose to act on the suggestion, so the responsibility might lie with Frank too.\n\nThe author's parents and siblings are upset, but the author believes Annie is at fault. The isolation from friends and family adds to the conflict. The author's main defense is that Annie was the one who created the situation. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the author's intent was to help a friend, but the method was flawed. However, without proof, the suggestion might have been the only way Frank could confirm the truth. The author's actions led to the truth coming out, which is necessary but painful. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He acted on a suspicion, and the consequences were due to Frank's decision to act on that suggestion. The blame should primarily be on Annie for the infidelity, not the author for trying to uncover the truth.\n"
