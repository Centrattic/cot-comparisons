It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a close friend (Annie) and her husband (Frank). The author, who's like a sister to Annie, suggested a paternity test after suspecting infidelity. This led to Frank finding out the baby isn't his. Now the author is being criticized by family for causing the marriage breakdown.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a feeling for a long time but couldn't act on it from afar. When they saw a baby announcement, the author, after a few beers, suggested a paternity test. Frank took the suggestion seriously and did a test. The result showed the child isn't his. The author is now blamed for ruining the marriage, and there's tension with family and friends.\n\nThe author's main argument is that Annie was the one who created the situation (cheating), and using the child as an excuse is unfair. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting the test.\n\nPossible angles: Did the author overstep by suggesting a paternity test? The test led to uncovering the infidelity, which was already happening. If Frank was caught emotionally cheating, maybe the author's suggestion was a way to confirm the suspicion. But the author was a third party, not directly involved. However, suggesting a paternity test can be a sensitive action, especially if it's based on a feeling rather than evidence. The author might have been influenced by their own suspicions, which might not be justified. But given the long-term relationship and the author's close bond with Annie, maybe they felt they had some responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't know for sure, just had a feeling. Even if they did suggest it, Frank made the choice to do the test. The author might be blamed for not staying out of it, but if they were concerned, maybe they had a right to be. The family's criticism that the author ruined the marriage could be misplaced since the infidelity was already happening. The child's situation is a result of the infidelity, not the suggestion of the test. So using the child as a reason to blame the author doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because the suggestion led to uncovering the truth, which Annie was responsible for. The author's role was a catalyst, but the real issue was Annie's actions. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
