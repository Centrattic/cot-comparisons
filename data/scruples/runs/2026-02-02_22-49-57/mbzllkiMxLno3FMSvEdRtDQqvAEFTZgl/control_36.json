It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister-in-law Annie who cheated, the husband Frank found out due to the author's suggestion about a paternity test, and now there's fallout. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author knew Annie for a long time and felt something was off in her marriage. They suggested a paternity test jokingly after some drinks, which led Frank to take it seriously. The test revealed the child wasn't his. Now the author is getting criticized for causing the breakup and Frank is isolated.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break down the actions. The author had a suspicion but no proof. They made a comment in a casual setting, which Frank took to heart. Did the author overstep? Well, suggesting a paternity test is a serious action. But was there a duty not to mention it? The author wasn't in a position to know for sure, so maybe they shouldn't have brought it up without evidence. However, they might have thought they were helping Frank by pointing out the possibility.\n\nOn the other hand, Annie was cheating, which is morally wrong. The author's comment might have been the catalyst for Frank to confront the issue. But is the author responsible for the consequences? Frank made the decision to get the test after the author's suggestion. The author didn't force him; he acted on his own. So maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, the way they approached it\u2014casually after drinking\u2014could have been handled better. They might not have considered the impact of their words.\n\nAnother angle: the author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage. But Annie was the one who cheated. The author's role was indirect. It's possible the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank see the truth. However, they might have had no right to intervene in someone else's marital issues without being certain. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer hinges on whether the author's action was a reasonable concern or an overreach. Since there was no proof, the author might have acted in bad faith. But since the comment led to Frank taking action, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The line between concern and overstepping is blurry here. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they had a suspicion and voiced it, even if it led to unintended consequences. The main fault lies with Annie for cheating. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
