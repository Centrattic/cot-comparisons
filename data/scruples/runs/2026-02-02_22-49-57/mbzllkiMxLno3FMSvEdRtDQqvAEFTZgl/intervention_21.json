It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person who supported Frank, who was cheated on by his wife Annie. The key points are: Annie had an affair, the author suggested a paternity test which led Frank to find out the child wasn't his. Now the author is being blamed by family for ruining the marriage and is isolated.\n\nFirst, the author's role here. The author didn't know for sure that Annie was cheating; they just had a feeling. They asked Frank in a casual setting about a paternity test after drinking. The suggestion stuck, leading to the discovery. Was the author wrong to suggest the test? Well, if Annie was unfaithful, the father has a right to know about the child's paternity. The author might have been trying to help Frank uncover the truth he was already suspicious of. \n\nBut the author's intention matters. They thought they were helping, but the method was a bit hasty\u2014suggesting a test after a few beers. However, Frank later took it seriously, so maybe the author didn't intend to cause harm. On the other hand, the comment did start the chain of events that led to the breakdown of the marriage. \n\nAnnie's actions were definitely wrong by cheating. The author's suggestion might have been a catalyst, but the responsibility for the infidelity lies with Annie. The author's family is blaming them, but maybe they're not fully understanding the situation. \n\nThe author is defending their stance, arguing that Annie created the situation. The child being used as a card is a tricky part. But the child's existence is a result of the infidelity, so maybe the focus on the child is misplaced. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author's role was minimal. They acted on a suspicion and made a suggestion that Frank acted upon. The main issue is Annie's infidelity. The author isn't the one who committed the wrong here. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
