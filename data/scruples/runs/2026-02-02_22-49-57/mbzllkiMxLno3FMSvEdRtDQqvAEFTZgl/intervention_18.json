It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister figure Annie, her husband Frank, and a cheating scandal.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Annie cheated on Frank, the author suspected it but wasn't certain. They asked Frank about a paternity test after some drinks, which led to Frank discovering the infidelity. Now Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and the author is getting backlash from their family for \"ruining\" the marriage. The author stands by their actions, thinking Annie was the one who created the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They had a suspicion, but no concrete proof. Then they made a comment to Frank about a paternity test. That comment led to Frank taking action. The question is whether the author overstepped by bringing up the paternity test, especially after drinking. Even though it was after beers, the author's intention was to address a possible betrayal by Annie. But was it their place to do so?\n\nAnnie cheated, which is a serious betrayal. The author's concern for Frank's situation is understandable. However, the author might not have had a right to push Frank into taking such a drastic step as a paternity test. Even if the author had good intentions, maybe they should have let Frank handle it himself. The author's interference caused the marriage to end, leading to Annie's current situation. But Annie was the one who cheated, so is the author responsible for the consequences of her actions?\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a close relationship with Annie and Frank, acting as a sister. They might feel compelled to protect Frank from being a father to a child that isn't his. But again, the method of intervention (a casual comment after drinking) might not have been the best approach. The author might not be in the wrong because Annie's actions were the root cause. However, the author's role in bringing it up could be seen as meddlesome.\n\nAlso, the author is facing backlash from their own family for speaking up. The question is whether the author was right to do so. Since the author had a suspicion and tried to help Frank, maybe they aren't wrong. The consequences were harsh for Annie, but she was the one who cheated. The author's actions led to the truth coming out, which might be the right thing in the long run. However, the way they went about it might be questionable.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's intention was to help Frank. But they might have overstepped by involving themselves in their sister's marriage. The fact that Annie was cheating is a major factor. The author's actions led to the truth, but the method might not have been appropriate. So, it's a tricky situation. But considering that the author was trying to look out for Frank, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the way they did it could have been better handled. But since the outcome was the truth, maybe the author is not in the wrong.\n"
