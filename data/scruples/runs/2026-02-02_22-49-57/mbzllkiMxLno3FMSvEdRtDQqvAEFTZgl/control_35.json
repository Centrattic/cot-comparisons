It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a friend (Annie) who married Frank, and the author suspected Annie was cheating. The author casually suggested a paternity test after drinking, which led Frank to get one. The test confirmed the baby isn't his, and now Annie is left without Frank's income and home. The author is facing backlash for \"ruining\" the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a suspicion but no proof. They made a comment after drinking, which Frank took seriously. The comment led to the test, which exposed the infidelity. Now, the author is being blamed by family for the breakdown.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, the author didn't have direct evidence to accuse Annie. But they trusted their intuition enough to mention it to Frank. However, the way it was brought up\u2014after drinking\u2014might have been a casual comment intended as a joke or offhanded suggestion. The author probably didn't expect the test to actually happen, but it did, leading to the consequences.\n\nLegally, the author isn't responsible for Frank's decision to take the test. Frank had the choice to act on the suggestion. Emotionally, the author might feel guilt for causing the breakup, but they weren't the one who committed the infidelity. The question is whether the author overstepped. They might have if there was no proof, but given that Annie was emotionally cheating, maybe the author's intuition was right. However, without proof, they shouldn't have made the comment.\n\nBut the author's intention was to protect their friend Frank, right? They saw signs and wanted Frank to be sure. However, the method was questionable\u2014suggesting a paternity test based on suspicion without evidence. Maybe the author should have confronted Annie first or advised Frank to do so instead of pushing for a test.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might not be entirely wrong. The real wrongdoer here is Annie for cheating. The author's role was more of a catalyst, but they acted on a hunch. However, their comment did lead to the test, so there's some responsibility. But is it their fault? It's a tough call. The author didn't force Frank's hand; he made the choice. But the author's suggestion might have planted the seed that led to the breakdown.\n\nIn the long run, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help a friend. However, the way they did it was possibly inappropriate. But since they didn't have proof, maybe they shouldn't have said anything. But if they truly believed there was a problem, maybe they had a duty to mention it.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (the author isn't in the wrong) because the real issue is Annie's infidelity. The author acted on suspicion but didn't have malicious intent. The consequences were unintended, so they might not be at fault.\n"
