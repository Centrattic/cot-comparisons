It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person (the author) who supported a husband, Frank, after finding out his wife Annie had an affair and the child isn't his. The author suggested a paternity test, which led to the breakdown of the marriage. The author is getting blamed by family for causing the marriage to end, but they think Annie was at fault. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author noticed something was off and decided to mention the paternity test to Frank, even if it was after drinking. The test confirmed the suspicion, leading to Frank leaving Annie. The author's family is upset because they think the author shouldn't have interfered.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is the author wrong? Well, if Annie was cheating and having a child with someone else, that's a serious betrayal. The author might have felt compelled to help Frank discover the truth, especially if they had a close relationship. However, the author didn't have direct evidence, just a feeling. Suggesting a paternity test could be seen as encouraging Frank to take action based on suspicion rather than proof. But on the other hand, if the marriage was built on lies, the truth might come out eventually. \n\nThe author's intent was to help Frank, but the method might be questionable. Did they overstep by bringing up the paternity test? Maybe. But if Annie was emotionally cheating and the child isn't Frank's, the author might believe they were helping him avoid further deception. However, the author's role here is as a friend, and sometimes friends act on hunches. The problem is whether the author had the right to intervene without concrete evidence. \n\nAlso, the consequences are that Annie is now without financial support and Frank is isolated. But Annie's actions were the root cause. The author's suggestion led to the truth coming out, which might be necessary even if it caused pain. The author might not be in the wrong if their intention was to help Frank uncover the truth. However, they could be seen as meddling in a private matter without being certain. \n\nBut considering that Annie was cheating and the child isn't Frank's, the author's action, while potentially intrusive, might have been justified in revealing the infidelity. The real wrongdoing here is Annie's actions. The author is supporting Frank, who is the wronged party. So, the answer might be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong for helping Frank discover the truth about his marriage.\n"
