It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a close friend of Annie and Frank. They've known each other since childhood. The main issue is that Annie was cheating on Frank, both emotionally and physically, resulting in the baby not being Frank's. The author suggested a paternity test after drinking, which led to Frank getting the test and discovering the truth.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The author didn't know about the cheating for sure but had a suspicion. They suggested a paternity test, which was a sensitive topic, especially since Frank works in a job that keeps him away from home. The author's intention might have been to help Frank confirm his parental status, but their comment, even if made in a relaxed setting, might have been the catalyst for Frank to act.\n\nAnnie is now without financial support and a home, which is a consequence of the test revealing the infidelity. The author is being blamed by their own family for causing the breakdown of the marriage. The author argues that Annie created the situation, and using the child as a justification is unfair.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author had no direct evidence of infidelity but acted on a suspicion. Friends often intervene when they suspect something's wrong, but in this case, the lack of evidence might mean the author overstepped. However, the author's role was to be supportive and perhaps help Frank see the truth he might have ignored. On the other hand, the suggestion of a paternity test is a serious accusation without proof, which could damage trust and relationships.\n\nIt's a tough call. The author might not be entirely wrong because they were trying to help Frank, but they did make an assumption without concrete evidence. However, since Annie was indeed cheating, the outcome was justified, but the method might have been inappropriate. The author's intention was good, but the execution could have been better. Alternatively, since the author had a close relationship with both, they might have felt responsible to speak up.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might share some responsibility for bringing up the paternity test without solid evidence, but they were acting from a place of concern. However, given the outcome, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong because the truth came out, and Annie's actions were at fault. But maybe the correct answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they made an assumption and their comment led to the test. But others might argue B (not in the wrong) because they were protecting Frank's interests. Need to weigh the options carefully.\n"
