It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's sister figure, Annie, who was married to Frank. The author suspects Annie was cheating and, after some prompting, Frank gets a paternity test that confirms the baby isn't his. Now the author is being criticized for speaking up, and both he and Frank are isolated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author noticed something was off but didn't have direct evidence. They made a comment to Frank while drunk, which led him to get a paternity test. This action ended the marriage and caused a fallout with family. The author's defense is that Annie was the one who created the situation by cheating, but others are blaming the author for not staying quiet.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author's intention was to help Frank discover the truth. Even though the comment was made under the influence, the author's concern was based on long-standing suspicions. However, the author might have overstepped by assuming Annie was cheating without direct proof and by suggesting a paternity test. The test confirmed the suspicions, but the manner in which it was approached could be seen as intrusive or meddling in Frank's marriage.\n\nAlternatively, the author has a close relationship with Annie, almost like a sister, so they might have felt responsible. But in a marriage, the responsibility to address infidelity lies with the spouse, not a third party. The author's involvement might have been unnecessary, even if the outcome was justified. The fact that the author's comment led to the test and subsequent breakdown could mean they played a role, even if unintended.\n\nConsidering the consequences, the author is now being blamed by family for ruining the marriage. The key is whether the author acted with malicious intent or just concern. Since the author believed Annie was unfaithful and Frank needed to know, their actions could be seen as trying to protect Frank. But it's also true that the author didn't have the authority to interfere in Frank's relationship. \n\nThe paternity test revealed the truth, which is the right outcome, but the method might be questionable. The author might have overstepped by not letting Frank handle the situation himself. Even if Annie was cheating, the author's role in pushing Frank to test could be seen as crossing a boundary. So, while the outcome was good, the means could be problematic. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility, making them at least partially in the wrong. However, if the author's actions were based on genuine concern and the test led to the truth, it's a tricky situation. The answer hinges on whether the author's role was justifiable or meddling. I think the answer is A (Yes) because the author intervened in a private matter without being asked, leading to the breakdown, hence in the wrong.\n"
