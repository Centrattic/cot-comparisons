It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA story) is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband. The scenario is that Annie had an affair, the child isn't Frank's, and the author suggested a paternity test, which led to the marriage breaking down. The author is being criticized by their family for \"ruining the marriage.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess the author's actions. They noticed something was off, asked Frank about a paternity test after drinking, and that comment led to Frank getting the test. But the key point is whether the author had a right to suggest the test. Since they were close to both and knew Annie well, they might have had concerns based on their relationship with Annie. However, the author wasn't in a position to know for sure if there was an affair, so suggesting the test was based on suspicion. \n\nWas it the author's responsibility to intervene? Since they weren't part of the marriage, their role is more of a friend or family member. However, if they had strong suspicions, maybe they felt obligated to act. But the problem is that the suggestion led directly to the breakdown, which the family is blaming the author for. \n\nAnnie was cheating, so she's clearly at fault. Frank choosing to get the test was his decision, even if the author's suggestion prompted it. The author's intention was to protect Frank's interests, which is understandable. However, the method of bringing it up in a casual setting after drinking might have been inconsiderate. But the author's role as a friend might justify the concern.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, no one is at fault here. Morally, the author might have acted out of concern but in a way that caused collateral damage. However, since the cheating is on Annie's side, the primary wrongdoer is her. The author's action was a catalyst but not an intentional betrayal. The author's family is criticizing them, but the author's motives are to help a friend. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They acted based on suspicions and a desire to help, even though it had unintended consequences. The main fault lies with Annie for cheating. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
