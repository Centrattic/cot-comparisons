It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong after suggesting a paternity test that led to the discovery of Annie's infidelity. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author is close to Annie and Frank, having known them since childhood. Annie and Frank were married for three years, with Frank working in a job that keeps him away for 14 days on and 14 off. The author suspected Annie was unfaithful but didn't have concrete evidence. After Frank found out the baby wasn't his and the author's suggestion led to the paternity test, things fell apart. The author is now being criticized by their family for causing the marriage to end, and Frank is relocating due to isolation.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants others' opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical aspects. \n\nThe author's role was to voice a suspicion they had, albeit during a drunken conversation. Even if they didn't have direct evidence, they felt it was important enough to bring up. Frank later took action based on that comment. The author's intent wasn't to ruin the marriage but to suggest caution. However, without knowing if the child was truly not Frank's, the suggestion might have been harmful. \n\nAnnie's infidelity was the root cause, but the author's comment was the catalyst. However, the author had a close relationship with Annie and Frank, so their concern might be seen as well-intentioned. On the other hand, the author's family is criticizing them for interfering. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, did the author overstep? If they had no proof, bringing up a paternity test could be seen as a breach of privacy or meddling. But if they genuinely suspected something, maybe they had the right to express concern, especially since the husband was being kept in the dark. \n\nThe consequences are severe for all parties, but the author isn't the one who committed the infidelity. The blame is on Annie, but the author's suggestion led to the test. However, the author might not have known the full context. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's action was a suggestion. The final decision to take the test was Frank's. The author can't be held entirely responsible for Annie's actions. The family's criticism might be misplaced. \n\nConsidering these factors, the author's intention was to help, even if it backfired. So, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
