It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Frank and Annie's marriage. The author is a close friend of Annie's, almost like a sister. Frank was working in the oil industry with a 14-day on and off schedule. The author had a feeling Annie was cheating but there wasn't much they could do from 1000 km away. Then when Annie got pregnant, the author, after some drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank took it seriously, did the test, found out the kid wasn't his, and the marriage fell apart. Now the author is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage, and they're isolated.\n\nFirst, the key points here are: the author suspected infidelity but didn't have direct evidence. The suggestion of a paternity test came up after drinking, which might have been a casual comment. The author didn't know for sure if Annie was cheating, but their comment led Frank to get the test. The result confirmed the child wasn't his, which ended the marriage. Now the author is being criticized for speaking out of turn.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, if Annie was actually cheating and the author had some suspicions, maybe the author was trying to help Frank uncover the truth. However, the author didn't have proof and just made a suggestion in a social setting. The problem is that the author's comment, even if well-intentioned, led to Frank getting a paternity test, which then exposed the infidelity. But was the author obligated to stay silent? Since the author was close to Annie, they might have felt responsible for her actions, but the author didn't have any direct role in the cheating. The author's suggestion was a way to confirm the truth, which Frank chose to act on. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's comment could be seen as an overstep since they didn't have evidence. However, the main wrongdoer here is Annie for cheating. The author's intervention, though perhaps not the best way, aimed at revealing the truth. The blame on the author seems misplaced because Annie's actions were the root cause. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank discover the truth that Annie had been hiding. The family's criticism of the author is unfair because the real issue was Annie's infidelity. So, answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
