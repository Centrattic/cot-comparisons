It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank. The situation involves a friend, Annie, who the author has known since childhood. The author's sister figure, Annie, married Frank, who works in a job with long shifts. The author suspected Annie was cheating but couldn't do much from afar. When Frank found out the baby wasn't his, he got a paternity test after the author suggested it, leading to the marriage breaking down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's intention was to help Frank ensure the child was his, which is a valid concern when there's a suspicion of infidelity. However, the way the suggestion was made might have been inappropriate. The author mentioned it during a drunken conversation, which could be seen as careless. But the suggestion itself was to protect Frank's interests. \n\nThen, there's the impact on the family and the author's relationships. The author is being blamed by family for ruining the marriage. But Annie was the one who was unfaithful, so the root cause is her actions. The author's role was to voice a concern, which might have been necessary for Frank to take action. \n\nHowever, the ethical dilemma here is whether the author overstepped by suggesting the paternity test. Even if the author's intention was good, bringing up such a sensitive topic without knowing all the facts might have been intrusive. But considering the long-term consequences of not knowing paternity, the author's suggestion could be justified.\n\nAlso, the author's family is criticizing them, but the main responsibility lies with Annie for the infidelity. The author isn't the one who caused the cheating; they just helped expose it. The isolation from friends and family might be a consequence of the situation rather than the author's fault. \n\nIn terms of the child, the author's stance that using the child as an excuse is unfair makes sense because Annie's actions led to the child not being Frank's. The author isn't responsible for Annie's choices. \n\nSo, balancing all factors: the author acted out of concern for a friend, made a suggestion that led to uncovering the truth, and isn't the root cause of the problem. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
