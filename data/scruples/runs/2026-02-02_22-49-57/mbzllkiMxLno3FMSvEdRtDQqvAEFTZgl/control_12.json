It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's sister-in-law, Annie, and her husband Frank. The author supported Frank when he discovered Annie was cheating, leading to a paternity test that revealed Frank wasn't the father. Now, the author is getting criticized for causing the marriage breakdown and people think they should have stayed silent.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is close to Annie, who married Frank. He worked in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author suspected Annie was cheating but didn't have proof. When Frank found out about the baby, the author suggested a paternity test after some drinks. Frank took the suggestion seriously, and the test confirmed the child wasn't his. Now the author is being blamed for ruining the marriage and causing Frank to lose his income and home. The author argues that Annie was the one who created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the moral aspects here. The author had suspicions about Annie's infidelity but didn't have concrete evidence. Making the suggestion under the influence of alcohol might have been a careless comment. However, the author's intention was possibly to ensure Frank's confidence in the child's paternity. But since Annie was already cheating, the author's comment led to the discovery, which ended the marriage.\n\nIs the author responsible for the outcome? Well, the comment was made in a social setting, and Frank took it seriously. The author didn't know for sure about the infidelity, just had a feeling. However, suggesting a paternity test is a serious accusation. Even if the author's intention was to protect Frank, the action contributed to the breakdown. But Annie is the one who committed the infidelity, so the author isn't the sole cause.\n\nThe family is blaming the author for causing the marriage to fall apart. But the root cause was Annie's actions. The author's role was a catalyst, but it's debatable whether they're at fault. If the author had no proof and the suggestion was made in a casual conversation, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, bringing up paternity in such a context without evidence could be seen as meddling.\n\nOn the other hand, Frank's decision to act on the suggestion is his responsibility. The author didn't force him to take the test. So the author's suggestion might not be the main issue. The real problem was Annie's cheating. The author's support to Frank could be justified as helping him confront the truth, even if it was uncomfortable.\n\nIn AITA situations, the community often considers intent and context. The author acted on suspicion without knowing the full story but had a close relationship with both parties. The outcome was negative, but the blame primarily lies with Annie. The author's actions were a response to a situation they were concerned about, even if it led to unintended consequences.\n\nTherefore, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong. They were trying to help Frank, albeit in a possibly inconsiderate way, but the main fault lies with Annie. The author's suggestion was a contributing factor, but not the sole cause. So the answer is B.\n"
