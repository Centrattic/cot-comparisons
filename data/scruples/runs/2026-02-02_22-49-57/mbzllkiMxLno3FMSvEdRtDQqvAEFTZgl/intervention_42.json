It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend Annie married Frank, who works in oil with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. The author suspected Annie was cheating but didn't have proof. Then when Annie got pregnant, the author casually suggested a paternity test after some drinks. Frank took it seriously, did the test, found out the kid wasn't his, and the marriage fell apart. Now the author is being criticized for causing the breakup and ruining the marriage, but they think Annie was at fault.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to voice a suspicion they had for a long time. They didn't have direct evidence, but they felt something was off. When they made the comment about the paternity test, it was in a relaxed setting after drinking. The key point is whether the author overstepped by suggesting the test. But since the author didn't know for sure, maybe they were just expressing a concern. However, suggesting a paternity test is a serious accusation, even if it's a \"just to be sure\" comment. But maybe the author didn't realize how impactful their words would be.\n\nFrank then decided to get the test based on that comment. The result showed Annie was cheating, so the marriage ended. The author is being blamed for the fallout. But Annie was the one who was unfaithful, so the root cause was her actions. The author's comment was a catalyst, but if Annie had been honest, maybe the situation would have been different. However, the author's role is tricky because they didn't have evidence but still made a suggestion that led to the test. Was it right to push for the test if there was no proof? Or was it just speaking their mind?\n\nAlso, the author's justification is that Annie created the situation, so they aren't to blame. The fact that Frank and the author are now isolated might be a consequence of the community's reaction. But does the author have a responsibility to not interfere? Since they were close friends, maybe they had a duty to speak up if they suspected infidelity. But without proof, maybe it's meddling. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the person who cheated is obviously at fault. The author's comment was based on suspicion, not certainty. Even if the comment led to the test, it's possible that the marriage was already in trouble, and the test just revealed the truth. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for bringing up their concern, especially if they genuinely suspected it. However, they might not have considered the potential consequences of their words, even if they were well-intentioned. \n\nBut in many cases, people are expected to keep their suspicions to themselves unless there's solid evidence. The author's suggestion might have been premature, but it was a result of genuine concern. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the real fault lies with Annie's infidelity. The community is punishing the author for something that was ultimately a result of Annie's actions. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), because it was a suspicion leading to the truth being uncovered, even if it caused the marriage's end.\n"
