It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband after the situation unfolded.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author, who's close to Annie (his \"sister\"), knew that Annie might be cheating on Frank, her husband. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author senses something's wrong, and when a baby is on the way, he suggests a paternity test to Frank during a casual conversation after drinking. The test reveals the baby isn't Frank's. The author's suggestion led to the discovery, which caused the marriage to break down. Now, the author is being criticized by their family for causing the problem and is supporting Frank as he moves away.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the author had a suspicion that Annie was cheating but didn't have direct evidence. Suggesting a paternity test might have been a way to get the truth. However, the author was close to Annie and Frank's family, so maybe they shouldn't have meddled. But on the other hand, if Annie was emotionally cheating, that's a betrayal, and the author might have thought Frank had a right to know about the potential child not being his. \n\nBut the key points here are: Did the author overstep by bringing up the paternity test? The author wasn't directly involved in the marriage, living far away. They might not have known the full context. Suggesting the test was a direct action that led to the marriage's collapse. Even if Annie was cheating, the author's role in causing the fallout could be questioned. \n\nHowever, if Annie's actions were indeed deceitful, the author might feel justified in helping Frank uncover the truth. But the problem is that the author's suggestion was the catalyst. The family might think the author shouldn't have interfered, especially since they were close to Annie. \n\nAnother angle: The author supported Frank despite the backlash from their own family. Is it wrong to support someone who was cheated on? The author's family is criticizing them for causing the marriage to end. But Frank had every right to know the truth about his child's paternity. So, the author's intention was to help Frank get the truth, which might be ethically right. However, the method of intervention might be questionable without direct evidence. \n\nIn the end, the paternity test was the right thing for Frank to do, but the author's role in suggesting it might be seen as overstepping. But if the author's intent was to help Frank, maybe they aren't in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but the answer depends on whether the suggestion was justified. Since the author had a suspicion but wasn't certain, maybe they shouldn't have encouraged the test. But if they had a valid reason, maybe it's okay. However, given that the author was close to Annie and now is supporting Frank, maybe the family's criticism is valid. But the author's support for Frank might be justified because Annie was the one who cheated. \n\nI think the answer hinges on intent and the right to privacy. The author might be seen as overstepping by interfering in someone else's marriage without concrete evidence. However, if the outcome was that Frank found out the truth, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" Since the author's suggestion led to the marriage ending, and they were close to Annie, their role could be seen as meddling. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But another perspective is that supporting someone who was cheated on is not wrong. \n\nWait, the author's family is saying they should have kept their mouth shut. If the author didn't have proof but just a feeling, suggesting the test might be overstepping. However, if Annie was emotionally cheating, then the author might think Frank deserved to know. But the author's knowledge of the situation is limited. The author might be in the middle of a family conflict they didn't start. \n\nI think the key here is that the author acted on a suspicion without evidence, which might not be their place. So, the answer could be A. But on the other hand, if the author's intention was to help Frank, maybe it's not wrong. It's a tough call. \n\nConsidering the typical AITA (Am I the Asshole) analysis, often the person who meddles without being asked is considered the asshole. So, maybe the author is at fault for suggesting the test. Therefore, answer A.\n"
