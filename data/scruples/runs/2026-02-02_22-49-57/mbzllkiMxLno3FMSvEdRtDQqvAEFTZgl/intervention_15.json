It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie. The author is a close friend of Annie's, almost like a sister. Frank was married to Annie but cheated emotionally, and the child isn't his. The author suggested a paternity test after drinking, which led to Frank finding out. Now, the author is being blamed by their family and friends for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author noticed something off but didn't have proof. They were in a position where they couldn't intervene much because they were 1000 km away. When they visited, after some alcohol, they mentioned the paternity test as a suggestion. Frank took it seriously, got the test, and it turned out the baby wasn't his. Now, Annie is facing consequences, and the author is being criticized.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author overstep? The author's intention was probably to help Frank discover the truth. But how? They didn't have evidence. Emotionally cheating is different from physical cheating. The author's suggestion might have been based on a feeling, not facts. However, once Frank acted on it, it led to the truth coming out.\n\nIs the author responsible? Well, if the author didn't know for sure, suggesting a paternity test could be seen as causing unnecessary conflict. But on the other hand, Annie was the one who had the affair. The author might have thought they were helping Frank avoid being the father of someone else's child. However, since there was no hard evidence, the author's suggestion could be seen as a breach of privacy or trust. \n\nBut wait, Annie was emotionally cheating. Emotional infidelity can be tricky because it's not as clear-cut as physical cheating. The author might have felt something was off but couldn't prove it. The paternity test was the only way to confirm. So maybe the author's intention was good, but the method was questionable because they didn't have proof. \n\nAlso, considering the outcome, Annie is now without financial support and a home. The author is being blamed for the fallout. But Annie's actions (cheating) led to the situation. The author's role was to suggest the test, which was the catalyst. However, if Frank had acted on the author's suggestion, they might be sharing some blame. But is the author entirely in the wrong? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author wasn't in the wrong because they were trying to help a friend (Frank) who was being cheated on. Even if they were wrong about the suspicion, suggesting a paternity test is a way to find out the truth. But since there was no evidence, it's possible the author meddled without knowing. \n\nAnother angle: The author's family is criticizing them for not keeping quiet. The author's stance is that Annie created the situation, which is true. But the author's action led to the discovery. So the question is whether it was right to suggest the test without proof. If the author had no proof, maybe they shouldn't have. However, the emotional cheating could have been a red flag. \n\nIn summary, the author might be in a gray area. But since they didn't have proof and just acted on a feeling, suggesting the test could be seen as overstepping. However, the fact that Annie was cheating is the root cause. But the author's suggestion caused the breakdown. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't have evidence and their action led to the marriage breaking down. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because Annie was the one cheating. \n\nBut the key is whether the author had a right to interfere. Since they were close to both, maybe they thought they were helping. However, without evidence, it's possible they were wrong to push for a test. So leaning towards A. But I'm not sure. Maybe B. Hmm.\n"
