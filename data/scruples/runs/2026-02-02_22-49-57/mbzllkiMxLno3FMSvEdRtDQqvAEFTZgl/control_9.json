It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong. The story involves Frank and Annie, where the author suspects Annie of cheating, and eventually Frank gets a paternity test that the author's suggestion might have prompted. Now the author is being criticized for ruining the marriage and causing a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author has known Annie since childhood and felt a sisterly bond. Frank was in a job that kept him away for two weeks at a time. The author had a suspicion that Annie was cheating but didn't have proof. They were close to Frank, and during a visit, after drinking, the author suggested a paternity test. Frank took that seriously, got the test, and found out the child wasn't his. The author now faces backlash for causing the divorce and the resulting fallout.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for supporting Frank and bringing up the paternity test. Let's think about the key points here. The author didn't know for sure Annie was cheating. They had a feeling but no evidence. However, the suggestion of a paternity test led Frank to act on it. The author's intention might have been to help Frank uncover the truth. But the problem is that without concrete evidence, suggesting such a test could be seen as a violation of trust or privacy.\n\nAlso, considering the relationship dynamics. The author is close to both Frank and Annie. By suggesting the test, the author might have overstepped their role as a friend. Even if they were concerned, the method of intervention could be problematic. Frank had the right to confront Annie directly if he suspected infidelity, but the author's suggestion might have pushed him into a situation where he didn't have the evidence, leading to a breakdown in the marriage.\n\nAnother angle: The author might not have considered the consequences of their words. The paternity test not only affected Frank and Annie but also the child and their families. The author's parents and siblings blame them for ruining the marriage. The isolation of both the author and Frank is a result of the fallout. This shows that the action had ripple effects beyond just the couple involved.\n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that Annie was the one who created the situation. The author might believe they were helping Frank by encouraging him to seek the truth, especially if they had long suspected something. But in relationships, trust is crucial, and without clear proof, suggesting a paternity test could be seen as undermining that trust without justification.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about intent versus impact. If the author genuinely thought they were helping and had a long-standing relationship with both parties, maybe their intent was good. But the impact was significant. The question is whether the author had the right to push Frank towards a paternity test based on a suspicion. If the author didn't have evidence, maybe they shouldn't have intervened so directly. Friends can express concerns, but suggesting a paternity test is a drastic step that could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, the fact that the suggestion came after drinking might add another layer. The author might not have been fully coherent when making the suggestion, which could imply that they weren't thinking clearly. However, the fact that Frank acted on it later shows that the suggestion had weight regardless of the context in which it was made.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention might have been to help Frank discover the truth, the method of doing so without evidence could be seen as crossing a line. The author's role as a friend might not include pushing for such a drastic action without clear justification. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong for contributing to the breakdown of the marriage without sufficient cause.\n"
