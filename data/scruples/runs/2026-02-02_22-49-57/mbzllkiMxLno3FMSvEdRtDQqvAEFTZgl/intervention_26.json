It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where the author (let's call them the narrator) is a close friend to both. The key points here are: the narrator suspected Annie of cheating for three years but didn't confront her directly. Instead, during a casual conversation after some drinks, the narrator suggested Frank consider a paternity test. This led Frank to get the test, which revealed the baby wasn't his.\n\nNow, the question is whether the narrator is at fault. First, I need to consider the context. The narrator lived far away (1000 km) and couldn't intervene much. They had a feeling something was off but didn't have concrete evidence. The suggestion was made in a social setting, possibly offhand. The narrator's intention might have been to help Frank, but it backfired, causing a breakdown in the marriage and personal consequences for all involved.\n\nEthically, this is tricky. On one hand, the narrator might have thought they were acting in Frank's best interest by encouraging him to get a paternity test. On the other hand, without solid evidence, bringing up such a sensitive topic\u2014even in a casual way\u2014could be seen as irresponsible. The narrator didn't confront Annie directly, so they didn't address the issue head-on. Instead, they nudged Frank, which led to the test. \n\nBut here's the thing: the test result confirmed the narrator's suspicion. If the narrator had stayed silent, the situation might have continued, with Frank raising a child that isn't his. That could be more harmful in the long run. However, the method of bringing it up was arguably careless, especially since it was after drinking and not a direct confrontation. \n\nThe narrator's family and others are upset because they believe the narrator ruined the marriage. But the root cause of the problem was Annie's infidelity. The narrator's role was more of a catalyst in revealing the truth, not causing the infidelity itself. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the narrator might share some blame for not handling the situation more carefully, but the primary wrongdoing here is Annie's. The narrator's intent was to help, even if the approach was flawed. The aftermath is messy, but the narrator's actions were driven by the belief that Frank deserved to know the truth. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. The main issue was Annie's actions, not the narrator's suggestion, even if the timing and method weren't perfect. The key is that the truth was revealed, and the narrator acted on their suspicions, even if indirectly."
