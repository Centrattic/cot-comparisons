It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend, Annie, who cheated on her husband Frank. The author, who's close to both, suggested a paternity test after feeling something was off, which led to Frank finding out the child wasn't his. Now, Annie is without income and a home, and the author is being criticized for causing the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author noticed something was wrong but didn't have proof. Cheating is a serious issue, and the author's suggestion of a paternity test, even if made after drinking, might have been a way to address the suspicion. But was it right for the author to bring up such a sensitive topic without being certain? Maybe the author overstepped by suggesting the test, but if they had a legitimate concern based on knowing Annie well, maybe they had good intentions.\n\nAnnie didn't directly admit to cheating, but the emotional cheating and the affair led to the child not being Frank's. The author's action led to Frank getting the truth, which might have been painful, but it also exposed the betrayal. However, the author's role in causing the breakup might be seen as negative. Frank is now isolated and moving away, and the author is blamed by family.\n\nThe question is whether the author should have stayed out of it. If Annie was being unfaithful and the author had a suspicion, maybe they had a right to help Frank uncover the truth. On the other hand, the author might have acted without knowing all the facts, and the suggestion could have been taken out of context. The fact that the comment stuck and led to the test suggests that the author's concern was valid, but the method of expressing it might have been inappropriate.\n\nAlso, considering the consequences: Annie is now facing financial hardship, which could be seen as a result of her actions. The author is being blamed for ruining the marriage, but was it really the author's fault if Annie was the one who cheated? The author might be a catalyst, but the root cause is Annie's infidelity.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help a friend (Frank) uncover the truth he needed to know. However, the author's approach could have been better. But given the outcome, some might argue the author should have kept quiet, especially if there wasn't concrete evidence. But others might see the author as supporting Frank in a tough situation, even if it caused a breakup.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer might depend on whether the author's actions were justified in exposing the cheating. If the author had no proof and just acted on a hunch, maybe they are in the wrong. But if they had enough reason to believe something was wrong, they might not be. Since the story says it was emotional cheating and the child wasn't his, Annie was at fault. The author's role was to support Frank, which could be seen as right. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
