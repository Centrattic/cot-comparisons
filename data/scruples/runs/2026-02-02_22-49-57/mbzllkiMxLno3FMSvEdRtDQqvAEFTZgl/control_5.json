It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves their sister-in-law Annie, who they've known since childhood. The writer's friend Frank, who is married to Annie, works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. Over three years, there were no direct admissions from Annie about cheating, but the writer had a suspicion. When Annie got pregnant, the writer suggested a paternity test after drinking, which led Frank to get one, revealing the child wasn't his. Now, Annie is without Frank's income and a home, and the writer is being blamed by family for causing the marriage breakdown. The writer feels Annie was at fault and is standing by their suggestion of the test.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the writer did something wrong. The key points are: the writer noticed something was off, suggested a paternity test indirectly, which Frank acted on. The test confirmed infidelity. The writer's family is upset because they think the writer shouldn't have said anything. The writer argues that Annie created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, did the writer overstep? The writer wasn't part of the marriage but was close to both. They had concerns but didn't have proof. The suggestion of a paternity test might have been a nudge for Frank to confront his suspicions. However, the test led to a public fallout, causing Annie to lose her support system. But Annie was cheating, which is a major betrayal. The writer's action revealed the truth, which Frank needed to know. However, the writer's role in prompting the test could be seen as meddling, especially if they weren't in a position to judge. But on the other hand, if the marriage was built on a lie, the truth needed to come out eventually. The writer's family is blaming them for the fallout, but Annie's actions were the root cause. The writer might have had the right to express their concerns, especially if they were close to both. But suggesting a paternity test in a casual conversation might have been inappropriate, as it's a serious accusation. However, given the circumstances, maybe it was a necessary step for Frank to take. The writer isn't necessarily in the wrong because the infidelity was Annie's fault. The writer's action led to the truth, which is the right thing in the long run. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
