It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where Annie had an affair and the baby isn't Frank's. The author suggested a paternity test, which led to the discovery.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's role was to suggest a paternity test after suspecting infidelity. Frank had a feeling his wife was cheating, and the author's suggestion led him to get the test. The test confirmed the baby wasn't his. Now, Annie is facing consequences, and the author is being blamed by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, the author was concerned about the situation and acted on a hunch. They weren't directly involved in the cheating; they were trying to help Frank uncover the truth. The author's intention might have been to protect Frank from being a father to someone else's child. However, the suggestion did lead to the breakdown of the marriage, which is why some might think the author is at fault.\n\nBut on the other hand, keeping the suggestion private might have allowed Frank to continue being deceived. The author's action led to the truth coming out, which is often seen as the right thing to do, even if it causes pain. The fact that Annie had an emotional affair and the child isn't Frank's suggests that she was the one who created the situation. The author's role was more of a catalyst for uncovering the truth rather than being the main wrongdoer.\n\nAlso, the author is being criticized by their own family, but their actions were based on concern for their friend. The fact that Frank is moving to another city to escape the fallout shows the family is more hostile towards Frank, possibly because they side with Annie. But ethically, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help expose infidelity and prevent Frank from being wronged further.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have approached it differently. Instead of suggesting a paternity test after drinking, maybe they should have confronted Annie first or given her a chance to explain. But given the circumstances, the author's intention was to help Frank, not to be malicious. So, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
