It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about Frank and Annie's marriage. The author is a close friend of Annie since childhood but also friends with Frank. The author didn't have direct evidence of Annie cheating but had a feeling. After Frank comes back from work and the baby is born, the author suggests a paternity test during a drunk conversation. Frank takes it seriously and the test shows he's not the father. Now Annie is left without her husband's income and home, and the author is being blamed by family for breaking up the marriage.\n\nFirst, the author's intention might have been to help Frank, but how did they approach it? The author mentions they felt Annie was emotionally cheating but didn't know for sure. The suggestion for a paternity test was made after a lot of alcohol, which might not have been the best approach. But maybe the author thought it was necessary to confirm Frank's suspicions.\n\nThen there's the aftermath. The author is blamed for ruining the marriage, but Annie was the one who cheated. The author argues that Annie created the situation, so they're not in the wrong. But did the author overstep by bringing up the paternity test? Maybe. Even if the author felt something was off, suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence could be seen as interfering. However, if Frank was already considering it, the author's comment might have just pushed him to take action.\n\nAlso, the moral aspect: is it right to support the cheated-on husband? Well, the author isn't the one who cheated, so their support is understandable. But the way they brought up the paternity test without being certain might be problematic. On the other hand, if the author didn't intervene, Annie might still be cheating and the child wouldn't have a real father. \n\nIt's a tough call. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because the cheating was Annie's fault. But the author's role in suggesting the test could have been handled differently. However, since the author was a friend and wanted to help, maybe they're not at fault. The family is blaming the author, but the main wrongdoer is Annie. So probably the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
