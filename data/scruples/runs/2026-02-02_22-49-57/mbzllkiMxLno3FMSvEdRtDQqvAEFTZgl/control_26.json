It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves their sister-like friend Annie, her husband Frank, and the poster who's supporting Frank after he found out Annie cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The poster knew Annie and Frank for a long time. Frank was away a lot for work. The poster had a feeling Annie was cheating but didn't have concrete evidence. When the couple announced a pregnancy, the poster suggested a paternity test during a conversation after drinking. The test confirmed the baby wasn't Frank's, and now the poster is facing backlash from family for causing the marriage to break down.\n\nThe main question is whether the poster is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The poster's intention was to voice their suspicion, which led to Frank getting a paternity test. Without the test, Frank might not have known about the infidelity. However, the test was suggested in a casual setting with alcohol involved, which might have influenced the situation.\n\nEthically, if Annie was cheating and the poster had a legitimate concern, pointing it out could be seen as helping Frank. But on the other hand, the poster might be overstepping by making such a suggestion without evidence, even if it was a hunch. It's possible that the poster didn't have the right to intervene in Frank's marriage unless they had a closer relationship.\n\nAlso, the poster's family is upset, saying they should have stayed silent. The poster's defense is that Annie was the one who created the situation by cheating, and using the child as an excuse is unfair. The poster now feels isolated along with Frank.\n\nIn terms of ethics and social norms, advising someone to get a paternity test is a serious step. If there's no proof, making such a suggestion might be seen as meddling. However, if the poster genuinely believed Annie was cheating and thought the test was necessary for Frank's peace of mind, they might feel justified.\n\nAnother angle is the consequence. The marriage ended, and the couple's lives were upended. The poster's action, even if well-intentioned, caused significant harm. But if Annie was indeed unfaithful, the truth might need to come out regardless of who prompted it.\n\nI should also consider the poster's relationship with both Frank and Annie. They've known both since childhood, so maybe they had a right to be concerned. However, the poster's role is that of a friend, not a counselor or authority figure. They might not have the expertise to handle such a sensitive issue.\n\nIn conclusion, there's a balance between helping a friend and overstepping. The poster might not be entirely in the wrong if the suspicion was valid, but the method of suggesting a paternity test in a casual, alcohol-fueled conversation could be problematic. However, since the test confirmed the infidelity, the outcome might support the poster's action. But the way it was handled might still be considered intrusive. So, the answer might depend on context not provided, like whether the poster had prior knowledge of the infidelity or just a feeling. Given the information, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they helped uncover the truth, but there's a case for A (in the wrong) for meddlesome behavior. But since the test revealed the truth, maybe B is more appropriate.\n"
