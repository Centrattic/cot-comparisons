It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong here. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage. The key points are:\n\nAnnie cheated on Frank, leading to the baby not being his. The author, who's close to Annie, suspected something but wasn't sure. When the couple announced a baby, the author, during a conversation with Frank after drinking, suggested a paternity test. That led to Frank getting the test, which proved he wasn't the father. Now, the author is getting criticized for breaking up the marriage and causing problems for Frank and the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author did something wrong. The author didn't know for sure Annie was cheating but had suspicions. By suggesting the paternity test, the author might have been trying to help Frank uncover the truth. However, the author wasn't in a position to intervene directly, given the distance and not being a family member. The question is whether the author overstepped by bringing up the paternity test idea, even if it was based on a hunch.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a concern and maybe wanted to protect Frank from being a father to someone else's child. On the other hand, the author was a friend, not a spouse, and inserting themselves into the marriage issues could be seen as meddling. The author's actions led to the marriage ending, which the family thinks they shouldn't have done. However, Annie was the one who cheated, so the author might argue they were just pointing out a possibility that Frank should consider.\n\nAlso, the author is now being blamed for the fallout, even though the cheating was Annie's fault. The author's intention was to help, but the method might have been inappropriate. However, if the author's suggestion led to the truth coming out, maybe it was necessary. The challenge is balancing the right to intervene versus respecting others' privacy.\n\nAnother angle: The author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. Acting on that could be seen as crossing a line. But if they had a close relationship with Frank, maybe they had the right to express concern. Also, Frank did end up taking the suggestion and getting the test, which revealed the infidelity. So the author's action, while possibly intrusive, led to Frank discovering the truth he needed to know.\n\nIn terms of ethics, encouraging someone to confirm their suspicions about a spouse's infidelity can be a sensitive issue. It's possible that the author didn't have the right to push for a paternity test without more evidence. However, given that the outcome revealed a betrayal, the author might be seen as helping Frank avoid being deceived further. The family's blame on the author is perhaps misplaced, as the root cause was Annie's actions.\n\nSo, the author's role is complex. They were a friend with a suspicion, who suggested a test that led to the truth. Whether they are in the wrong depends on whether their suggestion was justified. Since they had a long-standing relationship with both parties and the result was uncovering a betrayal, the author might not be in the wrong. However, they could have approached it differently, maybe discussing it with Annie first or being more discreet. Still, the main responsibility lies with Annie for her actions. The author's role was a catalyst, but not the root cause.\n"
