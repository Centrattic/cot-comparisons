It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister figure Annie, her husband Frank, and the author's role in uncovering the infidelity.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author, being close to Annie and Frank, had a feeling Annie was cheating. They live far away, so maybe they couldn't do much. Then, when Frank is about to become a father, the author jokingly suggests a paternity test after some drinks. Frank takes it seriously and later gets the test done, which reveals the child isn't his. Now, Annie is left without her husband's income and home, and the author is getting blamed by family for ruining the marriage. The author stands by their belief that Annie was at fault and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nSo, the author's actions led to the exposure of the cheating. But was it wrong? Let's consider the ethics here. The author didn't have direct proof but acted on suspicion. Suggesting a paternity test, even jokingly, might have been the catalyst. However, Frank chose to act on that suggestion. The author's intention might have been to protect Frank from being cheated on, but the method of doing so was through a casual comment. \n\nIs the author responsible for Frank's decision to get the test? Maybe not entirely, since Frank made the choice. However, the author's comment could be seen as crossing a boundary. Friends and family might have expected them to stay out of the marriage issues, especially from a distance. The author's concern for their friend might be genuine, but the way they handled it might have been impulsive. \n\nAlso, the aftermath: Annie is now in a difficult situation financially and socially. The author's family is upset, thinking they shouldn't have interfered. The author argues that Annie created the situation, but the child's well-being is being used against them. The author's stance is that Annie was the one who cheated, so the blame should be on her. However, the author's role in exposing the infidelity might have had unintended consequences, even if justified.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, it's a gray area. The author's intention was to help Frank, but the method might have been inappropriate. However, the cheating was on Annie's part, so the root cause is her actions. The author's comment was a catalyst but not the sole cause. So, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether their comment was a breach of trust or overstepping. Since they were close to Annie and Frank, maybe they felt entitled to speak up, but in hindsight, the situation could have been handled better. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author didn't act, Frank might never have known about the infidelity, which could lead to more long-term issues. But the method of revealing it through a paternity test might have been harsh. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to protect a friend, but their approach had negative side effects. Alternatively, they could be seen as overstepping by not being direct with Annie first or seeking more evidence before suggesting the test. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer hinges on whether the author had the right to intervene in that way. Since they were close and had a concern, maybe it's understandable, but the execution was flawed. However, the cheating was Annie's fault, so the main responsibility isn't on the author. Still, their actions did lead to the breakup, so some blame might be directed at them. But given the circumstances, the author's intent was to help, so they might not be entirely in the wrong.\n"
