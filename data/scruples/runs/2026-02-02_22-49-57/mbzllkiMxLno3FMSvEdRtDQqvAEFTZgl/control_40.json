It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank, Annie, and the writer. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the writer has a close relationship with Annie, almost like a sister. Frank and Annie got married, and Frank works in oil with a schedule that keeps him away for two weeks on and two off. The writer noticed signs that Annie might be cheating but couldn't do much because of the distance. When a baby was announced, the writer, after a few beers, suggested a paternity test. That suggestion stuck with Frank, leading him to push for the test, which revealed the baby wasn't his. Now, everyone is blaming the writer for ruining the marriage, and both the writer and Frank are isolated.\n\nSo the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. Let me consider the key points here. The writer had a feeling something was off but didn't have concrete evidence. They made a casual comment about a paternity test during a social gathering. Was that comment justified? Well, the writer might have felt concerned for Frank's sake, especially since Frank was away a lot. However, suggesting a paternity test without any proof could be seen as interfering. On the other hand, if Annie was indeed being unfaithful, maybe the comment was a way to address the issue.\n\nBut here's the thing: the writer didn't have any evidence, just a feeling. Maybe they overstepped by bringing up such a serious suggestion. However, the main catalyst for the test was the writer's comment. Even though Frank acted on it, the writer's words might have been the initial push. But does that make them at fault? Or is Frank responsible for not confronting the issue himself?\n\nAlso, the aftermath is that the writer is being blamed by their own family for \"ruining a good marriage.\" The writer argues that Annie created the situation, and using the child as an excuse is unfair. The writer is defending their stance, saying they were right to suspect something and suggest the test.\n\nI need to think about ethics here. Is it the writer's responsibility to intervene when they suspect infidelity? Or is it Frank's responsibility to address it directly? The writer might have acted out of concern but without evidence. It's a tricky situation. The writer's intention was to help Frank, but the method might have been inappropriate.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions versus consequences. The writer's intention was good, but the consequence was a broken marriage and isolation. However, if Annie was indeed cheating, maybe the test was necessary, and the writer's role was just the catalyst. The writer isn't directly responsible for Annie's actions, so they might not be in the wrong. But did they overstep by making that suggestion without talking to Frank privately first?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the writer did the right thing by encouraging Frank to verify the paternity, especially since he was away a lot. If the child isn't his, then it's a big deal. The writer's comment led to the truth coming out, which could be seen as the right outcome, even if it was uncomfortable. In that case, the writer isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help a friend.\n\nBut then again, maybe the writer shouldn't have brought it up without being sure. It's possible that Frank could have handled it himself if he had the suspicion. The writer's role as a friend might have crossed a line here. However, given the lack of evidence and the emotional cheating Frank mentioned later, maybe the writer's concern was somewhat valid.\n\nI think the key here is that the writer acted out of concern but without evidence. The community might split on this. However, since the writer's family is blaming them for the marriage's end, and the writer believes Annie was at fault, it's a matter of whether the writer's action was justified. The answer might lean towards B (No) because the writer's intention was to help, even if the method was a bit hasty. Alternatively, A (Yes) if they shouldn't have made that suggestion without talking to Frank first. But in AITA terms, often if someone acts out of good intentions, even if the outcome is bad, they're not the asshole. So probably B.\n"
