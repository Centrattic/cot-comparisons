It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank. The scenario involves the author, Frank, and Annie. The author suggests a paternity test to Frank, which leads to Frank finding out the baby isn't his. Now there's fallout, and the author is being criticized by family.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a close relationship with Annie, almost like a sister. Frank was in a marriage where Annie was cheating, but he didn't know. The author, living 1000 km away, had suspicions but couldn't do much. During a visit, after some drinks, the author suggests a paternity test. Frank later insists on getting one, which confirms the baby isn't his. The author's suggestion is cited as the reason for the marriage breakdown. Now the author is blamed by family for ruining the marriage, while they support Annie and the child.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants opinions. The choices are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects. The author had a suspicion that Annie might be cheating. Even though the author wasn't 100% sure, they made a suggestion in a casual setting. Was that overstepping? Also, the author's relationship with Annie is close, but the marriage is between Frank and Annie. The author's role here is a friend to both, but their suggestion led to the truth coming out.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a feeling something was off. Cheating is a serious issue, and Frank had every right to know if the child wasn't his. The author's intention might have been to help Frank get the truth, which is a valid concern. If Annie was cheating and having a child with someone else, Frank had a right to know, and the author's suggestion might have been a necessary step.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have the full context. They were living far away and based their suggestion on a feeling. If the author didn't have concrete evidence, maybe they shouldn't have pushed for a test. But Frank did later take action based on the suggestion. The author's role here is advisory, and if they had a good reason to suspect infidelity, their suggestion was well-intentioned.\n\nThe family is criticizing the author for ruining a marriage. But Annie was the one who cheated. The author isn't responsible for Annie's actions. The marriage was already in trouble because of her infidelity. The author's suggestion exposed the truth, which might have been necessary. Frank was the victim here, and the author helped him uncover the betrayal.\n\nHowever, the way the author approached it\u2014casually during drinks\u2014might have been inappropriate. But the suggestion itself was valid. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting Frank to know the truth. The real issue is Annie's infidelity and the consequences of that. The author's actions led to the truth, which is not something to be blamed for. The author isn't responsible for the fallout from the cheating; Annie is.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
