It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Frank and Annie. The author, who's close to Annie like a sister, found out that Frank might have been cheated on. The key points here are that Annie didn't explicitly tell Frank about her infidelity, and the author suggested a paternity test after some beers. That led to Frank finding out the baby wasn't his. Now he's upset, and the author is being blamed by family for causing the breakup.\n\nFirst, the author's role here. They mentioned the paternity test idea, but it was during a drunken conversation. The user is asking if that's wrong. Well, if the author had a suspicion based on their long-term relationship with Annie and Frank, maybe they felt responsible. But did they have enough proof? The story says Annie never directly admitted cheating; it was just a feeling. So the author acted on a hunch, which might not be justified.\n\nNext, the consequences. The marriage fell apart, Frank lost his income and home. The author is getting blamed by family for not staying out of it. But the author argues Annie was the one who created the situation. The question is whether the author overstepped by bringing up the paternity test. Even if they thought they were helping, acting on suspicion without evidence could be problematic. Maybe Frank should have addressed the issue himself, but the author pushed him to a paternity test. That might have been a heavy move without clear proof.\n\nAlso, the author's parents and siblings are saying they should have kept quiet. Is that a valid point? If the author didn't have concrete evidence, suggesting a test could be seen as interfering. On the other hand, if they had a reason to believe something was wrong, maybe they had concerns for Frank. But the way it happened\u2014during a drunken conversation\u2014might not be the best approach.\n\nThe author's motivation is important. Were they trying to help Frank? They thought Annie was being unfaithful, but without her admitting it, maybe the author's own assumptions led to the problem. The emotional cheating part is mentioned, but not the physical. So the paternity result being negative might be due to physical infidelity. But the author's suggestion led to the test, which caused the marriage to end.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might share some blame for pushing Frank to take action based on suspicion. However, if Annie was indeed cheating, then she's the main person at fault. The author's action was a catalyst, but the underlying issue was the marriage's integrity. So is the author in the wrong? They might not be entirely, as the core issue was Annie's actions. But maybe the author shouldn't have meddled without more evidence. Alternatively, they were trying to protect their friend Frank from being a father to someone else's child. It's a tough call. The answer could hinge on whether the author had a right to intervene or if they overstepped. Since the story is from the author's perspective, they feel justified, but others see them as the cause. In such cases, sometimes the person who brings up the issue is seen as problematic even if the truth is worse. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they acted on suspicion without proof, leading to the breakdown. But there's a counterargument that they were trying to help. However, the consensus might be that the author did wrong by not letting Frank handle it himself. So I'm leaning towards A.\n"
