It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author supporting a husband, Frank, who was cheated on by his wife Annie. The author found out that Annie had an affair and that the baby isn't Frank's. The author suggested a paternity test after drinking, which led to the discovery and the marriage breaking down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's relationship with Annie is like a sister, and they've known each other since birth. The author felt something was off but couldn't do much from afar. Then they made a comment about a paternity test while drunk, which Frank took seriously. The author defends their actions, saying Annie created the situation and that using the child as an argument is unfair.\n\nNow, the author is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage. They're sticking to their belief that Annie was at fault. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the author didn't have concrete evidence of cheating, just a feeling. Suggesting a paternity test, even if offhandedly, might have been a harsh way to approach it, especially after drinking. But the author's intention might have been to help Frank ensure the child is his, given the circumstances of Frank's work schedule which could make it harder to notice infidelity. \n\nOn the other hand, the author wasn't in a position to know the full story. Maybe Annie had reasons for the affair, but the author's action led to the marriage's collapse. However, if Annie was emotionally cheating and the baby isn't Frank's, then the author's suggestion might have been the right call to uncover the truth. \n\nBut the problem here is whether the author overstepped. They weren't a spouse, just a close friend. Maybe they had the right intentions but handled it poorly. However, the fact that Frank acted on the suggestion and the marriage ended as a result complicates things. \n\nThe author's family is blaming them, but the author believes Annie was at fault. The key is whether the author's suggestion was an overreach. Since the author's concern was about paternity and the marriage's integrity, maybe they weren't in the wrong, especially considering the baby isn't Frank's. But if they didn't have evidence and just a feeling, maybe they shouldn't have brought it up. \n\nIn the end, it's a tough call. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank ensure the child's paternity, which is a valid concern. However, the manner in which it was done (after drinking and without proof) might have been careless. Still, given the outcome, the author might not be at fault since the cheating was real, and the child isn't Frank's. So the answer might be B (No), as the author's intention was to uncover the truth, and the fault lies more with Annie.\n"
