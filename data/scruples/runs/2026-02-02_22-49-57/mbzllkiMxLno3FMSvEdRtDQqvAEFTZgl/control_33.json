It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend's sister, Annie, who cheated on her husband Frank. The author, who's close to Annie like a sister, suggested a paternity test after suspecting something, which led to Frank finding out the child wasn't his. Now the author is being criticized for causing the breakdown of the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a feeling Annie was cheating but didn't have direct evidence. Frank was working in a job that kept him away for two weeks at a time, which might have made it easier for Annie to cheat. The author mentioned the paternity test idea while they were drunk, which Frank later took seriously. The result showed the child wasn't his, so Frank left Annie, and now the author is getting flak for it. The question is whether the author is wrong for supporting Frank in getting the test.\n\nSo, the author's intent was to help Frank ensure the child was his. Without direct evidence, the author went on a hunch. But maybe the author overstepped by suggesting the test, especially without concrete proof. However, if Annie was indeed cheating, then the author might have been trying to do the right thing. But did the author have the right to intervene like that?\n\nOn the other hand, Frank might have handled it differently if he hadn't been influenced by the author's suggestion. But if the marriage was already strained due to infidelity, perhaps the test was inevitable. The author's parents and siblings think they should have stayed out of it, which is a common reaction when someone meddles in others' relationships.\n\nThe author argues that Annie created the situation, so they're not wrong. The child being used as a shield is a point too\u2014maybe the focus should be on Annie's actions. But legally and morally, suggesting a paternity test isn't inherently wrong if there's a reasonable suspicion. However, without explicit proof, the author might have acted impulsively.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author had a right to intervene. Since they were close friends, maybe they thought they were helping. But relationships are private, and even if the suspicion was there, the author's role was to support Frank, not push for confrontation. However, if the author didn't know for sure and just had a feeling, maybe they shouldn't have pushed the test. It's a tough call. But the answer depends on whether the author's action was justified. If the suspicion was a hunch, maybe they were wrong to act on it. But if Annie's cheating was obvious, then maybe not. Since the story says Annie never directly admitted to cheating, just the author's feeling, the author might have acted on incomplete info. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they acted on suspicion without proof and caused the breakup. But others might say that if the husband was being deceived, it's better to uncover the truth. Hmm. It's a bit of a gray area. But since the author's suggestion led directly to the paternity test and the marriage's end, even without proof, the author could be seen as overstepping. So maybe answer A.\n"
