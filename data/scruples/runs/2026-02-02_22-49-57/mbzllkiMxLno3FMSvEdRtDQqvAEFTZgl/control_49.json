It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about Frank and Annie's marriage. The author, who's close to Annie like a sister, suspected Annie was cheating because Frank was away a lot. Then when Frank found out the baby wasn't his, the author suggested a paternity test. Now, Frank and the author are being shunned by their families.\n\nFirst, the author's parents and siblings think the author shouldn't have said anything. The question is whether the author is wrong for supporting Frank by suggesting the test. \n\nFrom what I read, Annie had been cheating emotionally and the baby isn't Frank's. The author had a suspicion but didn't have proof. By suggesting the paternity test, the author might have helped Frank uncover the truth. But maybe the author overstepped by making the comment when they were drunk. However, the author didn't know for sure, just a feeling. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's family is criticizing them for ruining the marriage. But Annie was the one who was unfaithful. The author's intention was to help Frank get the truth, which is important for the marriage. However, the way it was brought up might have been inappropriate. \n\nBut considering the outcome, Annie is left without financial support and Frank is moving away. The author's family is blaming them, but perhaps the author isn't to blame since the cheating was Annie's fault. The author didn't force Frank to do the test, just suggested it. So the responsibility lies more with Annie for the cheating. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank get the truth, even if it led to the breakup. The main issue was Annie's infidelity. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
