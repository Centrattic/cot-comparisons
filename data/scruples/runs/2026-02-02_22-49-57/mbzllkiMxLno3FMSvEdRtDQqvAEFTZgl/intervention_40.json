It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. So, the author, let's call them Person X, has known Annie and Frank since they were kids. Annie married Frank, and Person X is close to Annie, almost like a sister. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. Over three years of marriage, Annie never directly admitted to cheating, but Person X had a feeling. Then, when they found out Annie was pregnant, Person X, after some drinks, suggested Frank consider a paternity test. That comment stuck, Frank insisted on a test, and it turned out the baby wasn't his. He also revealed it was the author's suggestion, which caused a lot of fallout.\n\nNow, the author is getting blamed by family for ruining the marriage. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's intent. They had a suspicion that Annie was cheating but didn't have concrete evidence. They weren't directly told, so it was more of a feeling. The author's comment was made after drinking, which might have been a slip or a moment of honesty. But suggesting a paternity test is a big deal. Even if the author thought it was for Frank's benefit, the way they approached it could be problematic. Maybe Frank took it as judgmental or accusatory, especially since there was no direct evidence from Annie.\n\nThen, the consequences. The marriage ended, Annie is now without financial support and a home, moving back in with parents. Frank is isolated and relocating. The author is also isolated from friends and family. The author is defending themselves by saying Annie created the situation and it's unfair to use the child as a card. But the key here is whether the author's actions were justified.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the author had no proof and was just acting on a suspicion, maybe they overstepped. Even if they meant well, inserting themselves into someone else's relationship without solid evidence can be seen as meddling. However, if they had a strong suspicion and were trying to prevent a larger issue (like raising a child that's not Frank's), perhaps their intent is understandable. But the method of bringing it up after drinking might have been unwise.\n\nAlso, the fact that Frank later insisted on a paternity test suggests that he might have had his own doubts. The author's comment might have just pushed him to take action he was already considering. In that case, maybe the author's role was more of a catalyst than the sole cause. However, the author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage, which could be harsh if Frank was already on the verge of finding out the truth.\n\nAnother angle: the author is a close friend, so maybe they felt responsible to speak up. But relationships are private, and even close friends might not have the right to interject without being asked. The author might have thought they were helping, but in reality, they caused a breakup that could have been avoided if Frank had handled it himself.\n\nOn the other hand, if Annie was emotionally cheating and the child isn't Frank's, maybe the marriage was already in trouble. The author's suggestion, while perhaps tactless, might have led to necessary consequences. But the author's responsibility here is tricky. They didn't know for sure, just had a feeling. So, is it their fault for acting on a suspicion, or is it Frank's for not addressing the situation sooner?\n\nAlso, the author is being criticized for not staying quiet, but the family is using the child as an argument. If the child is not Frank's, then Frank isn't the biological father. However, once the paternity is known, the responsibility for the child's upbringing becomes a separate issue. The author isn't the parent, so maybe they aren't responsible for the child's situation, but they might be partially responsible for the marriage's collapse.\n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong because they acted on a suspicion without evidence and in a way that led to the breakdown of the marriage. However, if the marriage was already in trouble, their role might be less blameworthy. The key is whether the author's actions were a necessary intervention or an overreach. Since the author had no proof and the situation was sensitive, they might have overstepped, making them partly at fault. But if the marriage was already on shaky ground, maybe the outcome was inevitable. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they initiated the suggestion that led to the breakup without solid evidence.\n"
