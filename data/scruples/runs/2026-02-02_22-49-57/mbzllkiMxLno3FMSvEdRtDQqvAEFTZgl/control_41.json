It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where the author (let's call them Alex) supported Frank after discovering Annie cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. Alex has a close relationship with Annie, almost like a sister. Frank is in a marriage with Annie, and he works in a job that keeps him away for two weeks at a time. Over three years, Annie never directly admitted to cheating but there were suspicions. Alex suggests a paternity test after some drinking, which leads Frank to get the test. The baby isn't his, and Annie emotionally cheated. Now, Frank is cutting ties, and Alex is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage. Alex feels Annie is at fault, not them.\n\nSo the question is whether Alex is wrong for supporting Frank and bringing up the paternity test. Let me think about the key points here. \n\nFirst, the suggestion of a paternity test. Alex made this comment while drunk, but it's unclear if they had any concrete evidence. Cheating is a serious issue, but emotional cheating is different from physical infidelity. However, if there were signs and suspicions, maybe Frank had reasons to be concerned. \n\nBut did Alex overstep by suggesting the test? They weren't in a position to know for sure, and Annie wasn't openly cheating. Maybe they acted on a hunch without proof, which could be seen as meddling. However, their intention was to help Frank uncover the truth, which he later acted on. \n\nNow, the aftermath: Annie is now in a worse position financially and socially. Alex is being criticized for causing the breakup. The family thinks Alex should've stayed silent. But Alex argues that Annie created the situation. \n\nEthically, is it wrong to suggest a paternity test if you suspect infidelity? If there's no proof, maybe it's crossing a line. However, in a close-knit family where Annie was like a sister, maybe Alex felt compelled to act. \n\nAlso, the emotional cheating aspect. Emotional cheating can be as damaging as physical infidelity, though it's not the same as an affair. But if Annie was emotionally involved with someone else, that's her responsibility. \n\nThe key issue here is whether Alex had the right to intervene. They weren't part of the marriage, so their role was as a friend. However, by suggesting the test, even if it led to the truth, they might have caused harm. \n\nBut if the marriage was already strained and Annie was cheating, maybe Frank needed to know. Alex's comment might have been the catalyst for Frank to take action, which he might have done eventually anyway. \n\nSo, is Alex in the wrong? If there was no evidence, maybe they shouldn't have brought it up. But if Frank was already suspicious, maybe the suggestion was just a push. \n\nAnother angle: the child. If the baby isn't Frank's, he's not the biological father. That's a big deal, and Annie keeping that secret is definitely wrong. But Alex's role in suggesting the test might have led to that revelation. \n\nHowever, the family is blaming Alex for the fallout. But Annie's actions are the root cause. Alex might not be wrong for supporting Frank in seeking the truth. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes the person who brings up the truth is seen as the right person, even if it causes conflict. So maybe Alex isn't in the wrong here. \n\nBut then again, if there was no proof, the suggestion could be seen as a betrayal of trust towards Annie. So it's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nGiven that the author's intention was to help Frank, and Annie's actions were the real problem, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They acted out of concern for their friend and the truth came out, even if it caused a mess.\n"
