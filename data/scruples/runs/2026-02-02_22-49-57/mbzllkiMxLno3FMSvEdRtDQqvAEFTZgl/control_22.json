It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author (let's call them Person X) is friends with Annie and Frank. Frank was married to Annie, who cheated, leading to the baby not being his. Person X suggested a paternity test, which led to Frank finding out. Now Person X is getting blamed for ruining the marriage, and they're defending their actions, saying Annie was at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the elements of the story. Person X noticed something off, maybe suspected infidelity but wasn't sure. They weren't directly told, just had a feeling. Then, when the baby came along, they made a joke or comment about a paternity test during a drunk conversation. The comment stuck, leading Frank to get the test, which confirmed his fears. The result was the breakup, and now Person X is being criticized for speaking up.\n\nSo, the key points are: Was Person X justified in bringing up the paternity test? Did they overstep? The question is whether they are in the wrong. On one hand, they might have been trying to help Frank by pointing out a possibility that his instincts were right. On the other hand, suggesting a paternity test is a serious accusation, even if it's just a suggestion. But since Annie was cheating, maybe the suggestion was valid. However, the method might be questionable. Maybe Person X shouldn't have brought it up without more evidence, but they did say it was after a lot of beers, so maybe not serious. But it still led to action.\n\nThe other angle is that Person X was a close friend to both, so maybe they had the right to express concern. However, the problem is that they ended up causing the breakup, which affected many people. But Annie was the one who cheated. So the responsibility lies more on her. Person X might have just been the catalyst. Also, the friends and family are blaming Person X, but maybe they're not wrong. The question is whether the suggestion was inappropriate. Since Person X had a long-term friendship with both, perhaps they had the right to voice their suspicion, especially if they had been feeling something was off for a while.\n\nBut suggesting a paternity test is a big step. Even if you suspect something, bringing up such a sensitive issue, even in a joking manner, could be seen as intrusive. However, given that Annie's actions led to the situation, maybe Person X isn't entirely at fault. The answer might depend on whether the suggestion was reasonable given the circumstances. Since Frank later took the suggestion seriously and acted on it, maybe Person X's role was just a part of the unfolding events. The main wrongdoer here is Annie for cheating. So, Person X might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank see the truth, even if their method was a bit hasty.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Person X should have kept quiet unless they were sure. But they had a suspicion based on Annie's behavior over three years. So maybe it's not their fault. The answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Because the cheating spouse is the main issue, and the suggestion led to the truth coming out, which is ultimately the right thing, even if it's painful.\n"
