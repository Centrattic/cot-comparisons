It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband after suggesting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, the situation: Frank and Annie are married. Frank is away a lot for work. The author, a close friend of Annie, suspects something. After a conversation during a visit where the author suggests a paternity test, Frank gets one done and finds out the baby isn't his. The author is now being blamed by family for ruining the marriage. The author feels Annie was at fault, and they stick by Frank despite being ostracized.\n\nSo, the main points here are: Did the author overstep by bringing up the paternity test? Was the suggestion justified? The author had known Annie since childhood and felt something was off. They were concerned enough to mention it, even if it was after drinking. The result confirmed the suspicion, so maybe the author was right to act on it.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author wasn't directly involved in the marriage, just a friend. They might have assumed the worst without clear evidence. However, the test revealed the truth, which shows there was an issue. The author's intention was to help Frank, even if it was a tough situation.\n\nThe family is blaming the author for causing the fallout. But Annie was the one who cheated, so maybe the author did the right thing by supporting Frank. The author's actions led to the truth coming out, which is usually seen as just. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they acted on a valid concern, which was later proven correct. Cheating is a serious issue, and the author's suggestion helped Frank realize the betrayal. The family's reaction might be harsh, but the author's intent was to support Frank, not to meddle. So the answer is B.\n"
