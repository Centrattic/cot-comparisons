It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The user is asking about a scenario where they supported a husband who found out his wife cheated, leading to the end of the marriage. The author is being criticized by family for suggesting a paternity test, which ultimately revealed the child wasn't the husband's.\n\nFirst, let's look at the facts. The author knew Annie since childhood and was like a sister. Frank and Annie were married, with Frank in the oil industry working long shifts. The author noticed something off but couldn't act on it from afar. Then, when the pregnancy happened, the author, after some drinks, suggested a paternity test. This led Frank to get one, which confirmed infidelity. Now, the author is being blamed for ruining the marriage and is isolated.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's suggestion led to the paternity test, which exposed the cheating. The author's family is upset, saying they should have stayed silent. The author feels Annie created the situation and that using the child as an argument is unfair. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know the perspective here.\n\nNow, considering the right and wrong. Did the author have a right to suggest the test? The author noticed something was off but couldn't act before. When the pregnancy happened, they made a comment. But was that comment overstepping? Frank was the one who later insisted on the test. So the author's comment might have planted a seed, but Frank made the decision. However, the author's suggestion was a direct nudge towards a test. \n\nBut infidelity is a serious issue. If Annie was cheating, then the marriage was already compromised. The author's intention was to help Frank get the truth, which he did. But the method\u2014suggesting a test after drinking\u2014might have been careless. However, the test was the husband's choice. So maybe the author isn't at fault because the truth needed to come out, and Frank was the one who took action. The author is being blamed for speaking up, but if Annie was cheating, maybe the author did the right thing. However, the emotional aspect of the child is being used against the author. But the child's existence was a result of the cheating, so it's Annie's responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have all the facts. Maybe Annie was being emotionally unfaithful but not physically, so the paternity test was unnecessary. But the test showed the child wasn't Frank's, so the cheating was physical. The author's role was to point out concerns, which led to the truth. So in that case, the author isn't in the wrong. The family's criticism is misplaced because they're protecting the cheater. However, the author could have handled it more delicately. But overall, the truth came out, and the author was just a catalyst. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
