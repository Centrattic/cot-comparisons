It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about Frank and Annie. The author is friends with both, and Annie cheated on Frank. The key point is that the author suggested a paternity test after getting the idea that the baby might not be Frank's. The test confirmed it wasn't his, leading to the breakup and Frank finding out Annie was emotionally cheating too.\n\nThe author is being blamed by his family for ruining the marriage. He's supporting Frank despite the backlash. Now, the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let me break down the facts. The author didn't know for sure about the infidelity, just had a feeling. He was drunk when he suggested the paternity test, but his comment stuck. Frank decided to get the test after that. The test proved the child wasn't his. The author argues that Annie created the situation, so he's not to blame. Others are saying he should have kept quiet and that Frank is being immature.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, suggesting a paternity test is a serious thing. Even if he had suspicions, bringing it up in a drunken conversation might have been unwise. However, if Annie was cheating and creating a situation where Frank was being deceived, maybe the author was trying to help. But the problem is that the author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. By suggesting the test, he might have overstepped his bounds. He wasn't in a position to interfere in their marriage, especially since he wasn't a party to it. \n\nOn the other hand, he was close to both and maybe felt compelled to speak up. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he didn't have proof, suggesting a test could be seen as meddling. However, if his intention was to help Frank, maybe he's not wrong. The key is whether he had the right to interfere. Since he was a friend and not a family member, perhaps it's not his role to do so. Therefore, maybe he's at fault for inserting himself into their private matter without knowing for sure. But then again, if he had a legitimate concern, maybe he's justified. The answer might depend on whether his action was an overreach or necessary. I'm a bit torn here but leaning towards A (Yes, he's wrong) because he acted on a suspicion without evidence, causing harm. However, if he was trying to prevent Frank from being wronged, maybe he's not. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B (No) because Annie was cheating, and the author was trying to protect his friend. But I'm not sure. The line between helping and interfering is blurry here.\n"
