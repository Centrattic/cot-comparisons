It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage where Annie cheated, leading to the baby not being Frank's. The author, who's close to both, suggested a paternity test which led to the discovery and the fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a close relationship with both parties and had a feeling something was off. They were 1000 km away, so maybe they didn't have direct evidence. The suggestion of a paternity test was made after some alcohol, but it was just enough to prompt Frank to take action. Now, the author is being blamed for ruining the marriage and is isolated. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants others' opinions.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault. Let's think about the intent. The author's intention was to help Frank ensure the baby was his. Even if it wasn't the best timing (after drinking), the underlying concern was valid. However, the author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. They might have overstepped by bringing it up, especially if Annie wasn't directly accusing Frank of being cheated on. \n\nAnnie's actions are clearly wrong. Cheating and having a child with someone else is a major betrayal. The author's role here is complicated. While they acted out of concern for Frank, their suggestion led to the breakup, which affects many people. The author might be seen as meddling, even if their intentions were good. \n\nHowever, in some contexts, if you know someone is being cheated on, even without proof, suggesting a paternity test isn't entirely wrong. It's a way to confirm the truth. The problem is that the author didn't have proof and acted on a suspicion. That could be seen as interfering. But considering the outcome (the truth came out), maybe the right decision was made regardless of the method.\n\nThe family is blaming the author for ruining the marriage, which is harsh because the root cause was Annie's infidelity. The author's suggestion was a catalyst, but the marriage was already strained due to the cheating. So, the author's role is more of an enabler in uncovering the truth rather than the main cause of the marriage's collapse.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to support Frank. However, they should have approached the situation more carefully, maybe gathering more evidence or discussing it with Frank in a sober state. But since the test led to the truth and Frank chose to leave, the author's action had a purpose. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author had no right to intervene in their personal matters without being certain, then they might be at fault. But given the close relationship and the potential consequences (raising a child that isn't Frank's), the author's concern is understandable.\n\nSo, weighing all factors, the author's intention was positive, even if the method was questionable. The main wrongdoing was Annie's, and the author's action, while it caused immediate conflict, ultimately revealed the truth. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
