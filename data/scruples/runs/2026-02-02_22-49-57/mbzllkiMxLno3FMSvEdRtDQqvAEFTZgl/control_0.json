It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA story) is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister-figure Annie, who they believe was cheating on Frank, leading to a paternity test that revealed Frank isn't the father. The author suggested the test, which led to the marriage falling apart. Now, they're getting criticism from family, and the question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has a close relationship with Annie, like a sister. They noticed something off and, after some time, brought up the paternity test idea while they were drunk. Frank took it seriously, did the test, and it turned out the kid isn't his. The author is being blamed for ruining the marriage, but they think Annie was the one who created the situation.\n\nThe main points to analyze are: Did the author overstep by suggesting the test? Was there enough evidence to warrant that? The author had a feeling but no proof. Annie never admitted to cheating. The author's intention was to help Frank confirm his suspicions, which he acted on. But by doing so, they caused a breakdown in the marriage and family conflicts.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if there's no concrete evidence of infidelity, bringing up such a sensitive issue (like a paternity test) can be seen as harmful. The author might have acted on a suspicion without knowing the full story. Even if they thought they were helping, the consequences were severe. However, Frank chose to act on the suggestion and the test result, which is his choice. The author's role is more of a catalyst here. But did they have the right to intervene in such a personal matter without knowing all the facts?\n\nAlso, the author is now isolated and being criticized. The family thinks they should have stayed silent. The argument here is whether the author had the right to interfere in the first place. If the author's intention was to help Frank, but the method was inappropriate, then maybe they are partially at fault. However, if the suspicion was there and Frank took action, it's possible the marriage was already in trouble. The author might not be entirely wrong, but they did contribute to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of relationship advice, usually, you don't meddle in someone else's marriage unless there's clear evidence. The author's suggestion, even if well-intentioned, might have crossed a line. So, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they acted on a hunch without proof, leading to the marriage's collapse. However, since Frank decided to take the test and end the marriage, the responsibility isn't solely on the author. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that they suggested a paternity test based on a feeling, which is a very sensitive and irreversible action, it's possible the answer is A. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to help. It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the author overstepped, making them at least partially responsible."
