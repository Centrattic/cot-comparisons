It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank.\n\nThe author's story is about their friend Annie, who married Frank. Frank works in oil, so he's away for two weeks and then has two weeks off. The author noticed that Annie might have been seeing someone else, but there was no direct evidence. The author then, during a visit, suggested a paternity test to Frank after drinking. Frank ended up getting the test, which confirmed the baby wasn't his. The author is now getting criticized for ruining the marriage and causing Annie to lose her financial support and home. The author stands by their decision, thinking Annie was at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are the author's role in suggesting the paternity test. The author wasn't directly accusing Annie but mentioned the possibility. However, this was under the influence of alcohol, which might have affected the appropriateness of the suggestion. \n\nBut wait, the author's intention might have been to help Frank uncover the truth. If Annie was indeed cheating and the child isn't Frank's, then the paternity test was necessary for Frank to know the truth. However, the author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. Introducing such a suggestion, even if it's true, could be seen as interfering in a personal matter without being directly asked. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern might have been genuine, given their long-standing relationship with both parties. The fact that Frank later decided on his own to get a paternity test suggests that the idea came from him, not just the author's suggestion. The author's comment might have prompted Frank to take action, but ultimately, the decision was Frank's. \n\nThe criticism from family towards the author is based on the idea that the author shouldn't have meddled. However, if Annie was unfaithful and the child isn't Frank's, then the author's intervention could be seen as justified. The question is whether the author overstepped by suggesting the test without clear evidence. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, it's possible that the author did the right thing by encouraging Frank to verify the paternity, especially if there were signs of infidelity. However, the method might have been inappropriate. The author might not be entirely at fault because the decision to get the test was ultimately Frank's. \n\nBut maybe the author shouldn't have brought it up in that context, especially while drinking. The line between helping a friend and interfering in their relationship can be blurry. The author's long-term friendship with Annie might mean they had a duty to be honest if they suspected infidelity, but that doesn't necessarily mean they had the right to push Frank for a test. \n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might have been good, suggesting a paternity test based on a feeling, even if true, without concrete evidence could be considered interfering. However, since the decision to get the test was Frank's, the author's role might not be the main issue. The key is whether the author acted responsibly in their suggestion. Given the circumstances, it's a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the truth was ultimately uncovered, and Annie was the one who was unfaithful.\n"
