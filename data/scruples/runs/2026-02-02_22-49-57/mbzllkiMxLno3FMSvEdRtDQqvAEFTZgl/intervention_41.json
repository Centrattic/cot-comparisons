It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, by suggesting a paternity test. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has a close relationship with Annie, who is like a sister. Annie married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. During their marriage, the author sensed something was off but couldn't do much from afar. When Frank and Annie announced a pregnancy, the author, after some drinks, suggested a paternity test. Frank later insisted on getting one, which revealed the baby wasn't his. The author is now being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage, while Frank is moving away and both are isolated.\n\nThe author's stance is that Annie created the situation and using the child as an excuse is unfair. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for bringing up the paternity test.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's intent and the consequences. The author was concerned about Frank being cheated on, possibly emotionally, and wanted to ensure the child was his. But the author's suggestion led to the test, which exposed the infidelity. The family is upset because they think the author shouldn't have interfered.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if Annie was indeed cheating, then the author might be helping Frank uncover the truth. However, the author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. Suggesting a paternity test without proof could be seen as a harsh action, especially if it's a false accusation. On the other hand, if Frank was being honest and the author was protecting him from a possible bigger betrayal, maybe it's justified.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions Frank caught her emotional cheating. So maybe the author's intuition was correct. However, the way the author approached it\u2014after drinking and making a comment\u2014might have been unwise. The author's suggestion might have been the catalyst for Frank to take action, which led to the breakdown. Even if the concern was valid, the method of suggesting it in a casual setting could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the author's family is criticizing them for causing the marriage to fall apart, which adds complexity. The author might have overstepped by inserting themselves into the situation without being directly asked. Even if the motivation was good, the action could be seen as interfering in a private matter.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. But considering that the author had a close relationship with Annie and Frank, and their intention was to help Frank verify paternity (which he later did), maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. However, the method of bringing it up and the resulting fallout could mean some responsibility. But since the outcome was the truth coming out, which is usually the right thing, the author might not be in the wrong. Still, it's a tough call because personal relationships and boundaries are involved. The answer might hinge on whether the author overstepped by making the suggestion without being asked.\n"
