It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's sister-in-law, Annie, who's married to Frank, and the author believes Annie was cheating. The author suggested a paternity test to Frank, which revealed the kid wasn't his. Now the author is getting criticized for causing the breakup and Frank's current situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author's relationship with Annie is close, like a sister. Frank works in a job with long shifts, so maybe he's away a lot, which could contribute to the marriage issues. The author had a feeling something was off but didn't have direct proof. They suggested a paternity test when visiting, which led to Frank getting the test. The result confirmed the suspicion, causing the marriage to end. The author is now blamed for ruining the marriage and is facing backlash from family.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. Did the author have the right to intervene? The author might have thought they were helping Frank by voicing their concern, especially if they noticed signs of infidelity. However, without concrete evidence, suggesting such a sensitive action as a paternity test could be seen as overstepping. The author's intention might have been good, but the method could be questionable. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author genuinely believed there was a possibility of infidelity and trusted Frank's judgment to act on it, maybe it's not entirely their fault. But the fact that they made a suggestion that led to a test without Annie's consent or direct proof might make them responsible. Also, the author's comment during a drunk conversation might not have been well-considered, leading to unintended consequences.\n\nAnother angle: the author's family is criticizing them for ruining the marriage. But Annie's actions (cheating and having a child with another man) are the root cause. The author is being blamed for exposing the truth. However, by exposing the cheating, the author might have caused the breakdown of the marriage. But is the author responsible for the consequences of the truth coming out? Or is Annie and Frank's marital issues their own problem?\n\nAlso, the author is being told to think about the child. But if the child is not Frank's, maybe it's better for the child's well-being to have the truth known, even if it's uncomfortable. However, the author's role in revealing this might have caused Frank's sudden lack of income and housing, which is a difficult situation. But Frank and Annie's decisions led to that outcome. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might have overstepped by suggesting the test. They didn't have direct evidence, just a feeling. The author's relationship with Annie is close, so maybe they had a responsibility to speak up, but perhaps they should have approached it differently. Alternatively, maybe it's none of their business, and they shouldn't have intervened.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intention, their relationship with both parties, and the impact of their actions. If the author acted out of concern and believed they were protecting Frank from being deceived, maybe they're in the right. However, if they acted without sufficient reason and caused unnecessary harm, they might be at fault.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the author had the right to intervene in someone else's marriage. Since they were close to both parties and had a suspicion, but not proof, their suggestion could be seen as meddling. However, the outcome revealed a betrayal that Frank might not have been aware of. The author's action led to the truth but caused significant disruption. \n\nI think the author might be partially responsible for how they approached the situation, but the main fault lies with Annie for cheating. The author's role in exposing the infidelity is a gray area. Depending on the cultural or moral standpoint, people might view the author as right for helping Frank discover the truth or wrong for interfering. \n\nIn the end, since the question is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer could be either way. However, given that the author acted on a suspicion without proof and caused the breakup, they might be partially at fault. But considering the context of a close friendship and the eventual truth coming out, it's a tough call. I'm leaning towards not in the wrong (B) because they were trying to help Frank, but others might see it as meddling (A). But based on typical AITA scenarios, sometimes the person who exposes infidelity isn't the asshole, even if it causes fallout.\n"
