It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister-figure Annie marrying Frank, who's in the oil industry with a work schedule that keeps him away for two weeks at a time. The author suspects Annie of cheating but never gets a direct confirmation. Then, when Annie and Frank have a baby, the author, after a few beers, suggests a paternity test. Frank takes that suggestion seriously, and the test reveals the baby isn't his. The author ends up being blamed by family members for ruining the marriage, and now both the author and Frank are isolated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They made a comment about the paternity test during a casual conversation. But the key point here is that the author didn't know for sure that Annie had cheated; they just had a feeling. The suggestion was made in a relaxed, possibly less inhibited setting. The author didn't have concrete evidence, so their comment was based on suspicion. \n\nNow, the question is whether that comment crosses the line. On one hand, suggesting a paternity test without evidence might seem like an accusation. But on the other hand, the author had a close relationship with both parties, which might give them some leeway to express concerns. However, even close relationships have boundaries. Bringing up such a sensitive topic without solid proof could be seen as invasive.\n\nFrank later acting on that comment led to the breakdown of the marriage. The author might argue that they were only pointing out a suspicion they had for years, and Frank's decision to act on it was his own. The author's intent wasn't to cause harm but to raise a concern. However, the impact was significant, leading to Annie losing her financial stability and Frank being isolated.\n\nFamily is blaming the author for overstepping. The author's defense is that Annie created the situation through her infidelity. But the author's role was to bring up the suspicion, which might not be their responsibility. The question is whether they had the right to voice that suspicion without proof. In many cases, people might not intervene unless there's clear evidence, so the author's action could be seen as meddling.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to ensure Frank was certain about the paternity, especially with a child involved. The comment was made in a casual setting, so maybe it was a way to express concern without direct confrontation. The problem is that the comment led to action, and the author didn't foresee the consequences. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complicated. The author might not be at fault because they were acting on a suspicion they had for a long time, and they didn't have malicious intent. But suggesting a paternity test based on feelings could be seen as overstepping, especially if there's no proof. The key is whether the author had the right to voice that suspicion. Since Annie didn't confirm it directly, the author might have crossed a boundary by pushing Frank to act on it. However, considering the potential consequences of a child not being Frank's, the author might believe they were doing the right thing.\n\nThe answer could be B (No), as the author's intent was to ensure the child's paternity, but there's a counterargument that they shouldn't have meddled. However, the fact that the author had a long-standing suspicion and the context of their close relationship might justify their actions. The main issue is whether the method of bringing it up was appropriate. Since it was done in a casual setting and not directly accusing, the author might not be in the wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
