My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for yelling at their sister for eating $45 cough drops.\n\nFirst, the key facts: The author sells items on eBay, and these cough drops were part of that business. The sister ate them, not knowing their value. The author yells, the sister leaves, and there's lingering guilt. The author later apologizes and doesn't make the sister pay for replacement.\n\nNow, considering the sister's perspective. She took the cough drops, thinking they were regular ones. The author didn't inform her they were for sale, especially since they were in their shared home. The sister had no way of knowing the value, so her action was an honest mistake. The author's reaction of yelling seems excessive for an accidental act, especially when the item was in a shared space. The emotional impact\u2014sister leaving and not talking since\u2014suggests the yelling was harsh.\n\nThe author did apologize and clarified the situation, which is good. But the initial reaction was the problem. The sister didn't have intent to steal, so the author's anger over a $35 profit might be disproportionate. However, the author had a legitimate reason to be upset about losing a product they were selling. But the way they handled it could have been more mature and diplomatic. Yelling and causing family tension over a mistake, even if the item had value, might not be justified, especially when the sister was unaware.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author could have kept the items in a place less accessible to family members or communicated better. The sister's mistake was understandable, and the author's reaction led to a strained relationship. So, while the author had a valid business reason, their emotional response was the issue here. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the reaction was disproportionate and handled poorly, leading to unnecessary conflict.\n"
