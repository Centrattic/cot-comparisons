My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nThe author is selling designer cough drops on eBay, and an auction ended up with a 45$ bid, giving them a 35$ profit. They couldn't find the cough drops after the sale, which they kept in their closet. Then they noticed the mangled box in their sister's room. The sister ate them because she liked the taste. The author confronted her and yelled, which made the sister leave home and go back to college during Christmas break. The author felt bad, apologized, and even went to their college. The sister didn't know the cough drops were valuable or that they were for sale. The buyer gave a 3-star review after being informed.\n\nFirst, I should consider whether the author overreacted. The cough drops were for sale, and the sister consumed them without knowing their value. The author had a right to be upset because they were losing a product they intended to sell, resulting in a 35$ profit loss. However, the way they confronted the sister might have been too harsh. Yelling could be seen as an overreaction, especially if the sister was unaware of the value. The author later apologized, which is a good step, and the sister's reaction (leaving immediately) suggests the confrontation was traumatic for her.\n\nBut the author did take responsibility by going to the sister's college and apologizing, which shows they recognized the mistake. The sister's lack of awareness about the item's value and purpose might mitigate her responsibility. However, the author could have handled the situation more calmly initially instead of yelling. That said, the emotional impact on the sister is significant, and the author's actions led to a strained relationship. \n\nThe key points are: the sister's ignorance of the item's value, the author's emotional response, and the subsequent reconciliation. The author's intent was to protect their business, but the method was harsh. However, they took steps to make amends. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because the sister was negligent in not knowing the value of the item she consumed, and the author had a right to be upset about losing money. But the yelling was a poor approach, which caused more harm. However, the author took responsibility and apologized, which is commendable. The sister might bear some responsibility for not being aware. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but the handling was bad.\n"
