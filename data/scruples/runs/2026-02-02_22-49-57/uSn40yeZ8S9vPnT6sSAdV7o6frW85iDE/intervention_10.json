My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author sold some Supreme cough drops on eBay for $45, made a $35 profit, but then their sister ate them. The author got really angry, yelled at her, and now the sister is upset and hasn't talked to them since. The author feels bad and went to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author worked hard to make that money, right? They probably put time and effort into creating the auction, managing their eBay store, etc. Losing that product would mean losing the potential profit, which is $35. That's not a huge amount, but it's still their income. So, the author might feel wronged because someone took something that was meant to be sold.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister ate the cough drops without knowing they were valuable. She thought they were just normal cough drops. That's a key point. If she didn't know their value, then it's an honest mistake. The author didn't mention if they told the sister about the eBay sale or the Supreme brand. If they didn't, then maybe the sister wasn't aware. So, maybe the author is at least partially responsible for not keeping the item secure or informing her.\n\nBut then, the author's reaction was to yell at her. That's where the conflict escalated. Yelling is a strong reaction, especially over something that the sister didn't know was valuable. Even if the author felt wronged, their response could have been more measured. The sister might have felt attacked, leading her to leave and not talk for a while. The author's actions caused a rift in their relationship, which seems worse than the financial loss.\n\nLooking at the edits, the author went to apologize and set ground rules. They also decided not to make the sister pay, acknowledging it was an honest mistake. This shows that the author realized their reaction was excessive. The sister's perspective is important here; she saw it as overreacting, which makes sense because she didn't know about the auction. The author's anger was justified in terms of the loss, but their emotional response was not proportionate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is partly in the wrong because their reaction was inappropriate given the sister's lack of awareness. However, the sister also took something that wasn't hers, even if by mistake. But the main issue is the yelling and the emotional response. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because their reaction, while understandable, was not proportionate and caused more harm than the financial loss.\n"
