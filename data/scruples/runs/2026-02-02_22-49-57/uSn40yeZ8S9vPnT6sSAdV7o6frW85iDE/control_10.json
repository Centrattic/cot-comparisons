My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is wrong for yelling at their sister about the expensive cough drops.\n\nFirst, the situation: the writer sells designer stuff on eBay. They put up a Supreme cough drop auction that sold for $45, making a $35 profit. They couldn't find the item, found it eaten by their sister, then yelled at her. The sister went back to college and they haven't talked since. The writer feels bad and later apologized, driving to her college. The sister thought the cough drops were normal, didn't know their value.\n\nSo, the main points are: the writer got angry over something the sister didn't realize was valuable. The sister ate them unintentionally. The writer yelled, causing a rift. The writer later apologized but got a 3-star review from the buyer.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. The sister made a mistake, but it was honest. The writer's reaction seems disproportionate to the sister's mistake. The cough drops were valuable due to being designer (Supreme), but the sister had no idea. Yelling and causing her to leave home over an honest mistake could be seen as wrong. The writer later took steps to fix it by apologizing, which is good, but the initial reaction might still be considered wrong because they overreacted.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer had a legitimate financial loss. The item was sold for $45, which is a real loss. But the sister's intent was innocent. The writer should have explained the value first. Maybe they should have been upset but handled it more calmly. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. \n\nIn many cases, if someone unintentionally causes a loss, the responsibility isn't on them, but the other person shouldn't overreact. So the writer might be in the wrong for overreacting and yelling, causing harm to their relationship. The sister's mistake was honest, and the writer's response was excessive. Therefore, answer A (the author is in the wrong) makes sense here.\n"
