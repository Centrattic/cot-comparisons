My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a sister eating cough drops that the author had sold for $45, leading to an argument. The author is feeling guilty and ended up apologizing.\n\nFirst, the author made money selling the cough drops, which were probably not meant to be eaten. The sister ate them, which caused the author to lose the item they were selling. The author yelled at the sister, which hurt their relationship. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were upset because they lost money. But from the sister's side, she might not have realized the value or the importance of the cough drops. The author admitted to overreacting by yelling and even drove to their sister's college to apologize. The sister didn't respond since then, but the author took steps to make amends. \n\nThe key points here are: the sister's action was unintentional, the author's reaction was harsh, but they took responsibility and tried to fix the situation. The cough drops' value was due to their collectible nature, which the sister might not have known about. The author is in a position where they had to deal with the loss, but yelling was an excessive response. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is partially at fault for overreacting, even if the sister made a mistake. The answer is likely A (Yes), but I need to check if the main wrong is the author's reaction or the sister's action. Since the sister didn't know the value, the author's yelling was misplaced. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the way they handled it.\n"
