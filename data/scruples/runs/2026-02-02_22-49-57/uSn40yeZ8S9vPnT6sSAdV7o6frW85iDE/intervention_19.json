My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is selling designer cough drops on eBay and made a profit from an auction that reached $45. They couldn't find the item and later found out their sister ate them. They yelled at her, which led to her leaving and not talking to them since. The author feels bad and ended up apologizing, but there's still a 3-star review from the buyer.\n\nFirst, the key points here are: the sister ate the cough drops without knowing their value, the author felt it was a valuable item, they yelled, causing a rift. The author later apologized and took steps to fix things.\n\nI think the sister's mistake was not knowing the value of the item, maybe because the logo wasn't visible. The author might not have communicated the importance of keeping the item, especially since it was for sale. Yelling was a strong reaction, but the author tried to make amends. The sister might have overreacted by leaving, but the author's initial reaction was maybe too harsh. However, the author isn't entirely wrong because the sister did take someone else's item without permission. But the way the author handled it could have been better. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for overreacting but not entirely wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). The user initially thought the author isn't in the wrong. I think the answer is B, but I need to make sure.\n"
