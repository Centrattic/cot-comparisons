My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves them yelling at their sister for eating cough drops they were selling for $45 on eBay. The sister went back to college and they haven't talked since. The writer feels bad and ended up apologizing, but there's a 3-star review from the buyer now.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The writer was selling the cough drops, which had a profit of $35. The sister ate them thinking they were just regular cough drops. The writer confronted her and yelled, leading to the sister leaving. The writer then apologized and drove to her college to make amends.\n\nSo, was the writer wrong? Well, the sister didn't know the value of the item, which was part of the author's business. The author was upset about losing $35, but yelling might have been an overreaction. However, the author did take responsibility by apologizing and not making the sister pay. The sister's perspective was that the situation wasn't worth getting angry over something she didn't realize was valuable. The writer might have overreacted, but since they took steps to fix the relationship, maybe the wrong is less clear. \n\nThe answer options are A for yes (wrong) or B for no (not wrong). The main factors are intent, reaction proportionality, and resolution. The sister made a mistake, but the writer's reaction was harsh. However, the writer did correct their mistake. So maybe the answer leans towards A because they lost their temper over something the sister didn't realize was valuable, but the resolution might mitigate some of that. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong now. Since they apologized and took steps to fix it, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But the initial yelling was wrong. Hmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer is likely A because they yelled over something the sister didn't know was valuable, but the resolution might not matter for the question. Wait, the question is about being in the wrong, not if they should fix it. So, the author made a mistake by yelling over an honest mistake. So A is the answer.\n"
