My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author sells designer items on eBay, made a profit of $35 from an auction on Supreme cough drops. They couldn't find the item, then realized their sister ate them. The author yelled, and now the sister hasn't talked to them since. The author later apologized and went to her college to make amends.\n\nSo, the key points here are the value of the item. Supreme is a brand, so these were likely limited edition or collectible cough drops. The sister ate them without knowing their value. The author got angry, which caused a rift. \n\nThe author's actions: Yelling at the sister. The sister's perspective: She was eating something she thought was regular cough drops. The author made an honest mistake, but the author's reaction was harsh. \n\nThe author took responsibility later by apologizing and driving to her college. Also, they didn't make the sister pay, recognizing it was an honest mistake. The buyer gave a 3-star review after the situation was explained.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. The sister didn't know the value, so it's an honest mistake. The author's response was yelling, which might be disproportionate, especially over a $35 profit. The emotional impact on the sister was significant\u2014she left and didn't talk to the author since. However, the author took steps to mend the relationship.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They were upset about losing a valuable item and made a profit from it. But their reaction was yelling, which could be seen as overreacting. The sister didn't intend to cause harm. The author's actions led to a broken relationship, but they took initiative to fix it. \n\nSome might argue that the author was justified because the item was valuable and part of their income. Others might say that yelling over an honest mistake, especially family, is wrong. The fact that they apologized and tried to fix things shows they recognize the mistake, but the initial reaction was harsh.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions were wrong in the moment but they took corrective measures. The question is whether the initial action was in the wrong. Since the sister had no intent to harm, and the author's reaction caused a bigger issue than necessary, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). However, the context of eBay business and the value could justify some frustration. But overall, the yelling over an honest mistake within family is likely seen as the author's fault.\n"
