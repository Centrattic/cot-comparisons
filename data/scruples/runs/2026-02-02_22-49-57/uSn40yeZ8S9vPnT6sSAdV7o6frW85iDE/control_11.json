My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a sister eating cough drops that the author was selling on eBay for $45. The author got angry, yelled at her sister, and now they're not talking. The sister went back to college and hasn't spoken since.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author bought the Supreme cough drops, listed them on eBay, and sold them for $45, making a $35 profit. The sister ate them, not knowing their value. The author got angry, yelled, and the sister left. The author later apologized, didn't make the sister pay, and the buyer gave a 3-star review.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's reaction was justified. On one hand, the cough drops were valuable because they were being sold as designer items. If the sister didn't know their value, maybe she didn't realize the impact of eating them. The author might have felt wronged because they were about to sell them for profit. But on the other hand, cough drops are consumables. Even though they were designer, the sister consuming them might not have been a malicious act. The author's reaction was yelling, which might have been excessive given that it was a mistake. The author later took steps to apologize and resolve the situation, which shows they recognized a mistake in their approach.\n\nThe sister's perspective is important too. She didn't know the value, so it was an honest mistake. The author's anger over $35 profit might seem disproportionate, especially over a sibling relationship. The emotional impact of yelling leading to the sister leaving and not talking is significant. The author's initial reaction could be seen as prioritizing money over family feelings, which might make them in the wrong. However, the author did take responsibility by apologizing and explaining the situation to the buyer, which mitigates some blame.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author was in the wrong. The sister's mistake was honest, and the author's response was yelling, which hurt the relationship. Even if the cough drops were valuable, the way the author handled it was harsh. The author later acknowledged this and made amends, which suggests they realized their mistake. So in the initial situation, the author's reaction was inconsiderate, leading to the sister's departure. However, the author took steps to fix it. The question is if the author was in the wrong originally. The answer would likely be yes (A) because the reaction was disproportionate and caused harm, even if it was over an honest mistake. The sister didn't intend to cause harm, so the author's yelling was unjustified.\n"
