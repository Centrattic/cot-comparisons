My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation is that the sister ate the cough drops that the author was selling, leading to a loss of $35 profit. The author confronted her, yelled, and the sister left. The user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author probably felt wronged because they were making money from the sale, so losing the item would affect their income. Yelling might be an overreaction, as the sister didn't know the value and just ate them. The sister's perspective is that the cough drops are normal, so she didn't realize their value. The author later apologized and didn't make her pay, which shows they acknowledged the sister's innocence.\n\nBut was the anger justified? The amount is $35, which isn't huge, but for someone who depends on such sales, maybe it's significant. However, yelling and causing a rift over that seems harsh. The author admitted they felt bad afterward and took steps to make amends, which is positive. The sister leaving might have been because she was upset by the yelling.\n\nThe key points are intention vs. reaction. The sister didn't intend to harm; it was an honest mistake. The author's reaction, while understandable, might have been disproportionate. The fact that they later apologized and tried to fix things suggests the author realized their mistake in the heat of the moment.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's initial reaction was wrong because the sister didn't know the value. The author should have been calmer and explained the situation instead of yelling. Thus, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to check if the user's own view is different. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but maybe the community would say A. Hmm. Wait, the options are A for yes (author wrong) and B for no. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer here would be A because the sister didn't know, and the author overreacted.\n"
