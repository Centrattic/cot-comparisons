My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over cough drops. The situation is that the sister ate the cough drops that the author had sold for $45, which led to her going back to college and not talking since.\n\nFirst, the author made a profit of $35 from selling them. But the sister didn't know their value and ate them, which was an honest mistake. The author was upset because they lost the item they were supposed to deliver, leading to a bad review. However, the sister didn't intend to take them for profit or maliciously. \n\nThe author yelled a lot, which caused emotional distress. The sister's reaction was to leave, indicating that the yelling was hurtful. Even though the author later apologized and drove to her college, the initial reaction was excessive given that it was an honest mistake. The value of $35 isn't that high to justify yelling and causing a rift in their relationship.\n\nIn the end, the author took responsibility by apologizing and not making the sister pay, which shows they realized their mistake. But the question is about whether the author was in the wrong at the time. The key points are the sister's lack of intent, the emotional response being disproportionate, and the lasting impact on their relationship. So, the answer would be Yes, the author was in the wrong.\n"
