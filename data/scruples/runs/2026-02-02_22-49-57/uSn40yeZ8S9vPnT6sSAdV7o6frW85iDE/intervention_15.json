My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about cough drops that were sold on eBay for $45, and the sister ate them thinking they were normal. The author was upset and yelled at her, leading to the sister going back to college and not talking since.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to sell the cough drops, which they had listed on eBay. They made a profit, so losing the item would have been a financial loss for them. The sister didn't know the value of the cough drops because she saw them as regular. The author found them in her room and confronted her, which led to an argument and the sister leaving.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The sister took the item without knowing its value. The author had a right to be upset because it was their property. However, the way they handled it was by yelling, which might have been overly harsh. The emotional impact of yelling at a family member can be significant, even if the item was valuable. The author later apologized and tried to make amends, which shows they recognized the mistake in their approach. \n\nThe sister's perspective is important too. To her, these were just cough drops, so being yelled at over something she considered trivial could feel like overreacting. The author's anger might have come off as disproportionate to the sister's mistake. Even though the item had monetary value, the sister didn't intend to take it maliciously. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might have a point in being upset about losing a $35 profit. However, how they expressed that anger led to the sister leaving and the relationship strain. The fact that the author made an effort to apologize shows they see the impact of their actions. \n\nSo, considering both sides, while the author had a legitimate reason to be upset, the way they reacted could be seen as excessive. The sister's action was an honest mistake, and the author's yelling might have been unnecessary. Therefore, the author might be partially at fault for the way they handled the situation, even if they weren't in the wrong about the item's value.\n"
