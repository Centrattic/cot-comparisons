My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about yelling at their sister for eating their $45 cough drops, which they had listed on eBay. The sister went back to college and hasn't talked to them since. The author feels bad and later went to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was selling the cough drops for a profit, so they had an investment in them. The sister ate them, not knowing their value. The author got angry and yelled, leading to a breakdown in their relationship. \n\nBut was the author wrong? Well, the sister didn't know the drops were for sale. They might have just seen them as regular cough drops. The author maybe didn't communicate that they were for eBay, so the sister had no way of knowing. The author's reaction was intense over a financial loss that, while real, might not justify the emotional damage caused by yelling and ruining the relationship. \n\nAlso, the author later apologized and took responsibility, which is good. They even decided not to make the sister pay because it was an honest mistake. But the initial reaction of yelling seems excessive. The sister might have felt guilty or hurt, leading her to leave. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, maybe the author is partially at fault for not clearly labeling the item and for overreacting. The sister didn't intend to harm their sibling, so the author's response was disproportionate. However, the author did make amends, which shows they recognized their mistake. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister might have been careless with her brother's property. But since she didn't know the value, it's an honest mistake. The author should have been understanding. So, I think the author is in the wrong for yelling over something the sister didn't know about and causing the rift. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
