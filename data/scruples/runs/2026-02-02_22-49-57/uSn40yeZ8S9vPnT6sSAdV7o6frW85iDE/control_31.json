My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that were up for sale on eBay, which ended up selling for $45.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had listed the cough drops as an auction and made a profit. The sister ate them without realizing their value. The author got angry, yelled, and the sister left. Then the author went to apologize but didn't make the sister pay because it was an honest mistake.\n\nSo, the key points here are intent. Did the sister know the cough drops were valuable? The author mentions the sister didn't know the logo, implying she wasn't aware they were for sale. The author's reaction was yelling, which might be excessive given the sister's lack of knowledge. The author later took responsibility by apologizing and explaining to the buyer, which shows some remorse.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did own the item and had the right to be upset about losing a sale. However, the way they reacted could have been more measured. Yelling and causing a rift might have been avoidable with a calmer approach. The sister's action was a mistake, not theft, since she didn't know the item's value.\n\nSo, while the sister made a mistake, the author's reaction was harsh. The author could have handled the situation better by communicating calmly and maybe educating the sister about the item's value instead of yelling. The fact that the author went to apologize shows they recognized their mistake in handling the situation, but the initial yelling was likely unwarranted given the sister's lack of intent to cause harm.\n"
