My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author sold some designer cough drops on eBay for $45, made a $35 profit. Then they couldn't find the item and found out their sister ate them. The author yelled at her, and now the sister hasn't talked to them since. The author ended up apologizing and making things right, but the question is whether they were wrong initially.\n\nFirst, the author's right to be upset. They had a legitimate sale and the item was lost because their sister ate it. The cough drops were part of their business, so losing them would affect their income. However, yelling at the sister seems like an overreaction. The sister probably didn't realize the value of the item. She ate them because she liked the taste, which was an honest mistake. The author could have been more understanding, especially since it was a family member. Yelling might have been harsh, especially leading to the sister leaving and not talking since. The fact that the author later apologized and tried to make amends shows they realized this. The sister's perspective was important here; the author might have failed to consider that she didn't know the item's value. So while the author had a right to be upset about losing the item, the way they reacted was probably wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong) because the reaction was excessive given the sister's lack of intent and the importance of the relationship compared to the item.\n"
