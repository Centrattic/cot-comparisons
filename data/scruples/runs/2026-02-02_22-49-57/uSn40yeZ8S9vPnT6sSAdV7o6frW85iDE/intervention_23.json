My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister eating cough drops that the author was selling on eBay for $45, leading to a yelling match and a fallout.\n\nFirst, the author spent time and effort listing the item, the cough drops sold for $45, and the sister ate them without knowing their value. The author was upset because that was a significant amount of money for them, considering they make a profit from such sales. The sister, on the other hand, didn't realize the item's value and ate them, thinking they were just regular cough drops. \n\nThe key points here are intent and context. The sister didn't know the drops were being sold online, so her action was an honest mistake. However, the author was emotional about losing a product that took effort to sell, leading to yelling. While the author's reaction was intense, it's understandable given the circumstances\u2014especially if this profit is important for their eBay business. \n\nThe author later apologized and took steps to mend the relationship, which shows they recognized the emotional impact of their actions. The sister's perspective was that the author overreacted, but the author had a valid reason to be upset about losing a product they were selling. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author wasn't in the wrong because the sister made a mistake, and the author had a legitimate reason to be upset. However, yelling was a harsh reaction, but the context of the situation (lost profit and effort) might justify their anger. The resolution they took by apologizing shows they tried to make things right, which balances the situation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
