My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author sold some designer cough drops for $45, made a $35 profit, but then found out their sister ate them. The author yelled at her, and now the sister is upset and hasn't talked to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author clearly had a financial stake in those cough drops. They were selling them on eBay, so this wasn't just a personal item; it was a business transaction. The sister ate them without realizing they were valuable, probably because they were cough drops, which aren't typically expensive. The author might not have communicated the value to the sister, maybe because it's a common item she'd use. But the author also had a right to be upset about losing a product they were selling, especially since they made a profit from it.\n\nBut then there's the way the author reacted. Yelling at the sister in a high-pitched and intense manner could be seen as overreacting. The sister ate them by mistake, not intending to steal or cause harm. The author's reaction might have been too harsh, leading the sister to feel attacked, hence her leaving. The sister might not have known the item was that valuable, especially if the author kept it in a place where others might not realize its value. \n\nHowever, the author did take initiative to apologize and clarify the situation, which shows they recognized their part in the conflict. They also didn't make the sister pay for them, acknowledging it was an honest mistake. So, the author might have been in the right to be upset but handled it poorly. The sister's action was a mistake, but the author's reaction might have been excessive given the circumstances. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the author should have better secured or labeled the item, especially since it's a business item. The sister, on the other hand, might have been careless in eating something from her sibling's closet. But since it was an accident, the author's yelling could have been the bigger issue. The resolution the author took by apologizing and clarifying shows they understood the sister's perspective. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for being upset about losing a product they intended to sell. However, the way they expressed their anger was problematic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the sister made an honest mistake and the author overreacted, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong but their reaction was inappropriate. But the initial question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might be a bit nuanced, but given the options of A or B, probably B (No) because the author had a valid reason for being upset but handled it poorly. However, some might argue that the author is in the wrong for overreacting. Hmm.\n"
