My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation involves the sister eating them, the author being upset, and the fallout.\n\nFirst, the author sold the cough drops for $45 on eBay, making a $35 profit. The sister ate them without realizing their value. The author found them in her room and yelled, leading to the sister leaving and not talking since. The author later apologized and drove to her college, but the buyer gave a 3-star review.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the sister's actions were an honest mistake. The author's reaction might be seen as over the top, given that cough drops aren't typically worth that much. But the context is e-commerce, so the author might have invested time/effort into the sale. However, yelling and causing a rift seems excessive. The author did apologize and make amends, which mitigates some fault. The sister's perspective is important here\u2014she didn't know the value, so the author's anger could be seen as disproportionate. On the other hand, the author had a right to be upset about losing the item they intended to sell. \n\nBalancing both sides, the sister's mistake was honest, and the author's reaction, while understandable, was harsh. The author taking steps to reconcile shows they recognized this. So, maybe the author is partially at fault but not entirely. However, the question is binary: A or B. Since the sister made a mistake and the author's reaction was harsh but they made amends, it's a toss-up. But in terms of right and wrong, the sister didn't mean to harm, so the author's response was wrong in being overly aggressive. So answer A (yes, in the wrong).\n"
