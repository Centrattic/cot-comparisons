My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister for eating $45 cough drops. The situation is that the author sold the cough drops on eBay for a profit, but the sister ate them without knowing their value.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made $35 profit from selling something they were planning to use for resale. The sister consumed the item thinking it was just regular cough drops. The author was upset and yelled at her, leading to the sister leaving for college during a break and not talking to them since.\n\nThe user is reflecting on whether the reaction was justified. The sister didn't know the item was for sale, so it's an honest mistake. The author's emotional response (yelling) might be seen as disproportionate to the situation, even though the item had value. However, the author did take responsibility by going to apologize and not making the sister pay. The sister's perspective is important here; from her view, it was just cough drops she liked the taste of.\n\nConsidering these factors, the author's initial reaction might be the issue. While the cough drops were valuable to the author, the sister had no way of knowing. The yelling caused a rift in their relationship. The author later took steps to mend it, which shows they recognize the problem. But the question is about whether they were in the wrong initially. Since the sister didn't intentionally take the item, the author's outburst was likely unwarranted. So the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong for overreacting.\n"
