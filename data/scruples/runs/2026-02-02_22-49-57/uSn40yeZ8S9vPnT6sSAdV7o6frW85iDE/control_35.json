My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. First, I need to consider the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author made the cough drops available on eBay, sold them for $45, and then found out their sister ate them. They yelled at her, leading to a breakdown in their relationship. The sister didn't know the item was valuable and just liked the taste. The author later apologized but felt it wasn't worth the $35 profit.\n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. The sister didn't know the cough drops were valuable, so her actions were an honest mistake. The author's reaction was yelling and causing emotional distress over what the sister perceived as regular cough drops. Even though the author had a financial loss, the sister's lack of awareness is important. The author could have handled it more calmly, maybe by explaining the situation instead of yelling. Also, the fact that the author took initiative to apologize and make amends shows they realized their mistake. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sister's actions were unintentional, and the author's reaction was disproportionate given the context. So, while both might have some faults, the main issue is the author overreacting. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
