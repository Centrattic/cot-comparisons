My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author sold some designer cough drops on eBay for $45, made a $35 profit, and then their sister ate them. The author yelled at her and they haven't talked since. The author later went to apologize and explained to the buyer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The cough drops were part of a business transaction, so they had value beyond just the item itself. The author probably worked hard to get that profit, so losing it might have been frustrating. However, the sister didn't know they were for sale, so that's an honest mistake.\n\nThe author's reaction was yelling, which might have been excessive, especially over $35. But the sister's action was unintentional. The author later took steps to repair the relationship and even contacted the buyer, showing responsibility. \n\nThe key points are: the sister didn't know the value, the author overreacted by yelling, but made amends. So while the author might have overreacted, the sister's mistake was honest. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because the item was valuable to them, but their initial reaction could be seen as harsh. However, since they made an effort to fix things, maybe the answer is B (No). But maybe some would argue that yelling over a mistake is wrong. Hmm.\n"
