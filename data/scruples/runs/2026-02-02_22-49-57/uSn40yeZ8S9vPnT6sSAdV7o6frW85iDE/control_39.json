My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about them yelling at their sister for eating their $45 cough drops. \n\nFirst, I need to break down what happened. The author sells designer items on eBay and had an auction for Supreme cough drops that sold for $45. They made $35 profit. Then they couldn't find the item and found out their sister ate them. They yelled at her, which led to her going back to college and not talking to them since. The author now feels bad and is planning to apologize.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the sister ate the cough drops, the author was upset about losing $35 profit, yelled at her, and caused a rift. The sister's perspective was that it was over normal cough drops, not knowing their value. The author later apologized and didn't make her pay.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The argument would be that losing $35 profit is not worth yelling over, especially since it's family. The sister didn't know the value, so it was an honest mistake. The author's reaction was disproportionate, leading to the sister leaving and the relationship being strained. The fact that the author later apologized shows they realized their mistake.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they had a right to be upset since they were losing actual money from a sale. However, the way they handled it\u2014yelling and causing emotional harm\u2014might have been excessive. Family relationships are important, and the value of the item is $45, which isn't that high. The sister didn't know the value, so it's not intentional theft. The author's reaction was harsh, leading to a bigger problem than the item's worth.\n\nSo, the author probably is in the wrong because the emotional response was too strong for the situation, leading to unnecessary damage to the sister relationship. The sister's mistake was honest, and the author could have handled it more calmly. The fact that they apologized later suggests they knew their reaction was too harsh.\n"
