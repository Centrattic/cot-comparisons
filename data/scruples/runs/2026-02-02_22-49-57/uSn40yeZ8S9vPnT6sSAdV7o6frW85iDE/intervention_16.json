My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a sibling conflict over cough drops sold online.\n\nFirst, the author sold designer cough drops for $45 on eBay, making a $35 profit. The sister ate them without knowing their value, leading to an argument where the author yelled. The sister left for college and they haven't spoken since. The author later apologized and the sister didn't know the item's worth.\n\nSo, the key points: The sister didn't know the cough drops were valuable. The author felt wronged because they were about to sell them. But the sister's intent wasn't malicious. The author's reaction was yelling, which might have been excessive. However, the author later took steps to make amends by apologizing and not making the sister pay for replacement.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the sister's mistake led to losing a valuable item. The author had the right to be upset about losing a product they intended to sell. However, yelling and causing a rift could be seen as overreacting, especially since the sister didn't know. But considering the author took responsibility and tried to fix it, maybe they aren't entirely wrong. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the mistake was forgivable. Since the sister didn't know their value, the author might not be in the wrong for being upset but could have handled it better. However, the problem is whether the author had the right to be so angry over an honest mistake. So, maybe the answer is B (No), because the sister didn't intend to harm, and the author's reaction was harsh but they tried to make amends.\n"
