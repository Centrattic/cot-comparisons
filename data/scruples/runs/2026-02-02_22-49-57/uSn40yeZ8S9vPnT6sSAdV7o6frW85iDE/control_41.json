My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they yelled at their sister for eating their $45 cough drops, which they were planning to sell on eBay. The sister ended up going back to college and hasn't talked to them since. The author feels bad and later went to apologize, but the sister's perspective was that it was over some normal cough drops, maybe not knowing their value.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the value of the item. The cough drops were sold for $45, which seems high for something that's normally a low-cost item. The author made a $35 profit, which might not be a huge amount but still significant to them. However, the sister didn't know about the auction, so she had no idea they were worth that much. From her point of view, she just ate cough drops she thought were regular ones. \n\nThe author's reaction was yelling, which can be seen as overreacting, especially since the sister had no intention of stealing or being malicious. The emotional impact on the sister was significant enough that she left and didn't talk to the author for a while. The author later apologized, which shows they recognized the mistake. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be at fault for not keeping their items secure, especially if they're valuable. If they were planning to sell them, maybe they should have stored them somewhere more protected. On the other hand, the sister didn't check if they belonged to someone else before consuming them. \n\nHowever, yelling and causing a rift over an honest mistake seems excessive. The fact that the author went to apologize and took responsibility is a positive step, but the initial reaction was harsh. The sister's reaction of leaving is also a bit extreme, but the context matters. The author's anger was disproportionate given the sister's lack of intent. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably did overreact, and thus is in the wrong. The sister made a mistake but without malicious intent, and the author's response was too harsh, leading to a breakdown in their relationship. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
