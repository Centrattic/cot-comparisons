My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who yelled at their sister for eating their $45 cough drops is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The author sells items on eBay and had an auction for Supreme cough drops that sold for $45. They made a $35 profit. Then they couldn't find the cough drops and found out their sister ate them. The author yelled at her, leading to the sister going back to college and not talking to them since. The author feels bad and later apologized.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The cough drops were being sold on eBay, so they weren't just regular cough drops; they were part of a business transaction. The sister didn't know their value, as the author mentions she liked the taste and didn't notice the logo. The author yelled at her, which caused a rift in their relationship. The author later apologized and didn't make the sister pay for them because it was an honest mistake. The buyer gave a 3-star review after being informed about the situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, yelling at a sibling over something that was an honest mistake, even if the item had value, might be seen as overreacting. The sister didn't know the cough drops were for sale and intended to be delivered. The author's reaction led to a significant emotional fallout. However, the author did take steps to fix the situation by apologizing and not making the sister pay. The buyer's 3-star review might not be entirely the author's fault since they informed them about the situation.\n\nBut the main issue here is the emotional response. Yelling and damaging a sibling relationship over $35 profit might be considered disproportionate. The sister's perspective is important here\u2014she didn't know the value of the item, so the author's anger seems unjustified. The fact that the author later regrets it and makes amends shows they recognized their mistake. However, the initial reaction was the cause of the problem.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting, even though they took steps to correct it afterward. The sister's mistake was honest, and the author's yelling was excessive. Therefore, the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
