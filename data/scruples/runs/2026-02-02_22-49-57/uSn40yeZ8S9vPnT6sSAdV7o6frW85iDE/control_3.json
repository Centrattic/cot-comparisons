My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops they were planning to sell for $45. The sister didn't know their value and ate them, which led to the author losing the item they were going to sell. The author ended up going to their sister's college to apologize and even talked to the buyer, who gave a 3-star review.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The sister made an honest mistake. She ate the cough drops not knowing they were valuable. The author got angry and yelled at her. Even though the item was worth money, the sister didn't have malicious intent. The author, in their anger, caused a rift in their relationship. Then, the author took steps to fix it by apologizing and not making the sister pay, which shows some responsibility. But the initial reaction was yelling, which might have been excessive given the sister's mistake. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the sister didn't know the value, so she didn't intentionally take them. The author's reaction might have been overly harsh. Even though the item had value, it's not like the sister stole it with intent. The author should have explained the situation calmly. But the fact that the author went back to apologize shows they realized their mistake. However, the question is about whether they were in the wrong initially. Since the sister made an honest error, yelling at her for something she didn't know about could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
