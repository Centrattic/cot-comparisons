My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an opinion on whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author sells designer items on eBay and had an auction for Supreme cough drops that sold for $45, making a $35 profit. They couldn't find the item until they saw the sister had eaten them. The author then yelled at the sister, which caused a rift since the sister went back to college and hasn't talked to them since.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the cough drops were for sale, the sister ate them without knowing they were for sale, the author was upset about losing the profit, and the reaction led to a broken relationship. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is not in the wrong, but they want to hear my perspective. Let's consider both sides. \n\nFrom the author's side: They made an effort to sell the item, which they presumably bought as a collector's item or for resale. The sister's action caused a financial loss. The author's reaction was yelling, which is a strong response, but maybe they felt justified because of the time and money invested. However, yelling is an aggressive way to handle it, and the consequences (sister leaving and not talking) might be disproportionate.\n\nFrom the sister's side: She might not have realized the value of the item. Eating something that looks like regular cough drops could be an honest mistake. The author didn't explain the item's significance before selling it, so maybe the sister didn't know it was valuable. The author's anger seems excessive if the sister had no intention of stealing or being malicious.\n\nThe author later apologized and tried to make amends by driving to her college. That shows some responsibility. Also, they didn't make the sister pay for it, which is a good gesture. But the fact that the author yelled and caused the sister to leave might have been too harsh, especially for an accidental mistake.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors are intention, proportionality of the response, and responsibility. The sister's action was accidental, but the author's reaction was yelling, which led to a significant fallout. The financial loss is $35, which isn't trivial, but dealing with family conflicts over money can be tricky.\n\nI think the author's response was disproportionate. Yelling and causing a family member to cut off contact over a $35 loss, especially when the sister made an honest mistake, seems overly harsh. The author could have handled it more calmly, maybe by discussing it and explaining the item's value. However, the author did take steps to apologize and resolve the situation, which is positive. But the initial reaction was the issue. So, considering all that, the author is partly at fault for overreacting, but maybe not entirely since the sister was responsible for taking something that was meant to be sold. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because of the harsh reaction and the relationship damage caused.\n"
