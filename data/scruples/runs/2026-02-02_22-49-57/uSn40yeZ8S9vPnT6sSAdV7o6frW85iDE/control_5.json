My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. They sold them on eBay and then found out the sister ate them. They yelled, which led to the sister going back to college and not talking to them since.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The author made $35 profit from a $45 item. They kept it in their closet, but the sister ate them, thinking they were regular cough drops. The author didn't mention the item's value or the eBay auction to the sister. When confronted, the author yelled, leading to the sister leaving home.\n\nNow, considering responsibility. The author didn't inform the sister about the item's value. They stored it in a place accessible to the sister. Maybe they should have kept it more secure or told her not to touch. Yelling over an accidental mistake seems harsh, especially over $35. The sister didn't know the value, so it was an honest mistake. The author later apologized and went to make amends, which is a good step. However, the initial reaction was to yell, which escalated things. The fact that the sister felt scared enough to leave home suggests the yelling was excessive. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate the importance of the item and overreacted. Their own mistake in not securing the item or informing the sister contributed to the situation. The answer is likely A.\n"
