My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about them yelling at their sister for eating $45 cough drops they were selling on eBay. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author sold the cough drops for $45, made a $35 profit, but the sister ate them. The author was upset, yelled, and the sister left. The author then went to apologize but still set some ground rules.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the value of the item and the reaction. The cough drops were sold for $45, which is a lot for something that's normally not expensive. The sister didn't know their value and just ate them because she liked the taste. The author's reaction was yelling, which caused a rift. \n\nNow, considering the sister's perspective, she didn't know the cough drops were for sale. If they were just normal cough drops, eating them might be a mistake. The high price might be due to the brand or the auction dynamics, but the sister had no way of knowing. The author, however, kept the cough drops in their closet, which might mean they weren't clearly labeled or stored in a way that others would know their value. \n\nWas the author in the wrong? They might be because the sister had no way of knowing the item's value. The author's reaction was extreme for an honest mistake. Even though the author later apologized, the initial yelling was unwarranted. Also, the fact that the author stored the item in a closet could be seen as not making it obvious, which contributes to the sister's mistake. \n\nBut then, the author was selling the item, so maybe they should have stored it more securely. However, cough drops aren't typically high-value items, so expecting others to know they're for sale might be unreasonable unless clearly marked. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's anger over $35 profit seems excessive. The sister's action was an accident, and yelling led to the sister leaving. The author's realization that it wasn't worth the conflict shows they understand the mistake. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's reaction was disproportionate to the mistake. While the sister made an error, the author's anger and yelling were unjustified, making the author at least partly at fault. So the answer would be A, yes.\n"
