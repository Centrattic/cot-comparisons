My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the AITA (asshole of the situation) for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The context is that they sold these cough drops on eBay with a profit of $35. They couldn't find the item until they saw their sister had eaten them. They yelled at her, which led to the sister going back to college during Christmas break and not talking to them since. The author feels bad and later apologized, but the sister might have not realized the value of the item.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author was running an eBay business, so these cough drops were meant to be sold. The sister ate them without knowing their value. The author's reaction was yelling, which caused a rift. The key points here are intent and the proportionality of the response.\n\nThe sister's perspective is important. If she didn't know the cough drops were valuable, maybe she didn't realize the mistake. The author, however, was managing a business and relied on these items for profit. Losing a sale because of a mistake could be frustrating. But yelling and causing a family conflict over $35 profit might be excessive. \n\nThe author later apologized and went to the sister's college, which shows they recognized the issue. However, the initial reaction was harsh. Even if the sister was at fault for eating the item, the author's yelling might have been the main problem here. Family relationships are important, and overreacting to a minor financial loss could be seen as the author's mistake.\n\nAlso, considering the sister's reaction, leaving during Christmas break suggests the argument was hurtful. The author's actions might have been too harsh given the circumstances. The sister's lack of awareness about the item's value could mitigate her responsibility, but the author's response was more about their business loss than respecting the sister's intentions.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author might be in the wrong because their reaction was disproportionate to the situation, especially since the sister didn't know the value. The author could have handled it more calmly to preserve the relationship instead of yelling, which led to a bigger problem.\n"
