My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister for eating cough drops they sold on eBay for $45. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author sold the cough drops on eBay, made a profit, but then the sister ate them. The author was upset and yelled, leading to the sister leaving for college and not talking since. The author later apologized and went to make things right.\n\nThe key points here are: the value of the item (cough drops sold for $45), the sister's action (eating them without knowing their value), and the author's reaction (yelling). \n\nThe author's mistake might be in overreacting to an honest mistake. The sister didn't know the cough drops were valuable; she just liked the taste. The author could have handled it without yelling. Even though the item had monetary value to the author, the sister didn't intend to steal. The emotional response caused a rift in their relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did take responsibility by apologizing and not making the sister pay. They also resolved the situation by contacting the buyer. But the initial reaction of yelling might be seen as disproportionate. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They made a mistake in their reaction, but not necessarily in the right to be upset. The sister's action was unintentional. The author's anger led to a bigger problem. However, taking responsibility mitigates some of the blame. But the main issue is the yelling over an honest mistake. That seems like the author's fault here. \n\nSo the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they overreacted, even if they later made amends. The key is the sister didn't know the value, so yelling was excessive.\n"
