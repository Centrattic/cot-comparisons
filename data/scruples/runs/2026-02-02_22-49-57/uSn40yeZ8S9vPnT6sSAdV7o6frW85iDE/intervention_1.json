My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation involves the sister eating the cough drops that the author was selling on eBay, leading to a fallout where the sister went back to college and they haven't talked since. The author later apologized and went to visit them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The cough drops were part of the author's business, which they were using to make a profit. The sister didn't know their value and ate them. The author's reaction was yelling, which might have been excessive given the circumstances. However, the sister's action was an honest mistake. The author later took steps to reconcile, so their intention wasn't malicious.\n\nOn one hand, the sister made a mistake by consuming something she wasn't supposed to. On the other hand, the author's response was yelling, which might have been harsh, especially considering the sister didn't realize the financial value. The author also took responsibility by apologizing and visiting the sister, which shows they recognized their mistake in handling the situation.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. While the sister's action was wrong, the author's reaction might have been excessive. However, since the author made amends, maybe the initial reaction isn't the main issue here. The key is whether the yelling was justified. Since the sister didn't know the value, and the author was using it for their business, the author might have a valid point. But yelling could be seen as overreacting. \n\nHowever, the sister's response was to leave and not talk since, which is a big consequence. The author's reaction might have contributed to that. But since they later took steps to fix it, maybe the initial yelling isn't the main fault. The sister's action was the root problem. So, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they had a right to be upset about losing an item they were selling. However, their reaction could be seen as too harsh. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the sister made a mistake, and the author had a right to be upset, but their reaction was yelling, which could be considered wrong. Hmm. Maybe the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because yelling over a mistake that wasn't malicious could be excessive. Alternatively, B (no) because the sister ate something that wasn't hers with no awareness of the value. The answer depends on whether the yelling was justified. In many cases, people would say that the author overreacted. So maybe A is the answer. But the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to decide based on the situation. The sister's mistake was honest, and the author's yelling led to a bigger problem. The author's business was affected, which is valid, but the reaction might have been too harsh. So maybe A is correct. But some might argue that the author had the right to be upset. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards A because the sister didn't know, and the yelling could be seen as disproportionate. Alternatively, B because the author's intention was to protect their business. Hmm. I think the answer is A because the author overreacted.\n"
