My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves yelling at a sister for eating cough drops that were worth $45, leading to a strained relationship.\n\nFirst, the author sold the cough drops on eBay for $45, making a $35 profit. They couldn't find them until seeing the sister had eaten them. The sister's reasoning was she liked the taste. The author yelled, leading to the sister leaving and not talking since.\n\nNow, considering the sister's perspective: she might not have realized the items were valuable. Cough drops aren't typically something people expect to be worth that much, especially if they're a brand she's not familiar with. The author didn't mention the value or that they were for sale. So, the sister might have just taken them thinking they were regular cough drops.\n\nThe author's reaction was yelling, which escalated the situation. The sister left, and the author later apologized. The key points here are whether the sister had intent to steal or was genuinely unaware. If it was an honest mistake, the author's reaction was excessive for the value, especially since the sister didn't know. However, the author did own the cough drops and had the right to be upset about losing a $35 profit. But the way they handled it, yelling and causing a rift, might be where they went wrong.\n\nAlso, the author took the initiative to apologize, which shows they recognized their mistake in the handling, even if not the initial ownership. So, the wrong here is more about the reaction rather than the act of being upset. The sister's mistake was innocent, so the author's harsh response was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong in terms of their reaction and handling the situation.\n"
