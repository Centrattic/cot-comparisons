My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister eating cough drops that the author was selling for $45, which they bought to resell. The author got angry, yelled, and the sister left. Later, the author apologized and decided not to make the sister pay because it was an honest mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a legitimate financial loss because they were using the cough drops for business. They probably worked hard to get that money, so feeling upset makes sense. However, yelling and causing a rift with their sister over $35 profit might be seen as overreacting. The sister didn't know the value of the drops since she just ate them for taste. The author later apologized and tried to make things right, which shows they realized their reaction was too harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister had no intention of stealing and didn't understand the item's value. The author's initial reaction was to yell, which might have been unnecessary. The fact that they went to college and stopped talking shows the impact of the argument. The author's decision to apologize and not ask for compensation is a positive step. \n\nSo, was the author wrong? They were justified in being upset about the lost profit, but their reaction was excessive given the sister's lack of intent. The key here is whether the emotional response was proportionate. Yelling and causing a breakdown in communication suggests they overreacted. However, the author's follow-up actions (apologizing, not making the sister pay) mitigate some of the wrongdoing. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, maybe the author is mostly at fault for overreacting but not entirely wrong since they had a legitimate grievance. However, the question is whether they are \"in the wrong.\" Given that the sister made a mistake without malicious intent, the author's harsh reaction makes them the one at fault. So the answer would lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because they overreacted, even if they had a reason.\n"
