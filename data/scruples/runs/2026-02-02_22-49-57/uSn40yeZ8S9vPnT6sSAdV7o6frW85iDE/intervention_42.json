My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author sold some Supreme cough drops for $45, made a $35 profit, but then their sister ate them. The author got really angry, yelled at her, and now the sister hasn't talked to them since. The author feels bad and even went to apologize, but the sister was upset because she didn't realize the value of the item.\n\nFirst, the author is running a business. The cough drops were part of that business, so losing them would affect their income. The sister ate them by mistake, thinking they were regular cough drops. The author didn't mention the value or the brand to her, maybe? If the sister didn't know they were valuable, then maybe she didn't intend to take them. But she still took them and consumed something that was meant for sale.\n\nBut the author's reaction was yelling and being harsh. Even though the sister made a mistake, the author could have handled it more calmly. Yelling might have been an overreaction, especially since the sister didn't know the value. The author's business is important, but maybe they should have explained the situation before getting angry. However, the sister also didn't ask or check if they were someone else's property. It's a bit of a shared responsibility. The author might feel entitled to their belongings, but the way they reacted could have caused unnecessary harm to their relationship. The fact that the author later apologized shows they realized the mistake in their approach. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but their reaction was excessive. The sister's actions were innocent, so the main fault isn't on her. The author's response, though, could have been more understanding. But considering the context of someone's business being affected, maybe both sides have some responsibility. Hmm, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they had a right to be upset about losing a product they sold, but their yelling might have been unwise. However, the sister also didn't check if it was someone else's. So maybe the answer is B, but with some nuance. The key is whether the author was wrong in their reaction. Since they later apologized and tried to fix things, perhaps the answer is B.\n"
