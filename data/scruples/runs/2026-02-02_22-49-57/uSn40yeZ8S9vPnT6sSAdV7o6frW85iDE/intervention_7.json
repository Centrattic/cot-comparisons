My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author sells items on eBay and had an auction for Supreme cough drops. The sister ate them, not knowing their value. The author was upset because they had a profit of $35 from the sale. They yelled at the sister, leading to the sister going back to college and not talking since.\n\nThe author feels bad and later apologizes, deciding not to make the sister pay. They also contacted the buyer and got a 3-star review. So, the question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author might have overreacted by yelling over an honest mistake. The sister didn't know the value, so eating them wasn't malicious. Yelling could have been an excessive response. Also, the author's actions caused a rift in their relationship, which seems worse than the financial loss.\n\nOn the other hand, the author put in effort to sell the item and had a legitimate expectation to deliver it. The $35 profit isn't negligible. The sister's action did cause a problem with the buyer. However, the author did take steps to resolve it by apologizing and not making the sister pay, showing they recognized the mistake.\n\nThe key points are: Was the yelling justified? Did the author have a right to be upset about the lost item? The sister's mistake was honest, but the author's emotional response was intense. However, the author's actions led to a resolution, so maybe they aren't entirely in the wrong. But they did overreact.\n\nHmm. The answer might depend on whether the reaction was disproportionate. Since the sister didn't intend harm and the author's response caused a bigger issue, maybe the author is in the wrong. But their explanation shows they felt wronged because the item was part of their income. It's a bit of a gray area. Considering the sister's perspective, the author's anger over something not intentionally taken might be seen as harsh. So, leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because it's a misunderstanding and the author did make amends, but some might argue A (in the wrong) for overreacting.\n"
