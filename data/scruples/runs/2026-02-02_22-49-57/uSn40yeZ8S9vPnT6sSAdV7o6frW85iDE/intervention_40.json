My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The sister ate them without knowing their value. The author is feeling bad and had to visit her to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the author sold the cough drops for $45, which was a significant profit. The sister ate them by mistake, not knowing their value. The author yelled, causing a rift, but later apologized and resolved it.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the sister didn't intentionally take the item meant for sale. The author's reaction was out of proportion to the sister's mistake. Even though the item had monetary value, the sister's action wasn't malicious. The author's yelling might have been excessive, especially since it led to the sister leaving and not talking for a while. However, the author did take steps to fix the situation by apologizing and not making the sister pay. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had a legitimate reason to be upset because they were expecting to sell the item and made a profit. But maybe the emotional response was too harsh given the sister's innocence. The problem here is balancing the financial loss with the personal relationship. The sister's mistake was honest, so the author might have overreacted. \n\nBut the author is also taking responsibility now, which is good. So the main question is whether the initial reaction was wrong. In terms of right and wrong, maybe the yelling was wrong because the sister didn't know about the value, so the author should have been more understanding. But the author has already made amends. Still, the initial reaction was a mistake. So answer A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no)?\n\nI think the answer is A because the author's reaction was disproportionate to the sister's honest mistake. However, some might argue that the author had a right to be upset. But the key is that the sister was unaware of the item's value, so the author should have handled it with more empathy. Hence, the author is in the wrong for yelling.\n"
