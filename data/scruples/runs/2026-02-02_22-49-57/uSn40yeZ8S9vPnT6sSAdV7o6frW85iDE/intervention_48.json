My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that they were selling on eBay for $45. The sister ate them, not knowing their value, and the author felt wronged because they made a profit from them. The sister then went back to college and didn't talk to them since. The author later apologized but the sister was upset about the yelling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a right to be upset because they were selling the item and someone else consumed it, which caused a problem with the sale. However, the way they reacted by yelling might have been excessive. The sister didn't know the value of the cough drops, so she didn't intend to steal or be malicious. The author's reaction caused a rift in their relationship, which seems more significant than the monetary value involved. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while the sister did something that caused financial loss unintentionally, the author's response of yelling and making the sister leave might have been too harsh. The key factors here are intent and proportionality. The sister's action was an honest mistake, and the author's reaction led to a lasting conflict. The author later took steps to fix it by apologizing, which shows they realized their mistake. \n\nSo, while the sister was at fault for eating the cough drops, the author's response was disproportionate. The main issue is whether the yelling was justified. Since the sister didn't know the drops were for sale and the author's reaction caused a bigger problem, the author is partly in the wrong for how they handled the situation. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
