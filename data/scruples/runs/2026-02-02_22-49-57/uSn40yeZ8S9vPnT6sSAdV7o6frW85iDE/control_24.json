My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over cough drops that were sold for $45. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author sells items on eBay. They had an auction for Supreme cough drops, which sold for $45, giving them a $35 profit. The sister ate the cough drops, unaware of their value. The author found out, yelled at her, and now the sister hasn't spoken to them since. The author later apologized and drove to her college to make amends.\n\nSo, the main points here. The sister didn't know the value of the item, right? She ate them because she liked the taste. The author, on the other hand, was selling them and had a financial stake in them. The emotional response was yelling, which caused a rift. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, maybe. Because while the cough drops were valuable to the author, the sister didn't know. The author's reaction of yelling might have been excessive. However, the author did take responsibility by apologizing and making an effort to reconcile. \n\nBut the question is about whether they were in the wrong. The sister's action was innocent, but the author's reaction led to a breakdown in their relationship. The key here is whether the author overreacted. Yelling at a family member over a mistake they didn't know about could be seen as the author's fault. \n\nAlso, the author later admitted that it wasn't worth it for $35, which shows they recognized their own possible mistake. The resolution where they apologized and the sister's perspective being that the author was being mean over cough drops suggests that the author's response was not proportional. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be at fault for overreacting, even though the situation had a financial element. The sister's mistake was innocent, and the author's yelling caused more harm than necessary. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
