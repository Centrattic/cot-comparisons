My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The situation is about the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that were part of an eBay auction they were running. The author ended up with a $45 sale, made $35 profit, but the sister ate them, leading to yelling and the sister leaving. Now they're feeling bad and tried to make amends.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the author's actions were unjustified. So, the key points here are: the sister ate the cough drops without knowing they were for sale. The author was upset because of the money involved, but maybe they overreacted.\n\nThe author bought and sold items on eBay, which suggests that the cough drops had some value to them. The sister didn't know the price or the significance of the item. The author's reaction was yelling, which might be excessive for a mistake, especially since it's a family member. The sister's perspective is important here\u2014she didn't intend to harm the author's business. \n\nIn many cases, honest mistakes like this, especially among family, are handled with understanding. The author could have been upset about the lost profit but yelling and causing a rift might be too harsh. The fact that the author later apologized and tried to fix things shows they realized their mistake. Also, the sister might not have known the value of the item since it's a \"supreme\" brand, which could be a niche or designer product that others aren't familiar with. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author did overreact. The sister made an honest mistake, and the author's response was disproportionate. The fact that they went to apologize and set ground rules suggests they took responsibility. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they yelled over an honest mistake and caused unnecessary conflict.\n"
