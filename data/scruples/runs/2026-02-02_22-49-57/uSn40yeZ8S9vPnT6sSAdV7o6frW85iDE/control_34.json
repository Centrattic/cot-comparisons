My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation involves the sister eating the cough drops, which the author had put up for auction and sold for $45, making a $35 profit. The sister went back to college and hasn't talked since.\n\nFirst, the author's main point is that they were upset about losing the item they were selling, which had monetary value. They confronted the sister, yelled at her, and the sister left. The author later realizes it wasn't worth the money and decides to apologize.\n\nLooking at the factors: The sister didn't know the value of the cough drops, as she just liked the taste. The author didn't mention the item's value beforehand. The sister's action was an honest mistake. The author's reaction was yelling, which escalated the situation. Even though the author apologized and took responsibility, the initial reaction was harsh for a mistake that wasn't intentional.\n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. The sister didn't steal; she genuinely didn't know the item's value. The author's reaction was overly harsh given the circumstances. While the author tried to make amends, the initial response was inconsiderate of the sister's perspective. So, the author is in the wrong because their reaction was disproportionate to the mistake.\n"
