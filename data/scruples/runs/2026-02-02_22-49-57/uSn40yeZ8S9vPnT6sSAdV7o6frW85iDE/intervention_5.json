My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for yelling at their sister for eating cough drops they were selling for $45. The sister ended up going back to college and hasn't talked to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author spent time and effort listing the item on eBay, which took time and effort. They made a $35 profit, which isn't a huge amount, but to them it might be significant. The sister, on the other hand, didn't realize the cough drops were valuable and ate them. She might not have known about the eBay listing or the brand (Supreme, which is a high-end brand, so maybe the logo was on the drops, making them limited edition or something?).\n\nThe author lost the item and had to deal with the buyer, who gave a 3-star review. The author felt bad about yelling and later apologized, which shows they regret the way they handled it. The sister's reaction was to leave, which might be because she was hurt by the yelling, especially over something she didn't realize was valuable.\n\nSo, was the author justified? On one hand, losing a $45 item is frustrating, especially if they had to put effort into selling it. On the other hand, yelling at a sibling for an honest mistake might be excessive. The sister didn't act with malice; she just liked the taste. The author could have handled it more calmly. However, the author did take responsibility by apologizing later, which is a positive step. The fact that they made a profit and the sister didn't know the value might mean the author overreacted. But maybe the stress of losing the item and the potential conflict with the buyer made them lose their temper. \n\nConsidering all factors, the sister's mistake was honest, and the author's reaction was harsh given the circumstances. The author could have been more understanding. So, maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn because the sister didn't act with intent. However, the value was due to the brand and the eBay sale, which the sister wasn't aware of. The author might need to have taken the time to explain the situation rather than yelling. So leaning towards A, but not entirely sure.\n"
