My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author sells designer items on eBay, and they had a cough drop that sold for $45, with $35 profit. They couldn't find the item and later found out their sister ate them. The author yelled at her, and now she hasn't talked to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the value of the item. It was a $45 item, which the author made $35 profit on. That's not a huge amount, but if you're into eBay selling, every bit counts. However, the sister didn't know the value of the item, which the author mentions in Edit 2. She just liked the taste. So maybe she didn't realize what she was doing.\n\nThe author yelled at her. Yelling is a strong reaction, especially over something that, in the sister's eyes, seemed like just cough drops. Even if they were valuable, maybe the author should have handled it differently. The sister left the next day, which suggests she was really hurt by the yelling. The author later apologized and went to see her, which shows they realized their mistake. Also, the buyer got a 3-star review, which is a consequence of the author's actions.\n\nSo, the key points are: the sister didn't know the value, the author overreacted by yelling, leading to a broken relationship. The author did apologize, but the initial reaction was harsh. It seems like the author is at least partially at fault because they didn't communicate the value beforehand and reacted with anger instead of addressing it calmly. The answer is likely A (author is in the wrong). But wait, maybe the value was important to the author's business, so they have a point. However, the way they handled it was wrong. So yes, the answer should be A.\n"
