My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author sold some designer cough drops on eBay and made a profit. Then they couldn't find them, and later found out their sister ate them. The author yelled at her, which caused the sister to go back to college and not talk to them since.\n\nFirst, the author spent time and effort to get the cough drops, maybe even bought them for reselling. They made $35 profit, which is a nice return. The sister took them without asking, thinking maybe they were just regular cough drops. The author got angry because they lost the item they were supposed to deliver to a buyer. Yelling seems like an overreaction, especially since the sister didn't know their value. The author ended up apologizing and not making her pay, which shows they realized it was a mistake. Also, the buyer was understanding but gave a 3-star review. \n\nSo, the key points here are intention. The sister didn't know the value, and the author's reaction was excessive. Even though the author had a right to be upset about losing the item, yelling and causing a rift in the family seems wrong. The author taking responsibility by apologizing and driving to see their sister shows they acknowledged their mistake. Therefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their reaction was probably too harsh. However, the sister's action (eating them without knowing) was a mistake too. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the yelling and the impact on their sister. Since the sister didn't know the value, the author's initial reaction might have been unjustified. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for overreacting, but not completely. But according to the options, it's A or B. Since the user says they think the author is not in the wrong, but I need to decide. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions (yelling) were inconsiderate, but the sister's mistake was honest. So the author took responsibility, which is positive. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a gray area. The main wrong might be the author's yelling, but the sister also had a part. However, since the question is about the author's responsibility, and the sister made an honest mistake, the author's yelling was perhaps in the wrong. Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the answer is A because the author overreacted, even if they later apologized. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the author had a right to be upset about losing the item, but yelling was wrong. So the answer could be A. But I'm still conflicted. \n\nLooking at the edits, the author took steps to make things right, so maybe the initial reaction was wrong but they corrected it. The question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they eventually apologized and took responsibility, maybe the answer is B. But the initial yelling was wrong. However, the sister's action was also a mistake. The answer is probably B because the author had the right to be upset, and the sister's mistake was honest. So, the author isn't in the wrong. But the yelling was excessive. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B. I think the author is not in the wrong because the sister made an honest mistake, and the author had a right to be upset about losing the item they were supposed to deliver. However, the yelling was a poor reaction, but not necessarily making them in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
