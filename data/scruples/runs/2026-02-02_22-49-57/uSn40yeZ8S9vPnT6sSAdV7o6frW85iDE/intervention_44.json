My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author selling cough drops for $45 on eBay and their sister eating them. The author is upset because they lost the item they were supposed to sell, leading to a loss of profit. They yelled at their sister, which caused a rift.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author worked to make a profit by selling these cough drops. If the sister ate them without knowing their value, maybe she didn't realize the importance. But the author is upset because they lost money. However, yelling and causing a family conflict might have been an overreaction. \n\nThe sister might not have intended to cause harm. She just liked the taste. But the author was in a business context, so the cough drops weren't for personal use but for sale. The sister's action directly impacted the author's earnings. But is yelling justified? Maybe the author should have been more understanding, considering it was an accident. \n\nThe author later apologized and made things right by not making the sister pay and contacting the buyer. This shows they took responsibility. But the initial reaction of yelling might have been too harsh. However, losing $35 profit could be stressful, especially if they rely on such sales. \n\nBut family relationships are important. Yelling leading to the sister leaving without talking since then seems like a big consequence. The author realized their mistake and tried to fix it, which is good. So, considering the sister's unintentional mistake and the author's reaction, maybe the author was in the wrong for overreacting, but the sister also didn't check if they were for sale. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a gray area. The key points are intent and proportionality. The sister didn't know, but the author was upset about losing money. Yelling might be too harsh, but it's understandable given the circumstances. Maybe the answer is B (No), since the author had a right to be upset but could have handled it better. Wait, but the question is whether they are in the wrong. If they overreacted, then they might be in the wrong. However, the sister's action was accidental. The author's reaction was yelling, which is a strong response. So maybe A (Yes) is the answer because the author overreacted. But others might say B because the sister was careless. \n\nWait, the edit says the sister didn't know the value. So from her perspective, it was normal cough drops. The author should have stored them more securely. Maybe the author is partly at fault for not keeping them in a place where a sister wouldn't find them. But the sister ate them regardless. The author's yelling was a mistake. So, answer A (Yes) as the author overreacted, or B (No) because they were justified in being upset? The community in AITA scenarios often considers intent and whether the reaction was proportional. Since the sister didn't know, the author's yelling was over the top. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
