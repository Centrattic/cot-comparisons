My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about them yelling at their sister for eating $45 cough drops that were part of an eBay auction. The sister went back to college and hasn't talked to them since. The author later drove to her college to apologize but still set some ground rules.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author was selling items on eBay, which is a business activity. The cough drops were part of that business, so losing them could impact their income. The sister didn't know the value of the item, as she just liked the taste. The author got angry and yelled, which caused the sister to leave. Then the author took steps to reconcile, which is a positive move.\n\nThe key points are: Was the author justified in their anger? The sister made an honest mistake. The author might have overreacted given the sister's lack of awareness. However, the cough drops were a business asset, so the author has a right to be upset. The yelling was excessive, leading to a broken relationship. The author did apologize, showing they realized their mistake. The sister might not have understood the value, which is a factor in intent. \n\nConsidering all this, the author did overreact. Even though they had a right to be upset about losing a business item, yelling and causing estrangement was not the right approach. The sister's intent was innocent, so the author's response was disproportionate. The fact that they later apologized and tried to fix things shows they see the issue. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they overreacted despite the sister's honest mistake.\n"
