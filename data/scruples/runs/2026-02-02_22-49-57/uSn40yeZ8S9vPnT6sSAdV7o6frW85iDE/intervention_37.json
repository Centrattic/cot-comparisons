My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister for eating $45 cough drops. The story says the author sells designer items on eBay, and these cough drops were part of an auction where he made $35 profit. He couldn't find them until he saw the sister had eaten them. He yelled at her, she left, and he felt bad, then went to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The cough drops were being sold, so they had real value to him. The sister might have not realized their worth. The author is upset about losing a product he was selling, which affected his profit. But the reaction was yelling, which is a strong response. The sister didn't know they were valuable, so maybe she didn't intend to steal. \n\nThe author later says he's not making her pay because it was an honest mistake. That's a good point. He took responsibility and tried to make amends. The sister's response was to leave and not talk since. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, he had a right to be upset about losing an item he was selling. On the other hand, yelling might have been excessive, especially since the sister was unaware. But he did apologize and explain. \n\nThe key factors here are intent and the subsequent actions. The sister didn't know they were valuable, so her action was accidental. The author's yelling might be seen as overreacting, but he took steps to fix the relationship. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the author should have communicated the value to his sister in the first place. However, in the heat of the moment, his emotional reaction could be understandable. The resolution where he apologizes and doesn't make her pay shows he's taking the higher ground. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because the sister made a mistake, and he addressed it by apologizing. But the initial yelling could be seen as a misstep. However, the fact that he took responsibility and made amends might tip the scales towards him not being in the wrong. The answer is probably B, No.\n"
