My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves them yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that were sold on eBay for $45, leading to the sister leaving and not talking to them since. The author later apologized and drove to her college to make things right.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points are: the author sold the cough drops for $45, their sister ate them without knowing their value, the author yelled at her, and then took steps to apologize. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The sister ate the cough drops, which the author intended to sell. The sister didn't realize their value, so it was an honest mistake. The author's reaction was yelling, which seems excessive for an honest mistake, especially over $35 profit. Yelling might have been the main issue here, leading to the sister leaving. However, the author did take responsibility by apologizing and making amends. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the sister's mistake was unintentional. The author's anger was over a material item that the sister didn't know was valuable. The value here is subjective, but yelling at a family member over a mistake, even if they valued the item highly, could be seen as disproportionate. The fact that the author later took steps to fix the situation shows they recognized their mistake. \n\nSo, the author made a mistake in their reaction but took responsibility. The sister's action was accidental. The core issue is the author's response. Yelling at a family member over an honest mistake, even if the item had value, is often seen as the wrong approach. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting, but they made amends. However, the sister also could have communicated better if she thought the items were valuable, but since she didn't know, that's not her fault. \n\nIn conclusion, while the sister made a mistake, the author's response was more harmful. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their reaction was disproportionate and caused harm, even though they later apologized.\n"
