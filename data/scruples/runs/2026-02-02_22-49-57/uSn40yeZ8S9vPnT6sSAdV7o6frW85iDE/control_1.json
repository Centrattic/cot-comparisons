My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person who sold cough drops for $45 on eBay, made a $35 profit, but then their sister ate them without knowing their value. The author yelled at their sister, leading to a rift where the sister went back to college and they haven't talked since. The author later apologized, and the sister's reaction makes sense now, but the reviewer gave a 3-star review.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of the author. The key points here are: \n\n1. The author made money from selling the cough drops, which they were using for their eBay business. Losing them might have caused a problem with the buyer.\n2. The sister ate them without knowing their value. The author didn't mention if they informed their sister about the value of the cough drops beforehand.\n3. The author reacted with yelling, which seems harsh, especially over $35 profit. The sister's response was to leave, which is a big deal.\n4. The author later apologized and tried to make amends, which shows they realized their mistake.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Yelling at a sibling over an accidental mistake, even if the item had value, might be excessive. The sister didn't know the cough drops were for sale, so she didn't intend to misappropriate them. The author's responsibility here could be in not securing the item properly or not communicating with their sister about the business. However, the sister also ate someone else's property without permission, which is her fault, but it's an honest mistake. \n\nThe author's reaction seems to be the main issue. Losing $35 is not a justification for yelling and damaging the relationship. The fact that they had to drive to apologize shows they realized their mistake. The sister's perspective was that it was overreacting, which makes sense. The reviewer's 3-star review is a consequence, but that's more about the buyer's experience with the situation.\n\nSo, the author is partially at fault for their overreaction, even if the sister made a mistake. The answer would be A (Yes) because the author's yelling and the subsequent handling of the situation contributed to the problem.\n"
