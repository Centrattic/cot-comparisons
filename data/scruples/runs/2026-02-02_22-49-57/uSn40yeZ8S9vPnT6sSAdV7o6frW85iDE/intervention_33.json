My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister for eating expensive cough drops they were selling. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author sold the cough drops for $45 on eBay, making a $35 profit. They couldn't find them until they saw their sister had eaten them. The sister didn't know their value, just liked the taste. The author yelled at her, leading to her going back to college and not talking since. The author later apologized and didn't make her pay, but got a 3-star review from the buyer.\n\nHmm. The key points here: was the author justified in their reaction? On one hand, the cough drops were sold, so losing them could affect the transaction. The sister didn't know their value, so maybe it was an honest mistake. Yelling seems harsh, especially given the high emotion and leading to a rift. The author later took steps to fix things by apologizing and contacting the buyer, which shows they realized their mistake. But initially, yelling over what the sister didn't know was valuable might be seen as overreacting. The sister's perspective is important here\u2014she didn't intend to steal or be malicious. The value was in the author's mind as a seller, but the sister had no idea. So, the author's reaction might be seen as disproportionate, hence in the wrong. But others might argue that losing a sale is a real loss. However, the emotional response and the aftermath (not talking since) suggest the author overreacted. The fact that they later apologized and made amends shows they recognized this. So the answer might be A (author in the wrong) because they overreacted, even if the item was valuable.\n"
