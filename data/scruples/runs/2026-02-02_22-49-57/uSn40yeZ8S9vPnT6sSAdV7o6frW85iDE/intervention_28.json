My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. So first, the situation: the author sells items on eBay, and these cough drops were part of a sale. They ended up making $35 profit. The sister ate them, and the author got angry. The sister left, and they're now estranged.\n\nHmm. The author's perspective is that they invested time and effort into selling these items, which turned into a profit. So losing the item the sister ate disrupted that. The sister didn't realize the value, maybe didn't know they were for sale. The author's reaction was yelling, which led to the sister going back to college and not talking since. The author later apologized and went to visit, but the sister had a different view of the situation.\n\nNow, considering the sister's side: maybe she didn't know the cough drops were valuable. If they were just regular cough drops, she might not have thought twice about eating them. The author, however, saw them as part of their business. There's a communication gap here. The author didn't explain the item's importance beforehand, leading to the sister's misunderstanding.\n\nWas yelling the right response? It's understandable that the author was upset about losing a profit-making item, but the reaction might have been too harsh. The sister's action was an honest mistake, not intentional theft. The author's anger could have been proportional to the situation. Yelling might have been an overreaction, especially since the item was consumed accidentally. The author later took steps to apologize, which shows they recognized the severity of their reaction.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have some. The author should have communicated the importance of the item in their business. The sister, while not malicious, should have asked if unsure. However, the author's response of yelling and causing a rift might have been the immediate problem. The fact that the author went to apologize and made amends is a positive, but the initial reaction could be seen as wrong because it was excessive given the sister's lack of intent.\n"
