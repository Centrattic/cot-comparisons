My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about them yelling at their sister for eating their $45 cough drops. The author feels bad because their sister hasn't talked to them since and they went to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author sells items on eBay, and the cough drops were part of that. The sister ate them without knowing they were valuable. The author got angry and yelled, leading to the sister returning to college and cutting off communication. Then the author realizes it wasn't worth the money and goes to apologize.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the sister didn't know the value, the author's reaction might have been disproportionate, and the author later takes responsibility by apologizing. \n\nThe sister's action was accidental, so she didn't intend to steal. The author was selling them, so losing that item means losing a sale. However, 35 dollars profit isn't that much, and yelling led to a strained relationship. The author then took steps to make amends, which is a good sign.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The sister didn't know, so the author's immediate reaction was to yell, which could be seen as overreacting. The value of the item is high, but the sister's mistake was honest. The author did apologize and tried to resolve it, but the initial action of yelling might be where the fault lies. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author could have been more understanding. The sister might not have known they were valuable, so the onus could be on the author to secure their items better. However, the sister's action was careless. \n\nBut since the author was selling them, maybe they didn't expect the sister to consume them. However, the way they reacted was harsh. The sister had no malicious intent. The author's reaction might have been inappropriate given the circumstances, but they did make amends. \n\nIn the end, the author is in the middle. They had a valid reason (losing a sale) but the reaction was excessive. The sister's mistake was honest. The author's wrong was in the yelling and not handling it more calmly. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
