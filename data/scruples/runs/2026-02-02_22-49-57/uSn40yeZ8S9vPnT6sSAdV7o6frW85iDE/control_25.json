My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for yelling at their sister for eating $45 cough drops. The situation involves the sister eating something that the author had intended to sell on eBay, which they had listed for $45 and made a $35 profit on.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a buyer/seller on eBay, and the cough drops were part of their inventory. The sister ate them without realizing their value, perhaps because she didn't see the brand (like the Supreme logo mentioned). The author found out, confronted her, yelled at her, and their sister left for college and hasn't talked to them since. The author later drove to her college to apologize, set some boundaries, and decided not to make her pay for the loss.\n\nNow, considering the elements of the story. The sister's actions were unintentional. She ate something she thought was just regular cough drops. The author, on the other hand, had a specific intent to sell them, which is a business activity. The sister's actions, while careless, were not malicious. The author's reaction was to yell, which seems excessive given the sister's intent, even if the item had value. The author later took steps to make amends, which shows some level of understanding that their reaction was too harsh.\n\nThe value of the item is $45, which is not a trivial amount, but the sister's mistake was in not recognizing the product. The author's anger and subsequent yelling might have been disproportionate. The sister left and didn't communicate, but that could be due to feeling upset by the confrontation. The author's realization that they were being mean and their effort to apologize and set rules indicates that they saw their own fault.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the sister made a mistake, but the author's response was harsh. While the author has a right to be upset about losing a $45 item, yelling and causing a rift with the sister over a mistake is typically seen as the wrong approach. The sister's intent wasn't to steal or harm the author's business, so the author's anger was misplaced.\n\nLooking at the edits, the author took responsibility by apologizing and not making the sister pay, which suggests that the author realized their error in handling the situation. However, the initial reaction of yelling is what caused the problem. The key factor here is that the sister's action was innocent, and the author's reaction was too severe. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for overreacting.\n"
