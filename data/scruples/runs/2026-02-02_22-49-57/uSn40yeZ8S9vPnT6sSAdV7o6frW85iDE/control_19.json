My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that the author had sold for $45 on eBay. The sister then went back to college and didn't talk to the author since.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author sells items on eBay, including these designer cough drops. An auction went up to $45, and the author made a $35 profit. The sister ate them without realizing their value. The author yelled at her, leading to the sister leaving and not communicating. The author later apologized and went to her college to make amends, but the buyer gave a 3-star review.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The sister didn't know the drops were for sale, so she ate them. The author was upset about losing $35, but the reaction was yelling and causing a rift. Was it reasonable for the author to react that way? Maybe not. The sister didn't intend to take them; it was an honest mistake. The author didn't mention the value to her, so she had no reason to know. Yelling over a mistake, even if it's your property, might be excessive. The author later apologized and tried to fix things, which shows they realized the mistake. But the initial reaction was harsh. So, the author is probably in the wrong for overreacting. But the sister's action was accidental. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they overreacted and hurt their sister's feelings. But some might argue that the author had a right to be upset about losing money. Hmm. The key points are intent and proportionality. The sister didn't know, so the author should have been more understanding. Yelling was an overreaction. So, the answer is A.\n"
