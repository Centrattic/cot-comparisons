My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that were sold on eBay for $45, leading to the sister going back to college and not talking since.\n\nFirst, the sister ate the cough drops because she liked the taste. She didn't know their value since they were designer or part of an eBay auction. The author was upset because they made $35 profit, which they considered significant. They yelled, which caused the sister to leave. Later, the author drove to her college, apologized, and they reconciled but the author still had a 3-star review from the buyer.\n\nSo, the main points are: Did the author overreact? Was the sister at fault? The sister made a mistake, but the author's reaction was yelling, which led to a big fallout. The author later took steps to make amends, which shows they realized the mistake. The sister didn't know the value, so she didn't intend to steal. The author's anger over $35 might be seen as disproportionate, especially causing a rift with a family member. The answer is likely A because the author was in the wrong for overreacting, even though they made amends later. But wait, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The sister's mistake was unintentional, so the author's yelling was unjustified. Yeah, A makes sense here.\n"
