My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister for eating $45 cough drops. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author sold the cough drops for $45, making a $35 profit. That seems high for cough drops, so maybe they were a limited or designer edition? The sister ate them without realizing their value. The author felt wronged and yelled at her, which led to the sister leaving and not talking since.\n\nOn one hand, the sister made a mistake, not intentionally stealing. She might not have known they were valuable, especially if the brand (Supreme) is on them and she didn't see the logo. The author took time and effort to sell them, so losing the item they were selling for profit could be frustrating. Yelling might have been an overreaction, given the high value and the emotional impact of losing the sale. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister didn't know the drops were for sale. If the box was mangled on her dresser, maybe the author didn't store them securely. The value here is $45, which isn't trivial, but is it worth yelling at a family member over? The author later apologized and tried to rebuild the relationship, which is a good step. The sister's reaction of leaving and not talking since might be exaggerated, but it's possible she felt hurt by the yelling.\n\nThe key points are intention, reaction proportionality, and resolution. The sister's action was accidental, but the author's yelling might have been too harsh compared to the situation. However, the value of the item could justify some level of frustration. The author made an effort to reconcile, which shows they didn't think they were entirely in the right. \n\nBut in terms of being in the wrong, the author's anger and yelling over a family member's mistake, especially without prior communication about the item's value, might make them at fault. The sister didn't know, and yelling damaged their relationship. So maybe the answer is A (Yes), but I need to check if the high value justifies the reaction. Since the author later apologized and the sister didn't know, the initial yelling could be seen as overreacting.\n"
