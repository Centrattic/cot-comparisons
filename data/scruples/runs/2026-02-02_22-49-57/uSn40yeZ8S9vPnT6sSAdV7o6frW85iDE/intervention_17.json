My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author sold some cough drops for $45, but their sister ate them, leading to an argument and the sister going back to college. The author ended up apologizing and driving to her college to make amends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author spent time and effort selling the item, which had a profit involved. The sister, on the other hand, might not have realized the value of the cough drops, especially if there was a brand involved like Supreme. The author's reaction was to yell, which escalated the situation. But the sister eating them could be an honest mistake.\n\nThe key points here are intent and the response. The sister didn't know the value, so it's an honest mistake. The author's reaction was yelling, which might be excessive given the sister's lack of intent. However, the author did take the initiative to apologize and resolve the issue, which shows responsibility. The sister not talking since then might be because of the sudden argument and the impact of being yelled at.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while the sister made a mistake, the author's yelling could be seen as overreacting. The author could have handled it in a calmer manner. However, the follow-up actions\u2014apologizing and not making the sister pay\u2014show that the author recognizes the mistake in their reaction. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but maybe partially. The sister's ignorance of the item's value also plays a role. The main question is whether the author's response was disproportionate. Since the sister didn't know the value, the author's anger might not be justified. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong, but there's nuance. However, in terms of being in the wrong, the yelling over an honest mistake might make the author at least partially at fault. But the sister's responsibility is also there. The answer might depend on cultural norms, but generally, the author's reaction was harsh. So the answer could be A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Given the edits where the author apologizes and the sister's perspective is considered, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
