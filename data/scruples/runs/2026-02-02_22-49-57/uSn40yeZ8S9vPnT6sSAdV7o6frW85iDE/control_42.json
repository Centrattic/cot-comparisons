My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was selling some Supreme cough drops on eBay, which they got for $10 and sold for $45, making a $35 profit. They couldn't find the item and found out their sister had eaten them. The author yelled at her, and now the sister is upset and hasn't talked to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the value of the item. The author probably thought these cough drops were valuable, maybe because they were a collectible item or had a brand like Supreme, which is a streetwear brand. But cough drops are usually not valuable unless they're rare or have some special edition. So maybe the sister didn't realize their worth because they're just cough drops in appearance. That could be a point\u2014she might not have known they were valuable.\n\nThen, the author yelled at her. Yelling is generally considered aggressive and can be hurtful. The sister's reaction was to leave, which suggests she felt really upset. The author later realizes it wasn't worth it for $35 and decides to apologize. That shows some self-awareness.\n\nThe key points here are whether the sister knew the item was valuable and if the author's reaction was disproportionate. If the sister had no idea they were valuable, then the author's anger might have been overreacting. Also, the author made a profit, so they didn't lose money, but maybe the emotional impact on the sister was worse.\n\nThe author took steps to fix it by apologizing and setting boundaries, which is good. However, the initial response of yelling was probably the main issue. The sister's mistake was honest, so the author should have handled it calmly instead of yelling. So, the author is at fault for overreacting and causing a rift in their relationship over a misunderstanding.\n"
