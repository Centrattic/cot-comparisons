My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for yelling at their sister for eating their $45 cough drops. \n\nFirst, the context: The writer sells items on eBay and had a Supreme cough drop on auction that sold for $45. The sister ate them without knowing their value, and the writer yelled at her, leading to a fallout. The sister went back to college and didn't talk to the writer since.\n\nThe key points here are intent and reaction. The sister didn't know the value of the cough drops\u2014she just liked the taste. The writer, on the other hand, was upset about losing $35 profit. Yelling and causing a rift over an honest mistake might be seen as an overreaction. \n\nThe writer later apologized and tried to make things right by visiting the sister and explaining. The sister's perspective is important here; she didn't intend to harm, so the writer's initial reaction was harsh. \n\nBut is the writer in the wrong? Well, they didn't mean to cause harm, but their response was extreme. Mistakes happen, and while the cough drops had value, the sister's ignorance of their worth is a factor. The writer could have handled it more calmly, maybe educating the sister instead of yelling. \n\nSo, considering that the sister's action was unintentional and the writer's reaction led to a significant conflict, the answer leans towards the writer being in the wrong. They could have resolved it without yelling. The fact that they apologized and made amends shows they realize it, but initially, their reaction was disproportionate.\n"
