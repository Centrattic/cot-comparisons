My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about yelling at their sister for eating cough drops they were selling on eBay. The cough drops sold for $45, making a $35 profit. The sister ate them without knowing their value, and the author yelled, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a legitimate financial loss here. They worked to make money through their eBay business, and losing the item they were supposed to sell is a valid concern. The profit was significant, $35, which might not seem like a lot to some, but if the author is saving up or this is part of their income, it's understandable to be upset.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister ate the cough drops, which she might not have realized were valuable. She didn't intentionally steal them. The author had them in their closet, which isn't a very secure place, and maybe they should have kept them more safely. The author's reaction was yelling, which might have been excessive, especially since it led to the sister leaving and not talking since. Emotional harm is a factor here too.\n\nThe author did apologize and tried to make amends by driving to the sister's college, which shows they feel guilty. The sister's perspective is that the author was being overly harsh for something she didn't know was valuable. The author also didn't make the sister pay, acknowledging it was an honest mistake.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's anger is somewhat justified because they lost money. However, the way they handled it\u2014yelling and causing a rift\u2014might be inconsiderate. The sister's mistake was innocent, so the author could have handled it more calmly. The key point is whether the author's reaction was disproportionate. Since the sister didn't know the value, the author should have considered that in their response.\n\nSo, the answer is a bit nuanced. The author isn't entirely wrong because they have a financial stake, but their reaction was perhaps too harsh given the sister's lack of intent. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for overreacting.\n"
