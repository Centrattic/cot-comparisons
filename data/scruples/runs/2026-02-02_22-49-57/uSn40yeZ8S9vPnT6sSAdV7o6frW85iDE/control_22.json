My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author made money selling cough drops on eBay, and their sister ate them thinking they were regular ones. The author got really mad, yelled, and now their sister is upset and hasn't talked to them since. \n\nFirst, the author did sell the cough drops for $45, which they were probably excited about because it was a good profit. The sister didn't know they were valuable, just ate them because she liked the taste. The author found them missing, looked everywhere, then saw them in the sister's room. Confronted her, got angry, yelled, and the sister left. Then the author feels bad, went to apologize but also set some rules. The buyer gave a 3-star review after the situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The sister made a mistake, not on purpose. The author was selling them, so they were meant to be sold, not eaten. But maybe the sister didn't know the value. The author's reaction was yelling, which might be excessive for a mistake. The sister left, which shows she was hurt. The author later took steps to fix it by apologizing and not making the sister pay. \n\nOn one hand, the author had a right to be upset because they were trying to make a sale and lost money. But on the other, the sister didn't know, and the author's reaction was harsh. The key is whether the author's response was proportional. Yelling and causing a rift over a mistake, even if it affected their business, might be too much. The fact that the author later took steps to fix it suggests they realized the mistake. So, the initial reaction might be in the wrong, but they tried to make amends. So likely the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the initial reaction was too harsh, even if they fixed it later."
