My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is upset because their sister ate a $45 cough drop they were selling on eBay. They bought and sold designer items, and the cough drops were part of that. The sister didn't know their value and ate them, leading to a yelling incident and the sister leaving. The author later apologized but got a 3-star review from the buyer.\n\nFirst, the sister's action was an honest mistake. She didn't know the drops were valuable, just liked the taste. The author had a right to be upset about losing the profit, but yelling and causing a rift might have been excessive. The author took responsibility by apologizing and not making the sister pay, which shows they recognized their own harshness. The buyer's review was understanding but still a 3-star, which the author has to accept.\n\nThe key points are intent and proportionality. The sister didn't intentionally steal; she made a mistake. The author's reaction was strong but led to reconciliation. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because the item was their property, but the way they handled it could be seen as overreacting. However, they took steps to correct their behavior. So, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they overreacted, but the sister's mistake was honest. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because they owned the item and had a right to be upset. Need to weigh both sides. The sister's lack of knowledge and the author's eventual apology suggest the author's initial reaction was the bigger issue. So, likely A.\n"
