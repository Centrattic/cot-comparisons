My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that were sold for $45. The sister went back to college and they haven't talked since. The author later apologized and went to see her, but the sister's perspective was that it was just normal cough drops.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author spent time and effort to get those cough drops to sell, made a profit, and felt violated when the sister ate them. They were justified in being upset because their property was taken without permission. However, the way they reacted was to yell, which might have been the main issue. Yelling can be perceived as harsh, especially over something the sister didn't realize was valuable. The sister didn't know the cough drops were part of the eBay auction, so she might not have intended to steal or harm her brother. \n\nThe author did take responsibility by apologizing and clarifying their mistake, which shows they recognized the emotional impact of their reaction. The sister's response to the situation (leaving and not communicating) might have been her way of dealing with the conflict, but that's on her side. The key point here is whether the author's reaction was proportionate. Yelling in anger could have been unnecessary given the sister's lack of intent. However, the author had a right to be upset about the loss of property. \n\nThe resolution the author took\u2014apologizing and not making the sister pay\u2014demonstrates understanding. So, while the author had a legitimate reason to be upset, the yelling might have been excessive. On the other hand, the sister's mistake doesn't excuse the damage done, but the author's reaction could have been more measured. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But the main fault lies with the sister for eating the items without knowing, but the author's yelling might have been the immediate problem. However, since the author took steps to make amends, maybe the blame isn't entirely on them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. Considering the sister's perspective and the author's reaction, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they had a reason to be upset, even if their reaction was harsh. But the yelling could be seen as the issue here. Alternatively, given that the sister didn't know the value, the author's reaction might have been too strong. \n\nHmm. The key is whether the yelling was justified. The author lost $35 profit, which might not be a huge amount, but it's their effort. Yelling over that could be seen as disproportionate. However, the sister's action was accidental. The author's initial reaction was anger, which might not be the best approach. So, while the author had a right to be upset, the way they handled it was the problem. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for yelling. But then again, the sister ate the item, which is someone's property. It's a tough call. \n\nIn the end, the author did apologize and make things right, which shows they realized their reaction might have been too harsh. So maybe the author is not in the wrong because they took responsibility. The sister's mistake was the root cause. So the answer could be B (No) because the author isn't entirely at fault, especially after correcting their mistake.\n"
