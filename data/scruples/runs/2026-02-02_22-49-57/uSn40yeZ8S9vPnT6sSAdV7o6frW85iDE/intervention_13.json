My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is upset because their sister ate $45 cough drops that were part of an eBay auction. They made a $35 profit, which the sister unknowingly destroyed by eating them. The author yelled at her, and the sister left for college and didn't talk to them since.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to sell the item they owned. The sister consumed what was intended for sale. The author's frustration over losing that profit is understandable, especially since they worked to make that money. However, the way they reacted\u2014yelling\u2014might be seen as excessive given the situation. \n\nBut the sister didn't know the value or the intended use of the cough drops. She ate them because she liked the taste. The author didn't inform her about the eBay listing, so the sister had no idea she was damaging the item. In that case, the author might be partially at fault for not communicating clearly.\n\nHowever, the sister also took and consumed something that wasn't hers without permission. Even if it's a mistake, it's still taking someone else's property. The author has the right to be upset about losing the item they were going to sell. The emotional reaction (yelling) could be seen as harsh, but the situation itself isn't entirely the author's fault.\n\nThe author took responsibility by apologizing and making an effort to fix things, which is a good step. The sister's reaction (leaving) might be overreacting, but the situation is tense. The key points are that the sister made an honest mistake, the author didn't clarify the importance of the item, and the reaction was strong but maybe not entirely wrong given the investment of time and money.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the sister did take something not hers. But the author could have handled it better without yelling. However, the initial act of selling and the sister's mistake play a role. In terms of the question, whether the author is in the wrong, it's a judgment call. Since the sister didn't know, the author's anger might be justified in part, but the yelling could be seen as over the top. But overall, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the sister's action was a mistake, and the author had a right to be upset about losing the item they intended to sell.\n"
