My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was selling some designer cough drops on eBay for $45, made a $35 profit, but then their sister ate them thinking they were normal cough drops. The author got really upset, yelled at her sister, and now they haven't talked since. The author later went to apologize, set some boundaries, and the sister didn't know they were valuable.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author was selling these cough drops, probably as part of a resale business. They might have been rare or branded, hence the high price. The sister didn't realize their value and consumed them. The author was clearly upset because they lost the item they were selling, leading to a financial loss and a damaged relationship.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they had a legitimate expectation that the item would be there when the buyer came to collect it. The sister's action caused a problem, so the author felt justified in being angry. However, the author's reaction involved yelling, which escalated the situation. The sister left for college and they stopped talking, which shows the impact of the author's outburst.\n\nNow, considering if the author is at fault. On one hand, the sister made a mistake, not knowing the item's value. On the other hand, the author's response was harsh. Yelling is a strong reaction, especially over an item that, while valuable monetarily, isn't essential. The author later apologized, which indicates they realized their reaction was excessive. The sister's perspective matters here\u2014she didn't intentionally harm the author, just didn't understand the item's significance.\n\nThe author could have handled it differently. Instead of yelling, they might have explained the situation calmly, set boundaries, and maybe even educated the sister on the value of the items. The fact that the author went to apologize and tried to mend things is a positive step, but the initial reaction was still problematic.\n\nThe financial loss was $35, which isn't insignificant, but the emotional toll on the relationship is bigger. The author's reaction was disproportionate to the mistake, leading to a broken relationship. The sister's mistake was understandable if she didn't know the item was being sold, especially if the box was stored in their home. The author should have considered that not everyone would be aware of the items' value, especially if they were kept in a shared space.\n\nIn conclusion, while the sister made a mistake, the author's reaction was excessive. The author is in the wrong for overreacting and causing the rift. The fact that they later took steps to fix things shows they realized this. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
