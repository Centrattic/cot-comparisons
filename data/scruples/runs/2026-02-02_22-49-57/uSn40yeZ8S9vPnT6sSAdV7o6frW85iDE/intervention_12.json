My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that were for sale on eBay, which ended up making $45. The sister didn't know their value, ate them, and the author lost the money. They felt bad, went to apologize, and the sister didn't know the drops' worth.\n\nHmm. So, the author is selling items, which is a business. The cough drops were part of that business. The sister ate them without knowing they were for sale. The author got angry and yelled, leading to a fallout. Now, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know the opinion.\n\nFirst, the author's reaction: yelling and being harsh. That could be seen as overreacting. Money-wise, $45 isn't that much, and the sister didn't know the value. The author made a profit, but the item was gone. However, the sister made an honest mistake. The author took the initiative to apologize, which shows they realized their reaction was too strong.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, selling on eBay is their business, so protecting their inventory makes sense. But the sister didn't have the intent to steal. Yelling was emotional. Maybe the author should have communicated better instead of yelling. They did apologize and make amends, which is good. But the initial reaction\u2014was it wrong?\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, maybe the author's mistake was the yelling and the harshness, not the fact that they were upset about losing the item. So the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because the reaction was disproportionate, even if the item's value was high. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the business aspect justifies the anger. But considering the sister's perspective and the lack of intent to cause harm, maybe the author's reaction was wrong. So probably A.\n"
