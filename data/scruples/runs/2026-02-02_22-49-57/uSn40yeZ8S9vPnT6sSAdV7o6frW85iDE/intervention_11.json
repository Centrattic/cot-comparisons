My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that were being sold on eBay for $45, leading to the sister leaving for college and them not talking since. The author later apologizes and decides not to make the sister pay because it was an honest mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The cough drops were part of a business venture on eBay, and the sister ate them without realizing their value. The author got angry, yelled, and that caused the sister to leave. The author later tried to make amends by apologizing and not making the sister pay, but the buyer gave a 3-star review.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants others' opinions. So, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the sister did take something without knowing it was valuable. The author worked hard to make profit and was upset about losing the item. Yelling was a strong reaction, but maybe understandable if the item was important for their business.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister didn't intend to steal. She might not have known the cough drops were for sale or their actual value. The author's reaction was out of proportion to the sister's mistake, leading to a strained relationship. The author's apology and not making the sister pay shows they recognized the sister's mistake wasn't malicious. However, the initial yelling caused the rift.\n\nBut in the end, the author took responsibility by apologizing and handling the buyer situation. The sister's perspective is that it was just cough drops, so the author's anger might have been overreacting. The value of the item and the business aspect might justify the author's feelings, but the way they handled it could have been better. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They had a right to be upset about losing a valuable item, but the way they expressed it was harsh. The sister's mistake was honest, so the author might have been too quick to yell. But since they later apologized and understood the sister's perspective, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural norms or family dynamics, but based on the given info, the author might have acted in the moment without considering the sister's lack of intent. So maybe the answer is A, they are in the wrong for yelling, but the user's own reasoning says they aren't. Wait, the user's own thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. Hmm. But in reality, even if the item was valuable, yelling at a family member over a mistake that wasn't intentional could be seen as wrong. The sister didn't know they were for sale or their worth. The author's reaction was harsh and led to the sister leaving, which seems excessive. So, the author might be in the wrong for the yelling. But the user is leaning towards B. I need to make sure. Let me think again. The author made a business purchase, and the sister took them by accident. The author's anger is about losing money, but the sister had no malicious intent. Yelling over an honest mistake, even if the item is valuable, can be seen as overreacting. The author's actions caused the sister to leave and not communicate, which is a significant consequence. However, the author did apologize and take steps to fix the relationship. In AITA scenarios, intention and consequences matter. The sister's action was unintentional, and the author's response, while understandable in terms of the loss, was not proportionate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the yelling. So, the answer would be A. But I need to make sure. Let me check again. The cough drops were for sale, and the sister didn't know. The author was in the right to be upset about the loss, but the way they handled it by yelling was inappropriate. So, the author is partially wrong. However, the sister's actions were not malicious. So, in the end, maybe the author is in the wrong for the yelling, even if they had a reason. Because yelling can be seen as a harsh reaction regardless of the reason. So answer A.\n"
