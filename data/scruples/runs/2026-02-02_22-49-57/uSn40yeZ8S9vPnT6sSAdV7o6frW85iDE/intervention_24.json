My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about them yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that were part of an eBay auction where they sold for $45. The key points here are the value of the item, the sister's actions, and the response of the writer.\n\nFirst, the cough drops were sold on eBay for $45, which the writer considered valuable. The sister ate them without knowing their worth, probably because she didn't see the brand or logo. The writer got angry and yelled, leading to a rift in their relationship. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. From the writer's side, they worked to make a profit and lost money because the sister consumed the item. From the sister's side, she might not have known the item was valuable. The writer's reaction was yelling, which seems harsh, but maybe they were frustrated. However, they later apologized and tried to make things right by visiting her. \n\nThe sister didn't intentionally take the item, so she made an honest mistake. The writer's anger over $35 profit might be disproportionate, but the emotional value of the item (since it was sold) could add to the frustration. The fact that they reconciled and the sister didn't know the item's value might tip the scale. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the sister's mistake was unintentional. The writer's yelling could be seen as overreacting, but they took steps to fix the relationship. Maybe the writer isn't entirely in the wrong because they were protecting their property, but their response could have been better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the sister's mistake was honest, and the writer took steps to apologize and resolve the issue. The value of the item being part of a sale adds context to why the writer was upset. So, the answer is B.\n"
