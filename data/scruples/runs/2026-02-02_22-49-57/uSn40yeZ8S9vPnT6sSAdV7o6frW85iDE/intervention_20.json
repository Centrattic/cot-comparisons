My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author yelling at their sister for eating 45 dollar cough drops. The author made 35 dollars profit from selling them. The sister didn't know the value and ate them, leading to a big argument. The author feels bad and tried to make amends by apologizing and not making the sister pay. \n\nFirst, the author's actions. They were angry and yelled, which escalated the situation. Yelling can be seen as aggressive and might have contributed to the sister leaving. The emotional impact is important here\u2014maybe the sister felt attacked, especially if she didn't realize the value. The author made money from selling them, but the sister's mistake was not on purpose. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had a legitimate reason to be upset about losing an item they sold for profit. The sister's action, while unintentional, did cause a financial loss. The author's reaction was intense, though. The key is whether the reaction was proportionate. Yelling and causing the sister to leave home might be more than the situation warranted. \n\nThe author later apologized and tried to fix things, which shows they regret their actions. The sister's perspective, as the author mentions, is that the incident seemed overblown. The fact that the sister didn't know the value of the cough drops makes it an honest mistake. The author's initial response might have been too harsh given that. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be partly at fault for overreacting. Even though they had a reason to be upset, yelling and causing a lasting rift could be seen as their fault. But maybe not entirely in the wrong, since they acted out of a sense of loss. But the way they handled it is questionable. The answer could be A (yes, in the wrong) because the reaction was disproportionate, or B (not in the wrong) because the situation had a basis. Hmm. I think the answer is A, because while they had a reason to be upset, the way they handled it was wrong.\n"
