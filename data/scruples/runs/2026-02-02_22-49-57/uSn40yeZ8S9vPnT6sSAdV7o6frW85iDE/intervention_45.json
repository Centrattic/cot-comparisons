My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about yelling at a sister for eating cough drops they were selling on eBay for $45.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author probably felt wronged because they made $35 profit from the sale, and their sister ate the item they were supposed to deliver. That's a significant amount of money for something they were selling. The sister didn't realize the value because she didn't see the logo, according to her. So maybe she didn't intend to steal or be malicious.\n\nThe author yelled, which might have been an overreaction. But the sister's action directly caused a loss of income. The author tried to make amends by apologizing and not making her pay, which shows they took responsibility. The sister left and they haven't spoken since, which is a big consequence. \n\nOn the other hand, yelling at family can be seen as harsh, especially over money. However, the sister's mistake was honest. The author's anger was justified because the loss affected their business. The resolution they took was good, so maybe the initial reaction was understandable but could have been handled better.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They were upset about losing money, but their response was yelling. Maybe they should have been more calm. But considering the value and the impact on their business, maybe not. The key is whether the reaction was proportional. Yelling might have been too much, but the sister's mistake was genuine. The author also tried to fix it. \n\nHmm, I think the answer might be B (No), because the sister didn't know the value, and the author did make an effort to apologize and resolve the issue. The initial anger was due to a legitimate financial loss, but perhaps the yelling was uncalled for. However, given the context, the author's actions might not be entirely in the wrong. So leaning towards B.\n"
