My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author sold some Supreme cough drops on eBay for $45, made a $35 profit, but then their sister ate them. The author got really upset, yelled at her, and now the sister hasn't talked to them since and went back to college early. The author later went to apologize but set some rules.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author worked hard to make that money, right? Selling on eBay, especially with designer items, probably takes time and effort. The cough drops weren't just regular ones; they were Supreme, which is a brand known for being trendy and maybe even a bit of a collectible or limited edition. The sister didn't know their value and ate them. So the author felt wronged because they lost $35 profit and a product they had to deliver. \n\nBut then there's the sister's perspective. She might not have known the value of those cough drops. If they were just sitting in a box and she thought they were regular cough drops, she wouldn't know they were valuable. Eating them was an accident. The author yelled at her, which caused a big rift. The sister went back to college early, which suggests she was hurt by the argument.\n\nThe author did go back to apologize, which shows they realized they overreacted. They also didn't make the sister pay for them since it was an honest mistake. But the yelling and causing emotional harm might still be the issue. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did get upset over money and yelled at their sister. Arguably, the sister made a mistake, but yelling and causing a family rift over $35 seems excessive. The author could have handled it more calmly, maybe explained the situation without yelling. However, the sister did take the item without knowing, which the author had a right to be upset about. \n\nSo it's a bit of a gray area. But since the author took the initiative to apologize and the sister's mistake was unintentional, maybe the author's main fault was the yelling. So the answer might be A, yes, they were wrong for yelling, even though the sister was in the wrong for eating them. But I'm not sure. Maybe both have some responsibility here.\n"
