My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over 45$ cough drops. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author sells designer items on eBay and had an auction for Supreme cough drops, which sold for $45. When the time came to deliver, they couldn't find them and discovered the sister ate them. The author got angry, yelled, and the sister left, not talking since. The author later apologized and didn't make them pay, but the buyer gave a 3-star review.\n\nSo, the key points here. The cough drops were part of a business transaction. The author had a legitimate expectation to have that item available for sale. Supreme is a brand, so maybe the sister didn't recognize the value or the specific product. The author lost money and time, which is a real hit for their business. \n\nBut the sister didn't know they were for sale. The author kept them in a closet, which might not be the most accessible place, and the sister might not have known their purpose. The author's reaction was yelling, which is a strong response. The sister felt it was over a normal item and left, indicating that the emotional impact was significant. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author had the right to be upset about losing a valuable item. However, the manner of confrontation might have been harsh. The sister made a mistake, not intentionally stole. Yelling could have been an overreaction, especially considering the value to the author's business. The author later apologized, which suggests they realized their reaction was too intense. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but the yelling and the resulting fallout could be seen as their fault. The answer might be B (No), but there's nuance. The sister didn't know, but the author's reaction caused a rift. However, the author did take steps to fix it by apologizing. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the sister's action was an honest mistake, the author's yelling might have been unnecessary. Even if the item was valuable, the approach could be considered wrong because the sister didn't know they were for sale. \n\nAlternatively, the author's business is a personal venture, and the sister's consumption of items the author intended to sell could be seen as interfering with their property. But since it was a family situation, the author's response might have been too aggressive. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because they had a legitimate reason to be upset about losing a product they sold for a profit. However, the way they handled it could be improved. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the handling. So maybe the author is not in the wrong for the initial reaction, but the yelling might have been excessive. However, since the sister's actions were honest, the author's reaction could be seen as over the top, leading to the sister leaving. But the author made a mistake in how they handled it, so perhaps they are in the wrong. \n\nWait, the user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong. They might be looking for validation. The sister's mistake could be considered, but the author's anger leading to a broken relationship is a big deal. The value is 35$ profit, which is significant in a business context, but the emotional cost was higher. The author later took steps to apologize, which is good. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the sister is in the wrong for taking the item without knowing its purpose, but the author's yelling might have been the wrong approach. However, the original question is about the author's wrongdoing. The answer might be A (Yes) because the author's response was disproportionate, especially considering the sister's lack of awareness. But if the author was within their rights to be upset about lost profit, then B (No). \n\nI'm a bit torn. But the sister's mistake was unintentional, and the author's yelling could be seen as an overreaction. The author had the right to be upset but the way they expressed it was perhaps wrong. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
