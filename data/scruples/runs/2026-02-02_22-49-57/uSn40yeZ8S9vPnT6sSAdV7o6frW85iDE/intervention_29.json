My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that their sister ate cough drops that the author had bought and were part of an eBay auction, which sold for $45. The author yelled at the sister, leading to the sister leaving and not talking since. The author feels bad and is planning to apologize but is still questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The cough drops were for sale, and the sister didn't know their value or that they were for eBay. The author was upset because they made a profit, but the sister consumed them without realizing. The author's reaction was yelling, which caused the sister to leave. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sister ate the cough drops thinking they were normal. The author stored them in a shared space (closet, then sister's room) but didn't make their purpose clear. Did the author clearly communicate that these items were for sale? If not, the sister might not have known they were off-limits. The emotional response of yelling might be excessive given the sister's lack of intent to steal. The author made a profit, but the sister's action was a mistake. The author is taking steps to apologize and resolve the situation, which is a sign of understanding their possible fault.\n\nLegal or right and wrong isn't the main issue here. The main conflict is about the emotional response and communication. The author might have the right to be upset about losing the item, but yelling and causing a rift seems more about the reaction than the act itself. The sister's perspective is important too; she might feel disrespected if she didn't know the drops were for sale. The resolution where the author apologizes and the sister didn't know the value suggests that the author overreacted. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they failed to communicate the importance of the item and overreacted to an honest mistake.\n"
