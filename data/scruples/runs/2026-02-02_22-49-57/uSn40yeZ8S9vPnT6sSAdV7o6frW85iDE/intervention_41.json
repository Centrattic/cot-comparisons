My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves them yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that they were selling on eBay for $45. The sister went back to college and hasn't talked to them since. The author later apologized and made things right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author spent time and effort selling the cough drops on eBay, which is a business activity. When the sister ate them, that disrupted the author's plans and caused a financial loss. The author's anger and yelling might be seen as a reaction to a breach of trust or property. However, the sister didn't know the value of the item, which is a key point. She didn't intend to steal or cause harm; she just liked the taste.\n\nThe author's response was emotional, yelling, which can be seen as disproportionate. Even if the sister made a mistake, yelling might have been an overreaction. The sister's reaction\u2014leaving for college\u2014suggests that the author's outburst was hurtful. The author later took steps to make amends by apologizing and not making the sister pay, showing that they recognized their own harshness. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the sister's mistake was unintentional. The author's initial reaction was based on the value of the item, but the sister's perspective was that it was just cough drops. The author's yelling led to a breakdown in their relationship. However, the author did take responsibility and tried to fix things. \n\nThe key factors are intent and proportionality. The sister didn't intend harm, but the author's response was harsh. The author's actions were wrong in the way they reacted, but the sister's mistake was innocent. The resolution shows the author acknowledged their mistake. So, while the sister made an error, the author's yelling was inconsiderate and excessive. Therefore, the author is somewhat in the wrong, but maybe not entirely. However, the sister's lack of awareness and the author's subsequent apology complicate this. \n\nOverall, the author's initial reaction was inconsiderate of the sister's lack of knowledge about the item's value. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, but with mitigating factors.\n"
