My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about their sister eating cough drops that the author was selling for $45, leading to a big argument and the sister leaving. The author feels bad and ended up apologizing.\n\nFirst, the author sold the cough drops on eBay for $45, making a $35 profit. They kept them in their closet, but the sister ate them without knowing they were valuable. The author found the box in her room and yelled at her. The sister left, and the author feels guilty now.\n\nHmm. The key points here are intent and communication. The sister didn't know the value of the cough drops. The author was selling them as a designer item, maybe a brand like Supreme, which can be pricey. But the sister just ate them because she liked the taste. The author didn't mention the value to her beforehand, so maybe the sister had no way of knowing they were worth $45. \n\nThe author got angry and yelled, which caused a rift. The sister felt it was overreacting. The author later apologized, which is good, but the question is whether they were in the wrong initially. \n\nI think the author is at fault because they didn't communicate the importance of those cough drops to the sister. If they knew the sister might come into their closet or if the items are valuable for business, they should have made that clear. The sister made an honest mistake, and yelling over $35 profit seems excessive. The author should have handled it calmly, explaining the situation without yelling. The sister didn't have malicious intent, so the author's reaction was disproportionate. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
