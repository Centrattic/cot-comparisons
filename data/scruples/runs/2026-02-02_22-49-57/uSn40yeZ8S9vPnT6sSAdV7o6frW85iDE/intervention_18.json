My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their sister eating cough drops that the author sold for $45. The author felt wronged because they had actually bought the item to resell and made a profit. The sister, on the other hand, didn't know the value and ate them, thinking they were just regular cough drops.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership. Since the author owned the cough drops and sold them, they had a right to be upset when they were eaten without permission. The sister didn't ask and didn't know their value. The author's reaction was yelling, which might be seen as harsh, especially since the sister didn't have bad intentions. However, the author later apologized and tried to make amends, which shows they feel remorseful.\n\nThe key points here are intent. The sister didn't mean to steal or be malicious; it was an honest mistake. The author, though, had a legitimate reason to be upset because they lost money. But the way they handled it\u2014yelling and causing a rift\u2014might be where they went wrong. Emotional response is human, but maybe they overreacted given the sister's lack of intent.\n\nAlso, the author did take responsibility by going to their sister's college and apologizing. That shows they recognized their mistake in handling the situation, even if the initial action wasn't entirely their fault. The sister's perspective was that it was over something small, so the author's anger might not have been justified in terms of the emotional impact versus the financial loss.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about losing money on an item they sold. However, their reaction was perhaps disproportionate. The sister didn't intend harm, so yelling might be where the author made an error. But since the author took steps to fix the relationship, maybe the fault isn't severe. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author's right to be upset vs. their reaction. I think the main issue is the reaction. The sister's actions were a mistake, not theft. Therefore, the author's yelling was unwarranted. Hence, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they overreacted given the sister's lack of intent. However, considering the financial aspect, it's a bit tricky. But in terms of interpersonal relations, the author's reaction was the problem.\n"
