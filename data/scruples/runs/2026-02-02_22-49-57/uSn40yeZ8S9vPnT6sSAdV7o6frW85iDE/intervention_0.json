My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about the author yelling at their sister for eating $45 cough drops they were selling on eBay. The sister went back to college and hasn't talked to them since. The author later went to apologize and explained the situation to the buyer, getting a 3-star review.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author made money from an auction, but the sister ate the item they were supposed to deliver. The author got angry and yelled, leading to a rift. Now, they feel bad and tried to fix it by apologizing and not making the sister pay. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was in the wrong. Let's think about both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the cough drops were intended for sale, not for personal use. The sister didn't know their value or that they were for selling. The author lost money and a customer. Their reaction, while harsh, might stem from frustration over a financial loss and having to deal with a disappointed buyer. \n\nOn the other hand, yelling at a sibling over an honest mistake might be excessive. The sister didn't intend to cause harm, and the author's anger led to a significant fallout. The value of the cough drops might be high to the author but not to the sister, who might not realize the financial implications. \n\nThe author did take steps to make amends by apologizing and not making the sister pay, which shows they recognized the mistake in their reaction. However, the initial response of yelling could be seen as overreacting. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have secured the item better to prevent such a situation. The sister's actions were a mistake, but the author's response might have been too harsh given the context of family. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's mistake was in how they handled the situation, not necessarily in being upset about losing the item. So, they might not be entirely in the wrong, but their reaction was inappropriate. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the sister made an honest mistake and the author overreacted, leading to a broken relationship, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) for the yelling. But the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut I need to weigh the emotional harm caused. Yelling at a sibling over a mistake, even if it's costly, can be seen as wrong because it's a family issue. The author's financial loss is valid, but the way they handled it could be better. So maybe the answer is A. But the user's edit shows they took steps to fix it, which mitigates some blame. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is B, because the author had a valid reason to be upset, but their reaction was excessive. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the sister didn't know the value, the author's yelling is more unjustified. So perhaps A is correct. Hmm. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards A because the author overreacted to an honest family mistake, even if they had financial reasons."
