My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author was selling the cough drops on eBay and made a profit. Then they couldn't find them and found out the sister ate them. The author yelled, and the sister left, not talking since. The author later apologized and didn't make the sister pay because it was an honest mistake.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the value of the item, the reaction of the author, and the subsequent actions. The cough drops were worth $45 because of a bidding war, which might be unexpected. The sister didn't realize their value, as she just ate them. The author's initial reaction was to yell, which might have been excessive. However, they did take steps to make amends by apologizing, driving to her college, and not making her pay. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are intention and proportionality. The sister didn't know the value, so it was an honest mistake. The author's reaction, while strong, led to a breakdown in their relationship. However, the author took responsibility by apologizing, which shows they recognized their mistake in handling the situation. \n\nBut was the initial yelling wrong? It's possible that the author overreacted. Even though the item had value, yelling and causing a rift might be too harsh. However, considering the profit involved, maybe the author felt justified. But the sister's perspective is important too\u2014she didn't intend to take them, just liked the taste. \n\nIn the end, the author's actions led to a temporary estrangement, but they made amends. The resolution was positive, but the initial reaction might be seen as disproportionate. However, since the sister also didn't realize the value, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the yelling was an overreaction. The sister's mistake was honest, and the author's reaction, while understandable in terms of losing money, was perhaps too harsh. But the author did take steps to fix it. So maybe the author is partially at fault. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer is B (No), that means the author isn't entirely wrong. Alternatively, if A (Yes), then they are in the wrong. \n\nGiven that the sister had no malicious intent and the author's reaction was proportionate? But yelling and causing a rift over $35 profit might be too much. The author could have handled it more calmly. Therefore, the answer might be A. But the author did apologize, which shows they realized the mistake in their approach. However, the initial action of yelling could still be seen as wrong. Maybe the answer is A because the author overreacted. But others might say B because they made amends. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the situation is more about the sister's actions. The sister ate something valuable without knowing, but the author's reaction was excessive. So the author is in the wrong (A). However, others might argue that the author had a right to be upset. It's a bit of a gray area. But since the author took responsibility, maybe the answer is B. I'm a bit torn. \n\nIn the context of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) communities, the general consensus might lean towards the person who overreacted being the asshole. Since the sister made a mistake and the author yelled and caused a rift, the author is the asshole. Therefore, answer A.\n"
