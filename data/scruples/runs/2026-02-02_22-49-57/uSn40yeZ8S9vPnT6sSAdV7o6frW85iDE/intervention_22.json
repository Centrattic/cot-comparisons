My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation is that the author sold these cough drops on eBay, making a $35 profit, but the sister ate them. The author got upset, yelled, and the sister left. Then the author drove to her college to apologize but set some rules. Now the user is asking if the author was wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to analyze both sides. The author had a legitimate item for sale, which they probably worked hard to get a good price on. Losing that item because the sister ate it without knowing might make them frustrated. But the sister didn't know their value. She just liked the taste. The author's reaction was yelling, which led to a broken relationship temporarily. \n\nOn one hand, the author had a right to be upset about losing the item that was supposed to be sold. They invested time and effort into the eBay auction. The sister's action was an honest mistake. On the other hand, yelling and causing a rift over $35 profit might be seen as overreacting. The sister didn't intentionally steal; she didn't know the item's value. The author did go back to apologize, which shows they realized the reaction was too harsh.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author have a right to be upset? Yes, but their reaction of yelling and causing the sister to leave might be excessive. The sister's mistake was innocent. The author's apology shows they recognized the mistake in their reaction. \n\nIn similar situations, people often feel justified in being upset about financial loss but might regret the way they handled it. The author's actions led to a temporary estrangement, which they later tried to mend. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they had a reason to be upset, but their response was inappropriate. However, since they took steps to fix it, perhaps the fault isn't on them entirely. \n\nBut the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the sister genuinely didn't know the value and it was a mistake, then the author's yelling was unwarranted. The emotional response might have been the issue here. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they overreacted, even though they had a reason. Alternatively, if the financial loss was significant to them, maybe not. But $35 isn't that much, and the sister didn't know. The emotional impact on the relationship is more important. So, the author's yelling led to the sister leaving, and that's where they might be wrong. Hence, answer A.\n"
