My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they sold some expensive cough drops on eBay, their sister ate them, they yelled, and then the sister went back to college and they haven't talked since. The person feels bad and ended up apologizing but still gave the buyer a 3-star review.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was selling items on eBay, which means they were expecting to make a profit. The cough drops were part of that, and someone bid up to $45. The sister ate them, which caused the problem. The author confronted her, yelled, and that led to a breakdown in their relationship.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the sister ate the cough drops without knowing their value. Maybe she didn't realize they were for sale, especially if there's a brand like Supreme, which might be a high-value item. The author was upset because they lost $35 profit. Yelling in the moment might be understandable, but the reaction was harsh enough to cause a rift.\n\nOn the other hand, the author took the time to apologize later and even adjusted their approach by not making the sister pay. They also took responsibility by contacting the buyer. However, the initial reaction of yelling over an honest mistake might be seen as disproportionate, especially since the sister wasn't aware of the item's value. The author's decision to apologize and make amends shows they realized their mistake.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the sister had no intention of stealing and just made a mistake, the author's reaction might have been too harsh. The value of the item is significant, but the relationship with a sibling is also important. The author's anger over losing money versus the sister's innocent mistake tips the scale towards the author being in the wrong, at least partially.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they overreacted to an honest mistake, even though they later took steps to mend the situation. The key point is the initial reaction and the impact on the relationship compared to the sister's lack of malicious intent.\n"
