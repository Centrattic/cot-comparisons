My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The sister ended up going back to college and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, the context: The author sells items on eBay and had an auction for Supreme cough drops that sold for $45, making $35 profit. They couldn't find the item until they saw the sister ate them. Then they yelled, and the sister left.\n\nThe author feels bad and later apologized, but the sister didn't know the item's value. The key points here are intent and the value of the item. The sister didn't know they were valuable; she just liked the taste. The author was upset because it was a significant profit for them, but the sister had no idea. \n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? Well, yelling is a strong reaction. Even if the item was valuable, the sister's mistake was honest. The author could have been more understanding. However, the situation involves the author's business, which they might take seriously. The sister's action led to a loss, but she wasn't malicious. The author did apologize and make amends, which shows they recognized the mistake. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's reaction was excessive given the sister's lack of intent to harm. So, the answer is A (author is in the wrong). But wait, maybe the value is subjective. The author valued it highly, but the sister didn't know. Still, the yelling was disproportionate. So, leaning towards A.\n"
