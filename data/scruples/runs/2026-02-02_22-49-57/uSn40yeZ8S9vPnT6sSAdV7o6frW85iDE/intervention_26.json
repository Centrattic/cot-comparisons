My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister eating cough drops that the writer was selling for $45, leading to an argument and the sister leaving. The writer then went to apologize and explain, and the sister didn't know the value or the brand.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The writer was selling these cough drops, which they probably considered valuable because of the auction price. The sister ate them without knowing their value. The writer yelled, which might be an overreaction, but the sister's action was careless. \n\nThe writer later apologized and even went to the sister's college to make amends, showing they took responsibility. The sister's perspective is that the writer was being harsh over cough drops, which she didn't realize were valuable. That suggests the writer's anger might have been excessive, but the sister's mistake was in not checking the items. \n\nThe key points are whether the writer had a right to be upset about losing $35 profit and if yelling was justified. Yelling can be seen as an overreaction, but given the emotional investment in the sale, maybe it's understandable. However, the resolution where the writer apologizes and the sister's lack of knowledge about the item's value might mean the writer was partially at fault for not securing the item properly. \n\nSo, in the end, the writer might not be entirely in the wrong because the sister did take the item, but the writer's reaction could be seen as too harsh. However, since they made amends and acknowledged the sister's perspective, maybe the blame is shared. The answer might depend on cultural norms and what's considered an acceptable reaction. But given the sister's lack of knowledge, the writer could be seen as not entirely wrong either.\n"
