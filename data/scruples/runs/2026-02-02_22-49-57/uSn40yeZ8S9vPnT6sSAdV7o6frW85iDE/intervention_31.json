My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person who sells designer cough drops on eBay and made $45 from an auction. Their sister ate them, not knowing their value, and the author yelled at her, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, the author made money from the item, which the sister consumed. The sister didn't know they were valuable or that they were for sale. The author was upset because someone else was supposed to get them, which is why they were in the closet. The sister had no idea she was doing something wrong. \n\nThe author yelled at her, which caused the sister to leave for college and not talk since. The author later apologized but still set some ground rules. The sister's perspective was that it was just normal cough drops, maybe not seeing the brand or logo. The author didn't make her pay for them because it was an honest mistake.\n\nNow, considering intent: The sister didn't know the drops were valuable. The author, on the other hand, was holding them for a sale, which is a business matter. The author might feel that the sister should have known better, but since the sister didn't know, maybe the author overreacted. Yelling is a strong reaction, especially over something that the other person didn't intend to misappropriate. The author realized this later and took steps to apologize, so maybe they felt guilty after.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the sister genuinely didn't know the value and it was a mistake, then yelling might be excessive. However, the author did own the item and expected it to be kept until the sale. The sister's actions caused a financial loss (the $35 profit). But the key is whether the author's response was proportionate. Losing $35 is not a massive amount, and the sister didn't act maliciously. The author's yelling led to a long-term rift, which seems more damaging than the item's value. The author did apologize, which is good, but the initial reaction might have been wrong because of the sister's lack of intent to harm.\n\nSo, maybe the author is partially in the wrong. But the sister also didn't ask if she could take them. However, considering she didn't know their value, maybe it's a shared misunderstanding. The question is whether the author overreacted. Since they later apologized and made it clear it was an honest mistake, the main issue is the initial yelling. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they overreacted, but some might argue B because they had a right to be upset. But given the sister's lack of intent, the author's response was disproportionate.\n"
