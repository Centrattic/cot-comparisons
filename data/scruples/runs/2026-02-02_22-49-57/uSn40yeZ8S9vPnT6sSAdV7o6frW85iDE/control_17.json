My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author sells designer items on eBay. They put a Supreme cough drop on auction, which sold for $45, giving them a $35 profit. The sister ate the cough drops without realizing their value. The author yelled at her, leading to a fallout where the sister went back to college and hasn't talked to them since. The author later apologized and went to her college to make amends, but got a 3-star review from the buyer.\n\nSo, the key points here. The sister didn't know the cough drops were valuable; she just ate them because she liked the taste. The author, however, was upset about losing $35 profit. Yelling at someone over an honest mistake, especially when the item's value wasn't apparent to the sister, seems harsh. The author's reaction led to a significant strain on their relationship, which they later tried to fix. \n\nBut was the author in the wrong? Well, the sister's action was accidental. The author should have considered that the sister couldn't know the item's value since it was in their home. Maybe the author should have stored valuable items more securely. Yelling over a mistake that costs $35, especially when the sister didn't intend harm, is probably excessive. The author's regret and subsequent apology suggest they realized their mistake. However, the initial reaction was to yell, which is where the fault lies. \n\nThe answer isn't straightforward. While the author made a mistake in handling the situation, the sister's lack of awareness might mitigate some blame. But ultimately, the author's emotional response was disproportionate given the circumstances. So, the author is more in the wrong here.\n"
