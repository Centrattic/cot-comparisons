My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author yelled at their sister for eating expensive cough drops they were selling. The sister then went back to college and didn't talk to them since. The author later apologized and went to see her, and the sister felt it was over a normal cough drop.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author spent time and effort to get those cough drops, sold them for a profit. The sister ate them without knowing their value. The author's reaction was yelling, which led to a rift. The author later took steps to fix the situation by apologizing and setting boundaries. \n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? Well, the sister's intention was not malicious\u2014she ate them because she liked the taste. The author's anger was over a financial loss, but the sister didn't know they were valuable. Yelling might have been disproportionate. However, the author did take responsibility and made amends. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on whether the action was justified and if the person handled it appropriately. The initial reaction might have been harsh, but the follow-up actions (apologizing, not making her pay) show the author took some responsibility. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (Not in the wrong) because the sister's mistake was honest, and the author made efforts to reconcile. But maybe the initial yelling was a mistake, but the overall outcome was resolved. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong.\n"
