My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over cough drops. \n\nFirst, the sister ate the cough drops that were part of an eBay auction where the author made a $35 profit. The author found the drops in her sister's room and yelled at her. The sister then left for college and hasn't talked since.\n\nSo, the main points here: The sister didn't know the value of the cough drops because she didn't see the logo. The author was upset because they were for sale, but the sister just ate them. The author yelled, which led to the sister leaving. The author later apologized and didn't make her pay.\n\nFrom the sister's perspective, she might have thought they were regular cough drops. The author knew the item's value but didn't communicate that to her. The author's reaction was intense for a $35 mistake. Yelling at a family member over this might be seen as overreacting, especially since the sister didn't intend to cause harm. The author did make amends by apologizing, which is a good step, but the initial reaction was the issue. \n\nSo, considering intent and the value of the item, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting. However, the fact that they were selling the item and the sister was supposed to handle it properly could also play a role. But since the sister was unaware of the value, it's an honest mistake. The author's responsibility was to keep the item safe and maybe inform family about its value. The yelling seems disproportionate, leading to the sister not talking to them. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
