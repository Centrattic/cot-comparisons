My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister eating cough drops they were selling on eBay for $45, leading to a yelling incident and the sister leaving. The author later apologized and didn't make the sister pay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author worked hard to make $35 profit from the auction, so losing the item would matter. The sister ate them without knowing the value, maybe. But yelling at her over it, especially leading to her leaving, seems harsh. Did the author overreact? The sister might not have realized the value, so maybe she didn't mean to be malicious. However, the author did get angry and yelled, which could be seen as disproportionate. But the author also took responsibility by apologizing and explaining to the buyer. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, getting angry over a financial loss is understandable, but yelling and causing a rift might not be justified. The sister didn't know the value, so the author's reaction could be seen as not considering her perspective. But the author later took steps to make amends. So maybe the wrong here isn't absolute. The key points are whether the sister intended harm and the author's response. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the sister made a mistake, but the author's initial reaction was harsh. However, some might argue that the author was justified in being upset about losing the item. But the consensus often values empathy and communication. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong but could have handled it better. Since the options are A or B, and the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, maybe B is the answer.\n"
