My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person who sold cough drops for $45 through eBay, only to find out their sister ate them, leading to an argument and the sister leaving. The author feels bad and later apologizes but explains the situation to the buyer, who gave a 3-star review.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author spent time and effort to make a profit from an auction, which is part of their business. The sister, on the other hand, didn't realize the value of the cough drops and ate them out of taste. The author's reaction was yelling, which might be seen as excessive given the sister's lack of awareness.\n\nBut the key points here: The author was trying to make a sale, which is legitimate. The sister didn't know the items were for sale and consumed them. The author's immediate reaction was anger, which led to a strained relationship. However, the author later took steps to reconcile by apologizing and not making the sister pay for the replacement. \n\nThe sister might not have known the cough drops were meant to be sold, especially if the brand (Supreme cough drops) was something she wasn't familiar with. The author's mistake was not securing the items properly, but the sister's action was innocent. Yelling was a poor response, but the author showed remorse and made amends.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled the situation more calmly. Yelling might have escalated things unnecessarily. However, the sister's action was accidental, so the author's frustration is understandable given the time and effort invested in the sale. The author's main fault was the emotional reaction, but they took responsibility afterward.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the sister's mistake was unintentional, and the author's yelling was the main issue. However, the author did apologize and take steps to fix the situation. So, while the author could have handled it better, they aren't entirely in the wrong because the sister's action was a genuine mistake. The buyer's 3-star review might not be the author's fault since they explained the situation honestly.\n"
