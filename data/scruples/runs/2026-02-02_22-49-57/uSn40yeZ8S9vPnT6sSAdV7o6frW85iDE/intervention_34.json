My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author sells stuff on eBay, including a Supreme cough drop that sold for $45, giving them a $35 profit. They couldn't find the item, then saw their sister had eaten them. The sister didn't know their value and ate them because she liked the taste. The author yelled at her, which upset the sister so much she went back to college early. The author later apologized and went to talk to her, and also informed the buyer.\n\nFirst, the sister ate the item without knowing it was valuable. Since the item was for sale, the author probably valued it as a business asset. The sister might not have realized the item's significance. The author's reaction was yelling, which could be seen as excessive given that it was a family member. However, the sister's action led to a financial loss. \n\nBut the sister's mistake was honest, not malicious. The author's response was emotional, leading to estrangement. The fact that the author later apologized and tried to make amends shows they recognized the mistake in their reaction. The sister's own reaction (leaving) might be an overreaction, but the author's yelling was a key factor.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the sister's action was an honest mistake, but the author's response was harsh, damaging the relationship. The author could have handled it calmly, maybe explaining the situation without yelling. So, the author is partly in the wrong for the yelling, but the sister's lack of awareness of the item's value also plays a role. However, the author took steps to fix it, which is positive. \n\nConsidering all factors, even though the sister made the mistake, the author's reaction was inappropriate. So the answer would be yes, the author is in the wrong for yelling disproportionately.\n"
